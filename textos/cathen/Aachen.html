<h1>Aachen</h1>  

<p>(In <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French</a>, <em>Aix-la-Chapelle</em>, the name by which the city is generally known; in Latin <em>Aquae Grani</em>, later <em>Aquisgranum</em>).

<p><a href="../images/01001abx.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=left src="../images/01001abt.jpg"></a> The city of Aachen lies in a <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> valley, surrounded by wooded heights, on the Wurm, a tributary of the Roer, on its way to the Meuse. Population, 1 December, 1905, 151,922 (including the Parish of Forst); <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 139,485; <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 10,552; <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Israelites</a>, 1,658; other denominations, 227. <span class="stiki">1990 Population: about 250,000 &mdash; <em>Ed.</em></span>

<p>The city owes its origin to its salubrious springs which were already known in the time of the Romans. There appears to have been a royal court in Aachen under the Merovingians, but it rose to greater importance under <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> who chose it as his favourite place of residence, adorned it with a noble-imperial palace and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and gave orders that he should be <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> there.

<p>The precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> obtained by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otho III</a> for the imperial <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> were the objects of great <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> (the so-called "Shrine Pilgrimages") which drew countless swarms of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> from Germany, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, England, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, and other countries. From the middle of the fourteenth century onwards, however it became customary to expose the four great <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> only once in every seven years, a custom which still holds. These <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, the coronations of the German emperors (thirty-seven of whom were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> there between 813 and 1531), the flourishing industries and the privileges conferred by the various emperors combined to make Aachen one of the first cities of the Empire.

<p>The decay of Aachen dates from the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> strife of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">German Reformation</a>. Albrecht von Muenster first preached <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> there in the year 1524 but was afterwards forbidden to preach the new views and executed on account of two <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murders</a> committed during his stay in the cities of Maastricht and Wesel. A new <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> community was soon, however, formed in Aachen, which gradually attained such strength as to provoke a rising in 1581, force the election of a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> burgomaster, and defy the Emperor for several years. The Ban of the empire was, therefore, pronounced against the city in 1597 and put in force by the Duke of Julich, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> overlord of the city. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were restored to their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> invited to Aachen, in 1600. In 1611, however, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> rose afresh, plundered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, drove out the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> officials in 1612, and opened their gates to troops from <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a>. The Ban of the Empire was again laid on the city, and executed by the Spanish general, Spinola. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> ringleaders were tried or exiled, and many other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> banished. These troubles, together with a great fire which destroyed 4,000 houses, put an end to the prosperity of the city.

<p>Two treaties of peace were concluded at Aachen during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. By the first, dated 2 May 1668, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> was compelled, by the Triple Alliance between England, the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, to abandon the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the Spanish Netherlands, to restore the Franche Comte, which he had conquered, and to content himself with twelve <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> fortresses. The second treaty, dated 18 October, 1748, put an end to the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1793 and 1794, Aachen was occupied by the French, incorporated with the French Republic in 1798 and 1802, and made the capital of the Department of the Roer. By the terms of the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">French Concordat of 1801</a> Aachen was made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> subject to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, and composed of 79 first class, and 754 second class, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The first and only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Marcus Antonius Berdolet (b. 13 September, 1740, at Rougemont, in <a href="../cathen/01341c.htm">Alsace</a> 3; d. 13 August, 1809), who, for the most part, left the government of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Martin Wilhelm Fonck (b. 28 October, 1752, at Goch; d. 26 June, 1830, as <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">Provost</a> of Cologne <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a>). After the death of Bishop Berdolet the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was governed by Le Camus, Vicar General of Meaux; after his death, in 1814, by the two <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicars-general</a> Fonck and Klinkenberg. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, "De Salute Animarum," dated 16 July, 1821 which regulated church matters in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> anew, did away with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, and transferred most of its territory to the archdiocese of Cologne; a collegiate chapter, consisting of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and six canons, taking the place of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 1825. In 1815 Aachen became <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> territory. The Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle sat there from 30 September to 11 November, 1818, and was attended by the sovereigns of Russia, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and by plenipotentiaries from France and England, to determine the relations between France and the Powers. France obtained a reduction of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> indemnity and the early departure of the army of occupation, and joined the Holy Alliance; the other four Powers guaranteed the throne of France to the Bourbons, against any revolution that might occur. Aachen, under <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> government, returned to prosperity, chiefly through the development of the coal mines in the neighborhood, which facilitated several extensive industries (such as the manufacture of linen, needles, machinery, glass, woolen, and half-woollen stuffs, etc.), but also in consequence of the large number of visitors to its hot springs.

<p><a href="../images/01001aax.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/01001aat.jpg"></a> The minster ranks first among the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church buildings</a>; it consists of three distinct parts: the octagon, the choir, and the crown, or ring, of <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, the octagon forming the central portion. This last is the most important monument of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carolingian</a> <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architecture</a>, it was built between 796 and 804, in the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, by Master Odo of Metz, and modelled after the Italian circular church of San Vitale at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. It was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Pope Leo III</a>. It is an eight-angled, <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">domed</a> building, 54 feet in diameter, with a sixteen-sided circumference of 120 feet, and a height of 124 feet. The interior of the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> is adorned with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> on a gold ground, executed by Salviati of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, in 1882, representing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> surrounded by the four and twenty Ancients of the <a href="../cathen/01594b.htm">Apocalypse</a>. The main building was decorated with marble and <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> in 1902, after the designs of H. Schaper. Over the spot supposed to be the site of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> grave hangs an enormous corona of lamps, the gift of the <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick I, Barbarossa</a>; in the choir of the octagon, the so-called upper minster, stands <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> throne, made of great-slabs of white marble, where, after the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>, the German emperors received the homage of their nobles. The rich upper choir, built in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, joins on to the eastern side of the octagon; it was begun in the second half of the fourteenth century, and dedicated in 1414. The thirteen <a href="../cathen/15653b.htm">windows</a>, each 100 feet high, have been filled with new coloured glass; on the pillars between them stand fourteen <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> (the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>), dating from the fifteenth century. Among the treasures of the choir should be mentioned the famous Gospel-pulpit, enriched with gold plates, the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07227a.htm">Emperor Henry II</a>, the throne canopy of the fifteenth century the new Gothic <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of 1876, and the memorial stone which marks the spot where the <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Emperor Otto III</a> formerly lay. The lower portions of the <a href="../cathen/02394d.htm">bell-tower</a>, to the west of the octagon, belong to the Carolingian period, the Gothic superstructure dates from 1884. Of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> which surround the whole building, the so-called Hungarian <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> contains the minster treasury, which includes a large number of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">vessels</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>, the most important being those known as the four "Great Relics," namely, the cloak of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, the swaddling-clothes of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Infant Jesus</a>, the loin-cloth worn by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> on the Cross, and the cloth on which lay the head of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> after his beheading. They are exposed every seven years and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by thousands of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>.

<p>Among the other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of Aachen, the following may be mentioned:<ul><li>the Church of Our Lady, a <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> in brick, built by Friederich Statz in 1859 <li>the Church of St. Foillan, the oldest <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church in the city, which dates, in its present form, from the Gothic period, and was renovated between 1883 and 1888; and <li>the Romanesque Church of St. James, built between 1877 and 1888.</ul> The most important secular building is the Rathaus, built between 1333 and 1350, on the site of, and out of the ruins of, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> imperial palace, and completely renovated between 1882 and 1903. The <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is adorned with the statues of fifty-four German emperors, the great hall (<em>Kaisersaal</em>) with eight frescoes from designs by <a href="../cathen/12794a.htm">Alfred Rethel</a>.

<p>In Aachen there are foundations established by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/01306b.htm">Alexians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>. A number of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders also have establishments, including:<ul> <li>the Sisters of St. Charles, <li>the Christensians, <li>the <a href="../cathen/05388a.htm">Sisters of St. Elizabeth</a>, <li>the Franciscan Sisters, <li>the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, <li>the <a href="../cathen/12251a.htm">Sisters of the Poor Child Jesus</a>, <li>the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <li>the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, and <li>the Sisters of St. Vincent.</ul>

<h2 id="councils">Councils of aachen</h2>

<p>A number of important councils were held here in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>In the mixed council of 798, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> proclaimed an important capitulary of eighty-one chapters, largely a repetition of earlier ecclesiastical legislation, that was accepted by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and acquired canonical authority.

<p>At the council of 799, after a discussion of six days Felix, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, avowed himself overcome by <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> and withdrew his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> theory of Adoptianism.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of 816, 817, 818, and 819, clerical and monastic <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> was the chief issue, and the famous "Regula Aquensis" was made obligatory on all establishments of canons and <a href="../cathen/03255b.htm">canonesses</a> (see <a href="../cathen/10472a.htm">WESTERN MONASTICISM</a>), while a new revision of the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> was imposed on the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of that order by the <a href="../cathen/12711a.htm">reformer</a> <a href="../cathen/02467a.htm">Benedict of Aniane</a>.

<p>The synod of 836 was largely attended and devoted itself to the restoration of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> that had been gravely affected by the civil wars between Louis the Pious and his sons.

<p>From 860 to 862 three councils were occupied with the question of the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> of King Lothaire I from his wife, Theutberga.

<p>In 1166 took place the famous <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> council, approved by the <a href="../cathen/11515a.htm">Antipope Paschal III</a>, in which was decreed the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, that was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> celebrated 29 December of that year.
