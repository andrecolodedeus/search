<h1>Abbey</h1>  

<p>A monastery <a href="../cathen/10458a.htm">canonically erected</a> and autonomous, with a community of not fewer than twelve religious; <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> under the government of an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>; <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> under that of an <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>.

<p><a href="../images/01010aax.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=left src="../images/01010aat.jpg"></a> An autonomous <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> is ruled by a superior who bears the title of <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> instead of that of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>; but this distinction was unknown in the first centuries of monastic history. Such were the twelve great <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> of England, immediately governed by a <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a>, the diocesan being considered the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> were founded as cells, or offshoots from the great abbeys, and remained dependent on the parent house, by whose <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> the prior was appointed, and was removable at will. Originally the term monastery designated, both in the East and in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, the dwelling either of a solitary or of a community; while <em>caenobium, congregatio, fraternitas, asceterion,</em> etc. were applied solely to the houses of communities. <a href="../cathen/10452a.htm">Monasteries</a> took their names from either their locality, their founders, or from some <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> whose life has shed lustre upon them; and later, from some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were there preserved, or who was locally an object of special <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Palestine, as may be gathered from the "Peregrinatio Etheriae," also selected for their monasteries sites famous for their connection with some <a href="../bible/index.html">biblical</a> event or personage. The first <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> generally settled in solitary places, away from the haunts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, though sometimes they were to be found also in cities like Alexandria, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>. Monasteries, founded in country places, not infrequently gathered around them settlements which, particularly in England and Germany, in the course of time developed into great centres of population and industry. Many important towns owe their origin to this cause; but the tendency never showed itself in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and the East. Though the sites selected were often beautiful, many settlements, especially in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, were of set purpose made amid arid <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a>. Nor was this form of austerity confined to them. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, the more dismal and savage did this site appear to be, the more did it appeal to the rigid mood of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>. Still, the preference, at least with the majority of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, was for fertile lands, suitable for cultivation and agriculture.

<p><a href="../images/01010abx.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/01010abt.jpg"></a> The formation of communities dates from pre-Christian times, as witness the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a>; but the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monastic foundations of which we have definite knowledge were simply groups of huts without any orderly arrangement, erected about the abode of some solitary famous for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, around whom had gathered a knot of disciples anxious to learn his doctrine and to imitate his way of life. Communities that had outgrown the accommodation afforded by their monasteries founded branch houses, and thus propagated themselves like the swarming of a beehive. <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishops</a> founded many monasteries, while others owed their existence to the piety of princes and nobles, who also generously endowed them. The <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451) forbade the foundation of any monastery without the permission of the local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, thus obviating the difficulties likely to arise from irresponsible action. This became the universal law, and it also safeguarded these institutions against disbandment or ruin, since they enjoyed a certain sacredness of character in popular estimation. <a href="../cathen/10452a.htm">Double monasteries</a> were those in which dwelt communities both of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> at one and the same time, under the government of a common superior, either an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> or an <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian</a> suppressed them in the East on account of the abuses which this arrangement might lead to; but the custom long prevailed in England, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where strict rules, keeping the sexes entirely separate at all times, minimized the danger of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a>. Examples of these were the houses of the <a href="../cathen/06556b.htm">Order of St. Gilbert of Sempringham</a>; and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Faremoutiers, Chelles, <a href="../cathen/12764b.htm">Remiremont</a>, etc.

<p><a href="../images/01010acx.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/01010act.jpg"></a> In the beginning, solitaries attached no importance whatever to the form of design of their dwellings. They made use of anything that Nature afforded, or their circumstances suggested. In the East, especially in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, abandoned tombs and burial caves; in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, cave and rude huts constructed of branches of trees, mud, or sun-dried bricks, and furnished with the barest necessities, sheltered many an early solitary. When the number of such solitaries in a certain locality grew, and huts increased in proportion, gradually they came to subject themselves to a common superior and to follow a common rule of life; but they had no common buildings except a church to which they all repaired for the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">services</a>. At Tabennae on the Nile, in Upper Egypt, however, <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a> laid the foundations of the coenobitical life, arranging everything in an organized manner. He built several monasteries, each containing about 1,600 separate cells laid out in lines as an encampment, where the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> slept and performed some of their manual tasks; but there were large halls for their common needs, as the church, refectory, kitchen, even an infirmary and a guest-house. An enclosure protecting all these buildings gave the settlement the appearance of a walled village; but every part was of the utmost simplicity, without any pretense to <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> style. It was this arrangement of monasteries, inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a>, which finally spread throughout Palestine, and received the name of <em>laurae,</em> that is "lanes" or "alleys." In addition to these congregations of solitaries, all living in huts apart, there were <em>caenobia,</em> monasteries wherein the inmates lived a common life, none of them being permitted to retire to the cells of a <em>laurae</em> before they had therein undergone a lengthy period of training. In time this form of common life superseded that of the older <em>laurae.</em>

<p><a href="../cathen/10472a.htm">Monasticism in the West</a> owes its development to St. Benedict (480-543). His <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule</a> spread rapidly, and the number of monasteries founded in England, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and Italy between 520 and 700 was very great. More than 15,000 Abbeys, following the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a>, had been established before the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> in 1415. No special plan was adopted or followed in the building of the first <em>caenobia,</em> or monasteries as we understand the term today. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> simply copied the buildings familiar to them, the Roman house or villa, whose plan, throughout the extent of the Roman Empire, was practically uniform. The founders of monasteries had often merely to install a community in an already existing villa. When they had to build, the natural instinct was to copy old models. If they fixed upon a site with existing buildings in good repair, they simply adapted them to their requirements, as St. Benedict did at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, not disdaining to turn to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> uses what had before served for the worship of idols. The spread of the monastic life gradually effected great changes in the model of the Roman villa. The various avocations followed by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> required suitable buildings, which were at first erected not upon any premeditated plan, but just as the need for them arose. These requirements, however, being practically the same in every country, resulted in practically similar arrangements everywhere.

<p><a href="../images/01010adx.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/01010adt.jpg"></a> The monastic lawgivers of the East have left no written record of the principal parts of their monasteries. St. Benedict, however, mentions the chief component parts with great exactness, in his <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratory</a>, dormitory, refectory, kitchen, workshops, cellars for stores, infirmary, novitiate, guest-house, and by inference, the conference-room or <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>. These, therefore, find a place in all <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbeys, which all followed one common plan, occasionally modified to suit local conditions. The chief buildings were arranged around a quadrangle. Taking the normal <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">English</a> arrangement, it will be found that the church was situated as a rule on the north side, its high and massive walls affording the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> a good shelter from the rough north winds. The buildings of the choir, <a href="../cathen/12395a.htm">presbytery</a>, and retrochapels extending more to the east, gave some protection from the biting east wind. Canterbury and Chester, however, were exceptions, their churches being on the southern side, where also they were frequently found in warm and sunny climates, with the obvious purpose of obtaining some shelter from the heat of the sun. The choir was ordinarily entered, in the normally planned <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">English</a> monasteries, by a door at the junction of the northern and eastern <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>, another door at the western end of the north <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> being reserved for the more solemn <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">processions</a>. Although in the course of time there came into existence private rooms (chequer or <em>saccarium</em>) wherein the officials transacted their business, and later still private cells are to be met with, the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> were, in the main, the dwelling-place of the entire community, and here the common life was lived. The northern <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, looking south, was the warmest of the four divisions. Here was the prior's seat, next to the door of the church; then those of the rest, more or less in order. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> place was at the northeastern corner. The novice-master with his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> occupied the southern portion of the eastern <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, while the junior <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were opposite in the western limb. The cold, sunless, southern walk was not used; but out of it opened the refectory, with the lavatory close at hand. In Cistercian houses it stood at right angles to the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. Near the refectory was the conventual kitchen with its various offices. The <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a> opened out of the eastern <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, as near the church as possible. The position of the dormitory was not so fixed. Normally, it communicated with the southern <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, hence it was over the eastern <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>; occasionally it stood at right angles to it, as at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Winchester</a>, or on the western side, as at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>. The infirmary usually appears to have been to the east of the dormitory, but no fixed position was assigned to it. The guest-house was situated where it would be least likely to interfere the privacy of the monastery. In later days, when books had multiplied, a special building for the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was added, at right angles to one of the walks of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. To these may be added the calefactory, the parlour, or <em>locutorium,</em> the almonry, and the offices of the <a href="../cathen/11183a.htm">obedientiaries</a>; but these additional buildings fitted into the general plan where they best might, and their disposition differed somewhat in the various monasteries. The <a href="../cathen/16025b.htm">English Cistercian</a> houses, of which there are so many extensive and beautiful remains, were mainly arranged after the plan of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, the mother-house, with slight local variations.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> monastery differed considerably in its arrangements from those of other orders. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were practically <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, and each occupied a small detached cottage, containing three rooms, which they left only to attend the services of the church and on certain days when the community met together in the refectory. These cottages opened out of three sides of a quadrangular <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, and on the fourth side were the church, refectory, <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>, and other public offices. Both <em>laurae</em> and <em>caenobium</em> were surrounded by walls which protected the inmates either from the intrusion of seculars or from the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of marauders. No <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> might go beyond this enclosure without permission. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the earlier period considered this separation from the outer world as a matter of prime importance. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> were never permitted to enter the precincts of monasteries for men; even access to the church was oftentimes denied them, or, if accorded admission, as at <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, they were relegated to a strictly limited space, farthest removed from the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks'</a> choir. Even greater strictness was observed in safe-guarding the enclosure of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The danger of attack from <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> hordes necessitated, in the case of Eastern monasteries, the erection of lofty walls, with only one entrance place many feet above the ground, reached by a stairway or drawbridge that could be raised for defense. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, not standing in fear of such incursions, did not need such elaborate safeguards, and therefore contented themselves with ordinary enclosure walls. A religious of mature age and character was selected for the responsible office of <a href="../cathen/12284b.htm">porter</a>, and to act as the channel of communication between the inmates and the outside world. His chamber was always close by, so that he might be at hand to fulfill his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of receiving the poor and of announcing the arrival of guests. In the Egyptian monasteries the guest-house, situated near the entrance gateway, was place under the charge of the porter, who was assisted by the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. St. Benedict so arranged that it should be a building distinct from the monastery itself, although within the enclosure. It had its own kitchen, served by two of the brethren appointed for that purpose annually; a refectory where the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> took his meals with distinguished guests, and, when he thought fit, invited some of the seniors to join him there; an apartment for the solemn reception of guests, in which the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of washing their feet, as prescribed by the Rule, was performed by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and his community; and a dormitory suitably furnished. Thus the guests received every attention due to them by the laws of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> and hospitality, and the community, while gaining the merit of dispensing them in a large-hearted way, through the appointed officials, suffered no disturbance of their own peace and quiet. It was usual for the buildings dedicated for hospitality to be divided into four: one for the reception of guests of distinction, another for poor travelers and pilgrims, a third for merchants arriving on business with the cellarer, and the last for monk-visitors.

<p>Formerly, as now, monastic communities always and everywhere extended a generous hospitality to all comers as an important way of fulfilling their social <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>; hence monasteries lying on or near the main highways enjoyed particular consideration and esteem. Where guests were frequent and numerous, the accommodation provided for them was on a commensurate scale. And as it was necessary for great personages to travel accompanied by a crowd of retainers, vast stables and other outhouses were added to these monastic hostels. Later <em>xenodochia,</em> or infirmaries, were attached to these guest-houses, where sick travelers could receive medical treatment. St. Benedict ordained that the monastic oratory should be what its name implied, a place exclusively reserved for public and private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. In the beginning it was a mere <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, only large enough to hold the religious, since externs were not admitted. The size of these <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> were gradually enlarged to meet the requirements of the liturgy. There was also usually an oratory, outside the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">monastic enclosure</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were admitted.

<p>The refectory was the common hall where the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> assembled for their meals. Strict silence was observed there, but during the meals one of the brethren read aloud to the community. The refectory was originally built on the plan of the ancient Roman <em>triclinium</em>, terminating in an <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>. The tables were ranged along three sides of the room near the walls, leaving the interior space for the movements of the servers. Near the door of the refectory was invariably to be found the lavatory, where the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> washed their hands before and after meals. The kitchen, was, for convenience, always situated near the refectory. In the larger <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> separate kitchens were provided for the community (where the brethren performed the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in weekly turns), the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, the sick, and the guests. The dormitory was the community bed-chamber. A lamp burned in it throughout the night. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> slept clothed, so as to be ready, as St. Benedict says, to rise without delay for the night Office. The normal arrangement, where the numbers permitted it, was for all to sleep in one dormitory, hence there were often very large; sometimes more than one was required. The practice, however, gradually came in of dividing the large dormitory into numerous small cubicles, one being allotted to each <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. The latrines were separated from the main buildings by a passage, and were always planned with the greatest regard to health and cleanliness, a copious supply of running water being used wherever possible.

<p>Although St. Benedict makes no specific mention of a <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>, nevertheless he does order <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to "come together presently after supper to read the 'Collations.'" No <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a> appears on the plan of the great <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/13349a.htm">St. Gall</a>, dating back to the ninth century; in the early days, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> must have served for the meetings of the community, either for instruction or to discuss the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. But convenience soon suggested a special place for these purposes, and there is mention of chapter-rooms in the Council of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aix-la-Chapelle</a> (817). The chapter-room was always on the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> level, on to which it opened. The <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>, though covered, were generally open to the weather, and were an adaptation of the old Roman <em>atrium</em>. Besides providing a means of communication between the various parts of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, they were both the dwelling-place and the workshop of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and thus the word <em><a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a></em> became a synonym for the monastic life. How the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> managed to live in these open galleries during the winter months, in cold climates, is a mystery; a room, called a "calefactory," heated by flues, or in which a fire was kept up, where the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> might retire occasionally to warm themselves, was provided in <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.

<p>On the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Continent</a> the practice in regard to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> differed somewhat from that prevailing in England. Not being as yet incorporated into the community, they were not permitted to dwell in the interior of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. They had their places in choir during the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, but they spent the rest of their time in the novitiate. A senior <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, called the novice-master, instructed them in the principles of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and "tried their spirits if they be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">St. Benedict's Rule</a> prescribed. This period of probation lasted a whole year. Abroad, the building set apart for the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> was provided with its own dormitory, kitchen, refectory, workroom, and occasionally even its own <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>; it was, in fact, a miniature <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> within a larger one.

<p>The infirmary was a special building set apart for the accommodation of the sick and infirm brethren, who there received the particular care and attention they needed, at the hands of those appointed to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. A herbal garden provided many of the remedies. When death had brought its reward, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were laid to rest in a cemetery within the monastic precincts. The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial</a> amongst the religious, a privilege highly esteemed, was also sometimes accorded <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, royal personages, and distinguished benefactors.

<p>No <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was complete without its cellars for the storing of provisions. There were, in addition, the granaries, barns, etc., all under the care of the cellarer, as also such buildings and outhouses as were used for agricultural purposes. Gardens and orchards provided such vegetables and fruit as were cultivated in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The work of the fields did not, however, occupy all the time of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Besides cultivating the arts, and transcribing <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, they plied many trades, such as tailoring, shoe-making, carpentering, etc., while others baked the bread for daily consumption. Most <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> had a mill for grinding their own corn. It will thus be seen that an Abbey, especially if it maintained a large community, was a little city, self-contained and self-sufficing, as St. Benedict wished it to be, to obviate as far as possible any necessity for the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to leave the enclosure. The enormous development of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">monastic life</a> brought in its train a similar development in the accommodation suitable for it. The monastic buildings, at first so primitive, grew in time till they presented a very imposing appearance; and the arts were requisitioned and ancient models of architecture copied, adapted, and modified. The Basilican plan, indigenous to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was, naturally, that first adopted. Its churches consisted of a <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, lighted by clerestory windows, and terminating in a semicircular sanctuary or <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>. As time went on, the round <a href="../cathen/01688a.htm">arch</a>, typical of Basilican and Romanesque architecture, gradually gave place to the pointed arch, peculiar to the new <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, which is defined as "perfected Romanesque." In England a tendency developed of making the sanctuary rectangular instead of apsidal. The Normans adopted this arrangement; and in their church-planning the <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">English</a> oblong type of <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> gradually took the place of the Romanesque and continental <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">Basilica</a> plan was abandoned for that of the Gothic, of a crossing or <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, separating <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> from chancel, the latter being extended to make room for the choir. The final evolution of the style peculiar to England is due to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, the characteristic of whose Abbeys was extreme simplicity and the absence of needless ornament; their renunciation of the world was evidenced in all that met the eye. Pinnacles, turrets, traceried windows, and <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> were, in their early days at least, proscribed. And during the twelfth century <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> influence predominated throughout Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> churches of this period, <a href="../cathen/06161a.htm">Fountains</a>, Kirkstall, Jervaulx, Netly, and <a href="../cathen/14736d.htm">Tintern</a>, have rectangular chancels. These and other twelfth century churches belong to what is known as the Transitional or Pointed Norman style. Then followed the greater elaboration of Early and Decorated English, as seen at <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a> and Worcester, or rebuilt Westminster, culminating in the splendours of the Perpendicular, or Tudor style, of which Henry VII's Chapel, at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a>, is so superb an example. Few <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">English</a> Abbeys of note, however, were of homogeneous architecture; in fact, the mixture of styles, though sometimes almost bewildering, adds to what is left of these stately piles a greater picturesqueness ever pleasing to <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">archaeologist</a> and <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">artist</a>.

<p>The routine of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> could be maintained and supervised only by the <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegation</a> of some of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> authority to various officials, who thus shared with him the burden of rule and administration, and the transaction of business--considerable and ever increasing in volume, where a large and important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was concerned. The rule was exercised in subordination to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> by the claustral prior and sub-prior; the administration, by officials termed <a href="../cathen/11183a.htm">obedientiaries</a> who possessed extensive powers in their own spheres. Their number varied in different houses; but the following were the ordinary officials, together with their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, most commonly named in old Customals: The cantor, or <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a>, regulated the <a href="../cathen/14140c.htm">singing</a> in the church service, and was assisted by the succentor or sub-cantor. He trained the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> to render the traditional <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">chant</a> properly. In some places he acted as master to the boys of the claustral <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. He was the librarian and archivist, and in this capacity, had charge of the precious tomes and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> preserved in a special aumbry or book-cupboard, and had to provide the choirbooks and those for reading in the refectory. He prepared and sent round the briefs, or mortuary-rolls, announcing the death of any of the brethren to other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. He was also one of the three official custodians of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> seal, holding one of the keys to the chest where it was kept. To the <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a> and his assistants was committed the care of the church fabric, together with its sacred plate and <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a>. He had to see to the cleaning and lighting of the church, its decking for great <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festivals</a>, and the vestments used by the sacred vestments. The cemetery was also under his charge. To his office pertained the lighting of the entire of the entire <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>: and thus he superintended the candle-making, and bought the necessary stores of wax, tallow, and cotton for wicks. He slept in the church, and took his meals near at hand, so that day and night the church was never left without a guardian. His chief assistants were a revestiarius, who saw to the vestments, the linen, and the hangings of the church, and was responsible for their being kept in repair, or replaced when worn out; and the treasurer, who was in special charge of the shrines, <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a>, <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, and other plate.

<p>The cellarer was the purveyor of all food-stuffs and drink for the use of the community. This entailed frequent absences, and hence exemption from much of the ordinary choir <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. He had charge of the hired servants, whom he alone could engage, dismiss, or punish. He superintended the serving up of the meals. To his office belonged the supplying of fuel, carriage of goods, repairs of the house, etc. He was aided by a sub-cellarer and, in the bakery, by a granatorius, or keeper of the grain, who saw to the grinding and quality of flour. The refectorian had charge of the refectory, or "fratry," keeping it clean, supplied with cloths, napkins, jugs, and dishes, and superintended the laying of the tables. To him, too, was assigned the care of the lavatory, and the providing it with towels and, if necessary, hot water. The office of the kitchener was one of great responsibility, for to him fell the portioning out of the food, and it was only great experience which could preserve the happy mean between waste and niggardliness. He had under him an emptor, or buyer, experienced in marketing. He had to keep a strict account of his expenditures and of the stores, presenting in books weekly to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> for examination. He presided over the entire kitchen department, seeing particularly that all the utensils were kept scrupulously clean. The discharge of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> entailed frequent exemption from choir. The weekly servers helped in the kitchen, under the kitchener's orders, and waited at table during the meals. The concluded their week's work on Saturday evenings by washing the feet of the brethren. The infirmarian had to tend the sick with affectionate sympathy, and, as far as might be necessary, was excused from regular <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. If a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he said Mass for the sick; if not, he got a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to do so. He always slept in the infirmary, even when there were no sick there, so as to be found on the spot in case of emergency. The curious practice of blood-letting, looked on as so salutary in ancient times, was carried out by the infirmarian. The chief <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the almoner was to distribute the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, in food and clothing, to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, with kindness and discretion; and; while ministering to their bodily wants, he was not to forget those of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also. He superintended the daily maundy or <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washing of the feet</a> of the poor selected for that purpose. Another of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> was to take charge of any school, other than the claustral school, connected with the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. To him also fell the task of seeing to the circulation of the mortuary-rolls.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval days</a> the hospitality extended to travelers by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> was of such constant occurrences that the guest-master required a full measure of tact, prudence, and discretion, as well as affability, since the reputation of the house was in his keeping. His first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> was to see that the guest-house always ready for the reception of visitors, whom he was to receive, as enjoined by the Rule, as he would <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, and during their stay to supply their wants, entertain them, conduct them to the church services, and generally to hold himself at their disposal. The chief <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the chamberlain of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> were concerned with the wardrobe of the brethren, repairing or renewing their worn-out garments, and preserving cast-off clothes for distribution to the poor by the almoner. He had also to superintend the laundry. As it belonged to him to provide cloth and other material for the clothing, he had to attend the neighbouring fairs to purchase his stock. On him, too, devolved the task of making preparation for the baths, feet-washing, and shaving of the brethren.

<p>The novice-master was of course one of the most important officials in every monastery. In church, in the refectory, in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, in the dormitory, he kept a watchful control over the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and spent the day teaching them and exercising them in the rules and traditional practices of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, encouraging and helping those who showed real signs of a monastic <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">vocation</a>. The weekly officials included, besides the servers already referred to, the reader in the refectory, who was enjoined to make careful preparation so as to avoid mistakes. Also, the antiphoner whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to read the invitatory at <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, intone the first <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphon</a> of the Psalms, the versicles and responsories, after the <a href="../cathen/09193a.htm">lessons</a>, and the capitulum, or little chapter, etc. The hebdomadarian, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the week, had to commence all the various <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical Hours</a>, give all the blessings that might be required, and sing the High Mass each day.

<p>The greater Abbeys in England were represented through their superiors in Parliament, in Convocations, and in Synod. Their superiors were regularly included in the Commissions of Peace, and in all things acted as, and were considered the equals of, their great <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> neighbours. The <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> bestowed on the poor by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, together with those furnished by law, by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, served to support them without recourse to the more recent poor-laws. The lot of the poor was lightened, and they knew that they could turn for help and sympathy to the religious houses. <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">Poverty</a> as witnessed in these days was impossible in all the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, spread over all the country, acted as merely stewards of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> property, and dispensed it, if lavishly, yet with discretion. The relations between the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and their tenants were uniformly kindly; the smaller cottagers were treated with much consideration, and if it became necessary to inflict fines, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> was tempered with mercy. The monastic manors were worked somewhat on the principle of a co-operative farm. If we may form a judgment on the whole of England from the "Durham Halmote Rolls," the conditions of village life left little to be desired. Provisions for watching over the public health were enforced, a guard kept over water supplies, stringent measures taken in regard to springs and wells, and the cleansing of ponds and milldams. A common mill ground the tenants' corn, and their bread was baked in a common oven. The relation of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to their peasant-tenants was rather that of rent-chargers than of absolute owners.
