<h1>Abbey and Congregation of Melk</h1>  

<p>(MOLCK, MELLICUM).

<p>Situated on an isolated rock commanding the Danube, Melk has been a noted place since the days of the Romans. A <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> settlement, Magalicha, replaced the Roman fort, and in its turn was destroyed by a Magyar invasion about 955, when it received the name Eisenburg. The Magyars, however, were driven out by Luitpold the Illustrious, first Margrave of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, who here fixed his capital and founded a church for secular canons. These having become lax, were replaced by twelve <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, whom Luitpold II brought from Lambach with Sijibold as their <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in 1089. Melk was much favoured by St. Luitpold III, and the new foundation rapidly grew and flourished, its corn <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> being so abundant that the folk-name for Melk was "at the full bushel". It became a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the shrine of St. Coloman, and was famed for its great <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Holy Cross. By the fifteenth century <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> observance at Melk had become relaxed, but in 1418, at the request of Albert V, Archduke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> sent the Ven. Nicholas of Magen with five other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> to begin a reform of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Melk, John of Flemming, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> resigned, and Nicholas, elected in his stead, soon so reformed the observance in accordance with the constitutions of <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> became a model for other houses in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> followed its example, among them Obenburg, <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, Mariazell, the <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/08701a.htm">Kremsm&uuml;nster</a>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14471b.htm">Tegernsee</a>. All these houses followed the same observance and styled themselves the Congregation of Melk. They in no way depended, however, on Melk, nor had they any general superior, soliciting visitors when needful from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The Abbey of Melk continued in its first fervour of reform, and several attempts were made from 1460 onwards to effect a more formal union. In 1470 seventeen <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of various neighbouring <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> met at Erfurt and decided to establish in their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the common observance and ceremonial of Melk. Nothing more definite occurred until Gaspar, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Melk, in 1618 invited the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> to meet at Melk and form a congregation. The negotiations continued until 1623, when the Abbots of Melk, Kremsm&uuml;nster, Garsten, the Scots' Abbey of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Altenburg, Gttweich and Mariazell signed the constitutions agreed upon for the new congregation. These were confirmed by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1625. In addition the congregation included the houses of Lambach, Monsee, Leittenstaden and Kleinck. It was governed by a superior general, elected every two years, who acted as visitor of all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the congregation. Each province also had its own visitor. In 1630 there was an attempt to form a united congregation of all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the empire, but the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> invasion frustrated this project, though many of the German <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> thenceforth observed the constitutions of Melk. In the fourteenth century Melk, by permission of Duke Frederic I, had been fortified, and was thus able to resist successive sieges by <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias Corvinus</a>, by the revolted peasantry, by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> States of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, though on each occasion the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> suffered. Great losses, too, were sustained at the hands of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> troops. In 1889 the Abbey of Melk was included by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in the Austrian <a href="../cathen/07681a.htm">Congregation of the Immaculate Conception</a>. In 1905 the congregation numbered 85, of whom 75 were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Joseph Charles (b. 1824, appointed 1875), exercises <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over 29 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 45,145 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.
