<h1>Abbey and Diocese of Bobbio</h1>  

<p>The diocese (<em>Ebovium</em>, or <em>Bobium</em>; <em>Dioecesis Eboviensis</em>, or <em>Bobiensis</em>), which is suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Archiepiscopal See of Genoa</a>, is coterminous with the civil district of Bobbio. This district is situated in the Province of Pavia and contains, besides Bobbio, its chief town, only two small villages and eighteen communes. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was suppressed from 1803 to 1817, during which time it was annexed to <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, then to Casala. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> re-established it in 1818. Under Bishop Antonio Gianelli a congregation of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was formed in 1839 under the title of Oblates of <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a>. They devote themselves especially to hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, as well as to spreading good literature among the people. Bobbio also possesses a Congregation of Daughters of Mary, popularly known as <em>Gianelliane.</em>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The origin of the See of Bobbio, indeed of the town itself, is due to the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> here by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> saint, Columban, in 614. The Lombards, with other savage tribes, had invaded northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> under their leader Alboin in 568. A half-Arian, half-heathen horde, wherever they passed all the horrors of wanton destruction and cruelty marked their track. But at length the new barbarian ruler Agilulph, became less hostile and by degrees even not unfavorably disposed towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Queen Theodelinda, whom he married in 590, was a fervent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; she had wonderful influence over her consort, and at last he was converted by the preaching of Columban. From the day of his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, Agilulph displayed great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion of his subjects, and for this purpose gave St. Columban a ruined church and devastated district known as Ebovium, which, before the Lombards seized it, had formed part of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony of St. Peter</a>. Columban had set his heart on this secluded place, for while intent on instructing the Lombards he chose solitude for his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and himself. By the side of this little church, which was dedicated to St. Peter, soon arose the walls of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Here the nucleus of what was to be the most celebrated <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was formed by the Mss. which Columban had brought from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and the treatises of which he himself was the author.

<p>The sainted founder of Bobbio was laid to rest (23 November, 615), but his <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> passed into worthy hands. The names of <a href="../cathen/02060a.htm">St. Attala</a> (627) and <a href="../cathen/02524a.htm">St. Bertulf</a> (640) will live forever in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. Both were conspicuous for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and learning, and both inherited Columban's apostolic spirit. It was indeed sorely needed, for a reaction towards <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> set in, which became formidable under the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> king, Rotharis (636-652). Arioald, the immediate predecessor of Rotharis, who <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, had before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> caused St. Bladulf, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Bobbio, to be assassinated, because Bladulf would not salute him, as being an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>. It is said that Attala restored Bladulf to life and delivered Arioald from a diabolical possession, the punishment of his crime; and that this two-fold <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> led to Arioald's conversion. In 628, when <a href="../cathen/02524a.htm">St. Bertulf</a> made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Honorius I exempted Bobbio from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, thus making the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Under the next <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Bobolen, the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a> was introduced. At first its observance was optional, but in e course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> it superseded the more austere rule hitherto in use, and Bobbio joined the Congregation of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. In 643, at the request of Rotharis and Queen Gundelberga, Pope Theodore I granted to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bobbio the use of the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> and other pontificals. It has even been asserted that Bobbio had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, named Peter Aldus, as early as the seventh century, but according to the best authorities (<a href="../cathen/15119b.htm">Ughelli</a>, <a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a>, and others), the See of Bobbio was not founded till four centuries later, although recent investigation has shown that the name of its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> really was Peter Aldus (Savio, 158).

<p>From the seventh century on, in the midst of widespread turmoil and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, Bobbio remained a home of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and culture. Through the efforts of St. Columban's disciples, increasing numbers of the Lombards were received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But during the first half of the seventh century, the large tract of country lying between <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> and <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, was in a very irreligious and disturbed state; and even <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> was not unknown. In fact not until the reign of the usurper Grimoald (663-673), himself a convert, was the bulk of the nation brought into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But from that time <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> disappeared in the West. The historians of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> regard as one of its chief glories the prominent part which it took in the final contest with this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Theodelinda's nephew, the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Arribert (653--663), restored all the lands of Bobbio which belonged by right to the Prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Arribert II also gladly confirmed this restitution to <a href="../cathen/08423b.htm">John VII</a> in 707. The unruly Lombards soon dispossessed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but in 756 <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> was compelled by Pepin to give up the lands. In 774 <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> made liberal grants to the Abbey. In 1153 <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> confirmed by two charters various <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and possessions. Thus it came to pass that the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were for centuries entrusted with a large administration of temporals.

<p>The fame of Bobbio reached the shores of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and the memory of Columban was dear to the hearts of his countrymen. Bobolen's successor was <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a> who had resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in order to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Bobbio; St. Cummian who did the same died in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> about 730 (Holder-Egger in "Mon. Germ. Hist."); and the learned St. Dungal (d. after 827) bequeathed to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> his valuable <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, consisting of some seventy volumes, among which was the famous "Antiphonary of Bangor". A tenth-century catalogue, published by Muratori, shows that at that period every branch of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, divine and human, was represented in this <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. Many of the books have been lost, the rest have long since been dispersed and are still reckoned among the chief treasures of the later collections which possess them. In 1616 <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal Federigo Borromeo</a> took for the <a href="../cathen/01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> eighty-six volumes, including the famous "Bobbio Missal", written about 911, the Antiphonary of Bangor", and the palimpsests of <a href="../cathen/15120c.htm">Ulfila's</a> Gothic version of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. Twenty-six volumes were given, in 1618, to <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> for the Vatican Library. Many others were sent to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, where, besides those in the Royal Archives, there were seventy-one in the University Library until the disastrous fire of 26 January, 1904. As scholars of later ages have owed a great deal to the Bobbio <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, so, too, did those of the tenth century. Gerard of Aurillac, for example, who was afterwards Pope Sylvester II, became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bobbio in 982; and with the aid of the numerous ancient treatises which he found there he composed his celebrated work on geometry. And indeed it appears that at a time when Greek was almost unknown in western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Bobbio read <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and Demosthenes in the original tongue.

<p>In the year 1014, the Emperor <a href="../cathen/07227a.htm">Henry II</a>, on the occasion of his own <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, obtained from <a href="../cathen/02428e.htm">Benedict VIII</a> the erection of Bobbio as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Peter Aldus, its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, had been <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bobbio since 999, and his episcopal successors for a long time lived in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, where many of them had been <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/15119b.htm">Ughelli</a> and others, Bobbio was made a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> in 1133; but Savio finds this subordination mentioned for the first time in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 19 April, 1161. From time to time disputes arose between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and in 1199 <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> issued two <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, restoring the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in spirituals and temporals, and empowering the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to depose an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> if within a certain time he did not obey.

<p>Bobbio's greatest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been <ul><li>Blessed Albert (1184), who was translated to the Patriarchal See of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> at Acre in 1214; <li>the learned canonist Giovanni de Mondani (1477-82), whose remains were found incorrupt in 1614; and <li>Venerable Antonio Gianelli (1838-46), whose cause has been introduced.</ul> St. Columban's <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and church were taken from the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> by the French soldiers in 1803; what remains of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> is now used as a municipal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and the church, where the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Sts. Columban, Attala, Bertulf, Cummian, and others repose, is now a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, served by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The altars and the sarcophagi in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> present beautiful specimens of the interlaced ornamentation which is characteristic of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> art. In the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Bobbio there is a beautiful tabernacle in the <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> style.
