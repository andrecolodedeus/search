<h1>Abbey and Order of Grandmont</h1>  

<p>Abbey and Order in the department of Hte-Vienne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the foundation of the order is very uncertain. The traditional story involves serious chronological difficulties, and is based on a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> now shown to be a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> (see Mart&egrave;ne and Durand, Ampl. Coll., VI, Praef.). The founder, St. Stephen, is said to have settled in the valley of Muret near Limoges in 1076, but Mart&egrave;ne considers that the origin of the order cannot be placed earlier than about 1100. The Order of Grandmont has been claimed by both <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> as a branch of their respective institutes, although the Grandmontines always maintained that they formed a distinct order. Mart&egrave;ne considers that St. Stephen modelled his institute upon the life of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>. The so-called "Rule of St. Stephen" was compiled at the request of the fourth prior, Etienne de Liciac, by Hugh of Lacerta, and embodies the customs of Grandmont some 20 or 30 years after St. Stephen's death. The founder himself left no authentic writings. His maxim was "There is no rule save the Gospel of Christ"; as this was the basis of all rules, to practise its morality was to fulfil all the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a good religious. The early Grandmontines were noted for their extreme austerity. Poverty was most strictly observed; the rule forbade the possession of lands, cattle, revenue, or impropriate churches. Begging was only permitted when there was no food in the house, and even then the local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was first to be informed of their state. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of silence was also very severe, as were the rules of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and abstinence.

<p>After the founder's death in 1124 his disciples migrated to the neighbouring rocky <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Grandmont, owing to a dispute about the ownership of Muret. Under Etienne de Liciac the order spread rapidly, and in 1170 numbered sixty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, mostly in Aquitaine, Anjou, and Normandy. Under his successor, Bernard de Boschiac, eighty new foundations were made, and the "bons hommes" were to be found in nearly every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The influence of the Grandmontines reached its height in the twelfth century. Their holy austerity roused the admiration of all beholders, and the kings of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> vied with one another in bestowing favours upon them. Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> bad the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> rebuilt, and St. Louis erected a Grandmontine house at Vincennes. The golden age of Grandmont however lasted only some sixty years after the founder's death. From that time onwards the history of the order is an almost uninterrupted series of disputes. Even in the twelfth century the ill-defined position of the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> caused troubles. They were far more numerous than the choir-monks, and were given entire control of all temporalities in order that the latter might be entirely free to carry on their spiritual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Gradual relaxation of the rules of poverty led to great possessions, and thus increased the importance of the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, who now claimed equality with the choir-monks. This led to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> scenes. In 1185, the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> at Grandmont rose in open revolt, expelled Prior Guillaume de Trahinac with 200 of the religious, and set up an intruder. The political situation embittered these dissensions, the order being divided into two parties, French and English. Successive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> tried to restore peace, but in vain. In 1219 the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Grandmont and forty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were again expelled by the rebellious <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. In 1244 the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal delegates</a> advised a union of the order with the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> as a means of ending the disputes. This threat and the expulsion of a large number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> produced a certain degree of peace. Numbers, however, declined; about 1150, the order bed over 1200 members, but towards the beginning of the fourteenth century only 800. Moreover, a relaxation of the rule (1224) led finally to the cessation of all observance.

<p>In 1317 <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, sometimes said to have been a Grandmontine <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exigente debito" to save the order from complete destruction. Its organization was altered and certain mitigations were approved. The number of houses was reduced from 149 to 39. The <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Grandmont was made an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and the superiors of the dependent houses, who had hitherto been known as "Correctors", were for the future to bear the title of Prior. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Grandmont was to be elected by his own community, and not, as before, by the deputies of the whole order. A general chapter, to be attended by the prior and one <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from each dependent house, was to be held annually. These vigorous measures brought about a slight recovery, but, in spite of the vigilance of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the good administration of the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, the improvement was of short duration. The order suffered severely during the Hundred Years War. From 1471 till 1579 Grandmont was held by commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>; shortly after the latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> there were only eight <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> seised the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> on one occasion, but were expelled by Abbot Rigaud de Lavaur in 1604. In 1643 Abbot Georges Barny (1635-1654) held a general chapter, the first for 134 years, at which Dom Charles Fr&eacute;mon was authorised to found the Strict Observance of the Order of Grandmont. This new branch, which remained under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, was conspicuous for the primitive austerity of its observance, but never numbered more than eight houses. By the beginning of the eighteenth century the two Observances together numbered only about 150 members, but the quarries were as frequent and as bitter as ever. Grandmont was one of the first victims of the Commission des R&eacute;guliers. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> of the Strict Observance were dispersed in 1780, but the struggle for existence was prolonged till 1787, when the last two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were expelled from the mother-house. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was finally destroyed at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and nothing but a few fragments of wall now remains.

<p>Grandmont never produced any writers of importance. Apart from a number of lives of St. Stephen, the most important work issuing from Grandmont was G&eacute;rard Ithier's treatise "De institutione novitiorum" &#151; a favourite spiritual work in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, usually but <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> attributed to <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>. The original habit of Grandmont was a coarse tunic with <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> and hood, brown in the early days but changed later to black. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> gradually laid aside <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> and hood in favour of <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> and <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a>. The original habit was resumed by the Strict Observance. The founder had expressly forbidden the reception into the order of houses of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, nevertheless four small <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunneries</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Diocese of Limoges</a> were admitted. Outside <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the order only possessed five houses, two in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and three in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. These latter, situated at Alberbury, Creswell, and Grosmont, never attained any importance and were occupied by a very small number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.
