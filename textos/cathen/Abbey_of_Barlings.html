<h1>Abbey of Barlings</h1>  

<p>Located about six miles E.N.E. of Lincoln, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, founded in 1154 in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> by Ralph de Haye who had given some lands to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Newhouse (also in Lincolnshire, the first abbey of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Order erected in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, founded in 1143) with the request to send a colony of <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">White Canons</a> to Barlings. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was afterwards removed to Oxeney, another locality in the same township, where it was dissolved by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in 1537. Much information concerning the Abbey of Barlings, as well as concerning other <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, may be derived from Bishop Redman's "Register of Visitations", preserved in the Bodleian Library at <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>, and lately published in three volumes by Abbot Gasquet under the title of "Collectanea Anglo-Premonstratensia". This register contains various documents, lists of <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">White Canons</a> in each <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, notes and remarks made at the time of each visitation, during a period of about thirty-five years that Redman was visitor of all the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for the Abbot-General of the Order of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;. Richard Redman was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Abbey of Shap in Westmoreland when he became visitor, and he acted in the same capacity when he successively became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a> in 1472, of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a> in 1495, and of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> in 1501. He died 24 August, 1505.

<p>This register records no fewer than nine visitations of Barlings Abbey made by Redman. The various lists found therein give the names of about eighteen canons at each visitation. The names of nineteen <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> are known; the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was called Adam (1154), the last Matthew Mackarel (1532-37) who is said to have been one of the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/12084b.htm">Pilgrimage of Grace</a> in Lincolnshire. The supposed complicity of Abbot Mackarel, like that of other heads of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, gave <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> the opportunity of laying hands upon the Abbey of Barlings and of placing it under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">attainder</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, 300 feet in length, was defaced, the lead torn from the roofs, and melted down under the special direction of Cromwell. Abbot Mackarel, some of his religious, and many of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were taken to Lincoln, and some of these were afterwards sent to the Tower in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Those in Lincoln, among whom there were four canons of Barlings, were tried 6 March, 1537, and ordered for immediate execution. Towards the end of March, Abbot Matthew Mackarel, one of his canons and some others were tried in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> before Chancellor Oudeley, found guilty, and condemned to be hanged and quartered. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">dissolution</a> the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and its possessions were granted to Charles, Duke of Suffolk. An arch and part of a wall are the only remains. The Right Rev. Martin Geudens, of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> Priory, <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, was named Titular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Barlings, 7 May, 1898, and blessed 17 September, of the same year.
