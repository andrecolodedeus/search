<h1>Abbey of Benedictbeurn</h1>  

<p>Situated in the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Alps, about thirty miles south of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. It was formerly in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, but some writers, including <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, have wrongly described it as having been in that of Freising. The name has been variously spelt as Beuren, Beuern, Buron, Beweren, Baiern, Bayrn, etc., but that given above is the officially accepted spelling at the present time. Tradition, as well as <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> dating as far back as the tenth century, ascribe its foundation in the year 740, to three brothers of noble birth, named Lanfrid, Wulfram, and Eliland, acting under the influence of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, who was then preaching the Faith in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The three founders, each in turn, ruled the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which in 955 (or 973) according to some authorities) was destroyed by the Huns, who then ravaged the country. Restored in 969 by Wolfold, a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, it continued as a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or canons, until 1031. Through the influence of the <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine rule</a> was revived there in 1031 by Abbot Ellinger and eleven <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from the neighbouring Abbey of Tegernsee.

<p>Under the next <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Gothelm, the famous <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was established. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> also became a great place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> and the scene of many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, by reason of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Anastasia which were brought thither in 1053. Throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it continued to flourish as a home of learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Many privileges were granted by different <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and several of the emperors <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> it with their favour and their visits. The Abbots Ortolph II (1271-84) and Henry III (1284-89) were made Princes of the Empire by Rudolph of Hapsburg. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was four times burnt down, viz: in 1248, 1377, 1378, and 1490, and as often rebuilt. In 1611 its numbers were depleted by a plague which carried off many of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and it also suffered during the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> invasion under Gustavus Adolphus and the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> in the seventeenth century. In 1803 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was suppressed by the Government and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, thirty-four in number, dispersed. The conventual buildings became successively a barracks, a military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, and a stud-house. In 1901 Freiherr von Kramer-Klett, the restorer of several <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, offered five and one-half million marks for the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but was met by a demand for twelve millions, which he refused.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and archives contained many priceless <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and charters. <a href="../cathen/14463c.htm">Ziegelbauer</a> (Hist. Lit. Ord. S.B., I, 543) printed a catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1250, in which more than one hundred and fifty books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are enumerated. <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, who visited the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 1683, and Bernard Pez, librarian of <a href="../cathen/10167a.htm">Melk</a>, who was there in 1717, have both left on record their testimony as to the great value of the <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> there preserved. At the suppression the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> comprised 40,000 volumes. A number of these were incorporated with the Court Library and the remainder left to be disposed of by the subsequent occupants of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>.

<p>Amongst the illustrious men produced by Benedictbeurn the following deserve mention: Gothelm, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> 1032-62; founded the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in 1033. Gotschalk, who translated the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Anastasia to Beurn in 1053; the first historian of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> ("Breviarium Gotschalki" in Mon. Germ. Hist., IX, 221). Dom Simon Speer, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; tortured and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the Swedes for refusing to surrender the goods of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, 1632. Magnus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> 1707-40; resuscitated the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, 1711. Dom Carolus Meichelbeck, "the Livy of Bavaria", b. 1669; took the habit, 1687 and was librarian and archivist from 1696 till his death in 1734. He taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and wrote various historical works, including the "History of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Freising", the "Chronicon Benedicto-Buranum", and the "Annals of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Congregation".
