<h1>Abbey of Clairvaux</h1>  

<p>The third daughter of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> and mother in the fourth line of numerous and celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, founded in 1115 by <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, in a deep valley upon the bank of the Aube, and known as the <em>Vall&eacute;e d'Absinthe</em> (Valley of Wormwood or Bitterness), then in the <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Diocese of Langres</a>, today in that of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> in Champagne, Department of the Aube, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Hughes I, Count of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, donated this valley to the colony of <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>. In a short time it became the <em>Clara Vallis</em>, or Clairvaux, as the new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> is already called in a charter of 1116. After a trying and laborious beginning, Clairvaux, under the direction of St. Bernard, developed rapidly. His renown attracted such large numbers of <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> that even in his lifetime sixty-eight <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded from it in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. In 1116 twelve <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Clairvaux installed themselves at Trois-Fontaines in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, under the guidance of Roger, one of the first converts St. Bernard by his eloquence had attracted from the celebrated <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Stephen of Vitry. In 1119 Bernard sent another colony to found Fontenay in the <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Diocese of Autun</a>, today in that of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>. Then were founded Foigny in the Diocese of Noyon; Cherlieu in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>; Longpont in the <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Diocese of Soissons</a>; Vauclair in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Laon; La Grace-Dieu in the Diocese of Saintes; Buzay in the <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Diocese of Nantes</a>; Bonmont in the Diocese of Geneva (Switzerland); Hautecombe in the Diocese of Geneva, today in that of <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>; Chiaravalle in the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Diocese of Milan</a>; Moreruela in the <a href="../cathen/15747c.htm">Diocese of Zamora</a> (Spain); Rievaulx and <a href="../cathen/06161a.htm">Fountains</a> in the Diocese of York (England). Towards 1153 it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to extend the limits of Clairvaux and erect other claustral buildings. The new buildings were quickly constructed. "The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>," says a witness, "arose from the soil as though it was animated with a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and capable of self-motion". It was 347 feet long and 114 feet wide, with a triple <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> in eleven divisions. The <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> was 177 feet and contained eight square altars facing one another. No <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> or artistic ornament relieved the severity of the style either of the interior or of the exterior.

<p>Illustrious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were buried at Clairvaux in the livery of the poor of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, among them Henry of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, brother of King Louis VII; Alexander of Cologne, who was later one of the successors of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a>; Henry Murdach who became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Vauclair and later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>; Philip, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, etc. Religious even of the other orders, flocked there. The Congregation of Savigny, founded in 1105 by Blessed Vital of Mortagne, with seventeen houses, became affiliated to Clairvaux in 1147, as also that of Obazine, founded by St. Stephen of Durfort in 1142. Affonso I, King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, in 1143 made his kingdom a vassal of the Abbey of Clairvaux and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> his successors to pay to it every year, on the <a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">feast of the Annunciation</a>, fifty marabitains of gold. In 1148, in memory of the victory over the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> which he had gained the preceding year through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of St. Bernard, he founded the Abbey of Alcoba&ccedil;a, whose <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were always Grand Almoners of the Kings of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. St. Bernard at his death, in 1153, left at Clairvaux seven hundred religious.

<p>After two centuries of fervour, Clairvaux did not escape the evils of the decadence. But it was one of the first to reform. In 1615, Denis Largentier, who was its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, converted while in meditation at the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Bernard, restored the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, abstinences and other practices of the order, and re-established in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the regularity and the fervour of its first days. Clairvaux became the principal seat of the strict Observance. (See <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">CISTERCIANS</a>.) At the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> (1790) Clairvaux had only 26 professed religious, counting the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Dom Louis-Marie Rocourt, 10 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, and 10 affiliated pensioners of the house; 19 of the religious and all the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> were secularized. After the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> retired to Bar-sur-Aube, where he died in obscurity, the fifty-first and last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clairvaux, 6 April, 1824. In 1790 Clairvaux had in affiliation in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> ninety-two houses with 864 religious. This <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> had given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> one <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a>, fifteen <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and a great number of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Clairvaux became the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the State, and during the Restoration its buildings were converted into a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.
