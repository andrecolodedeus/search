<h1>Abbey of Cornillon</h1>  

<p>Founded by Albero, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, in 1124, three years after St. Norbert had formed the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian Order</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was intended for <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute; who had been sent from the Abbey of Floreffe near Namur; it stood on the right bank of the Meuse on an elevation called Mont Cornillon which overlooked the city of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. In the early years of the order all <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were double <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, that is to say, the canons lived on one side of the church and the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, who had charge of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, dwelt on the other side. Where an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> stood on an elevation, as was the case at Cornillon, both the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> were erected at the foot of the hill. <a href="../cathen/08555a.htm">St. Juliana</a> of Cornillon (born 1193; died 1258), whose name is connected with the institution of the feast of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> was a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Cornillon was Blessed Lucas, one of St. Norbert's disciples, a learned and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religious, some of whose writings have been published in the "Bibliotheca Magna Patrum", and also by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, wishing to build a fortress on the heights of Cornillon, gave in 1288, in exchange to the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> canons, another Place in his episcopal city where the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, now called Beaurepart (Bellus Reditus), stood until it was suppressed by the French Republic in 1796. All the religious refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to the Republic; some were exiled and one was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was declared to be of public utility, consequently it was not sold; for a time it served as an arsenal and for other government purposes, but by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 11 June, 1809, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> residence and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Where the Abbey of Mont Cornillon originally stood the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> have erected a home for old people, and close to the home, but below, at the foot of the hill, the former <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> is now inhabited by <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Part of the church of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> has remained as it was when <a href="../cathen/08555a.htm">St. Juliana</a> of Cornillon <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in it and was favoured with visions which led to the institution of the feast of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>.
