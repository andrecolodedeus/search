<h1>Abbey of Croyland</h1>  

<p>(Or Crowland.)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> in Lincolnshire, sixteen miles from Stamford and thirteen from <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>. It was founded in memory of <a href="../cathen/07092a.htm">St. Guthlac</a>, early in the eighth century, by Ethelbald, King of Mercia, but was entirely destroyed and the community slaughtered by the Danes in 866. Refounded in the reign of King Edred, it was again destroyed by fire in 1091, but rebuilt about twenty years later by Abbot Joffrid. In 1170 the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and church was once more burnt down and once more rebuilt, under Abbot Edward. From this time the history of Croyland was one of growing and almost unbroken prosperity down to the time of the Dissolution. Richly endowed by royal and noble visitors to the shrine of <a href="../cathen/07092a.htm">St. Guthlac</a>, it became one of the most opulent of East Anglian <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>; and owning to its isolated position in the heart of the fen country, its security and peace were comparatively undisturbed during the great civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and other national troubles. The first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (in Ethelbald's reign) is said to have been Kenulph, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/05648a.htm">Evesham</a>; and one of the most notable was Ingulphus, who ruled from 1075 to 1109, and whose pseudo-chronicle was long considered the chief authority for the history of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, though it is now acknowledged to be a compilation of the fifteenth century. At the time of the Dissolution the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was John Welles, or Bridges, who with his twenty-seven <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> subscribed to the Royal Supremacy in 1534, and five years later surrendered his house to the king. The revenue of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at this time has been variously estimated at 1083 and 1217 pounds. The site and buildings were granted in Edward VI's reign to Edward Lord Clinton, and afterwards came into the possession of the Hunter <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The remains of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> were fortified by the Royalists in 1643, and besieged and taken by Cromwell in May of that year. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church comprised a <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of nine bays with <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, 183 feet long by 87 wide, an apsidal choir of five bays 90 feet long, a central tower and detached <a href="../cathen/02394d.htm">bell-tower</a> at the east end. The existing remains consist of the north aisle, still used (as it was from the earliest times) as the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church; the splendid west front, the lower (twelfth century) and the upper part (fourteenth century) elaborately decorated with arcading and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, it is thought in imitation of Wells <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; and a few piers and arches of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>. Much careful restoration and repair has been carried out since 1860, under Sir Gilbert Scott, Mr. J.L. Pearson, and other eminent architects.
