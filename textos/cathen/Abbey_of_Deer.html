<h1>Abbey of Deer</h1>  

<p>A once famous Scotch <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. According to the Celtic legend St. Columcille, his disciple Drostan, and others, went from <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Hy (Iona)</a> into Buchan and established an important missionary centre at Deer on the banks of the Ugie on lands given him by the <em>mormaer</em> or chief of the district whose son he had by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> freed of a dangerous illness. This happened probably in the last quarter of the sixth century. Columcille soon after continued his missionary journeys and left Drostan as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> at Deer. Drostan died here about 606. The legend receives confirmation from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Aberdour <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/05161a.htm">St. Drostan</a> as patron. In later years the Normans had little sympathy with the Celtic institutions, so we find the Earl of Buchan in 1219 founding the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> abbey of New Deer about two miles westward of Columcille's foundation, granting to the new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> a portion of the lands of Old Deer, the rest going to the maintenance of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> church. In 1551 the son of the Earl Marischal succeeded his uncle Robert Keith as titular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Deer holding the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> lands in <em>commendam</em>. The flourishing <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> soon fell a prey to the Scottish <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. Among its treasures is the venerable document known as the "Book of Deer". This is one of the oldest monuments of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> literature, and was ably edited in 1869 for the Spalding Club by its secretary, Dr. John Stuart. It had become known to scholars in 1858 when it was found in the <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">University of Cambridge</a>. It was then also discovered that the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> had come into its possession in 1715 among the books of Dr. John Moore, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, which had been purchased by George I and presented by him to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; how Bishop Moore had obtained it is not known. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is a small, nearly square octavo numbering eighty-six folios of parchment, written on both sides of the leaf in a dark brown ink, in a hand wonderfully clear and legible. The pages had been ruled with a sharp pointed instrument and the letters had been placed under the lines, not on them. It contains the first six chapters of the Gospel of St. Matthew, a part of the fifth chapter of St. Mark, the entire Gospel of St. John, a part of the office for visiting the sick and the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>. The text is from the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> with some peculiarities common to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Bible editions, and is written in the well-known minuscule lettering of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> scribes; the initial letters were greatly enlarged and ornamented with patches of colour in dragonesque forms, and the pages have ornamental borders. There are also full portraits of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>. The Book then contains entries in the Gaelic tongue, the most important being that giving an account of the foundation of the Abbey of Deer. The author was probably a member of that community and lived perhaps in the eighth century. He gives no clue to his identity, but signs himself a poor wretch and asks for a blessing. The last document in the Book is a Latin charter from the great and good <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a>.
