<h1>Abbey of Dissentis</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the Canton Grisons in eastern <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, dedicated to Our Lady of Mercy. Tradition ascribes its foundation to Sts. Placid and Sigebert, in the year 614, but <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> places the date two years earlier. The history of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> has been somewhat chequered, but it has at times risen to positions of great importance and influence. It was destroyed by the Avars in 670, when its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and thirty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, but was rebuilt by <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> and Abbot Pirminius in 711. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> visited the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> on his return journey from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 800 and bestowed upon it many benefactions. Abbot Udalric I (1031-1055) was the first of its superiors to be made a prince of the empire, which dignity was subsequently held by several other of its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>; many of them also became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. In 1581 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by a visit from <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>. After enjoying independence for a thousand years it was incorporated into the newly formed <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Congregation in 1617, since which date it has, in common with the other five <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, been subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the president of that Congregation. In 1799 it was burned and plundered by the soldiers of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> army, when amongst other valuable treasures, a seventh century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> chronicle of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> perished. The printing press that had been set up in 1729 was also destroyed at the same time, but much of the melted type and other metal was saved and from it were made the pipes of the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> of St. Martin's church at Dissentis, which is still in use. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was rebuilt by Abbot Anselm Huonder, the last of its superiors to enjoy the rank and title of Prince of the Empire. During the nineteenth century the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> suffered greatly from misfortunes of various kinds, and so great was the relaxation of discipline in consequence that its recovery was almost despaired of. Abbot Paul Birker came from his abbey of St. Boniface at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> to assist in restoring regular observance, but so little success attended his efforts that he left Dissentis in 1861 and returned to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> as a simple <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> has, however, survived those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> times and is in a satisfactory and flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. Dom Benedict Prevost, the eightieth who has ruled over its fortunes, was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in 1908 of a community of between thirty and forty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who, among their other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, served five public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> and conducted successfully a gymnasium of nearly a hundred boys.
