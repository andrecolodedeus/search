<h1>Abbey of Dunfermline</h1>  

<p>In the south-west of Fife, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. Founded by King Malcolm Canmore and his queen, Margaret, about 1070, it was richly endowed by him and his sons, and remodelled as a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by his successor, David I, who brought an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and twelve <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> buildings, which were of such extent and splendour that three sovereigns and their retinues might (says <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a>) have been lodged there together, were burned down by Edward I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1304, but were afterwards restored. The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Malcolm and Margaret are still to be seen within the ruined walls of the Lady <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and were repaired and enclosed by order of Queen Victoria. Dunfermline Abbey was one of the richest Scottish houses, owning almost all Western Fife, as well as <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in other counties. It possessed, within its own domains, civil and criminal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> equal to that of the Crown. The church succeeded <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> as the burial-place of kings, and was thus the <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. Besides Malcolm and Margaret, David I and Robert Bruce, with his queen and daughter, were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> there. After the <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">Dissolution</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> passed through the hands of the Pitcairn <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, Lord Gray, and Seton Earl of Dunfermline, to the Marquises of Tweeddale. The splendid church was destroyed in 1560 by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, all but the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, which they refitted for <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> worship. It is a fine example of Anglo-Norman <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architecture</a>, with a beautiful western doorway. The remains of the church and palace are now Crown <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.
