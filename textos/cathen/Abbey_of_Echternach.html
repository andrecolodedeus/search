<h1>Abbey of Echternach</h1>  

<p>(Also EPTERNACH, <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> EPTERNACENSIS).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the town of that name, in the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg and the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Diocese of Trier</a>. It was founded in 698 by <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Ripon, who became the Apostle of Friesland and first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. Although a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he ruled the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> until his death in 739. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> stood near Trier on land given him for the purpose by St. Irmine, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Oeren and daughter of Dagobert II. It had many royal and other benefactors, including Pepin and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who conferred upon it great privileges. In 859 the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were displaced by secular canons, as was so often the case with the early <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but in 971 Emperor Otho I restored the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> life there, bringing forty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> thither from the great Abbey of St. Maximin at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, one of whom, Ravanger by name, was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became very celebrated and was, during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, one of the most important in Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. It continued to flourish until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, when it was suppressed, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> dispersed. The buildings put up by <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a> were burnt down in 1017, and a new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was then erected. The church was Romanesque in style, but <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> additions and alterations were made in the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. In 1797 it was sold and became a pottery manufactory, but in 1861 it was reacquired by the townspeople, through whose generosity and devotion it was restored and made a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. The reconsecration took place with great solemnity in 1868, and since that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the work of restoration and decoration has continued steadily. It is popularly called "the cathedral", though not the seat of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The conventual buildings, originally erected in 1017-31, have been frequently rebuilt and added to, and they were entirely modernized in 1732. At the suppression they became State <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and have for many years served as barracks. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was noted for a number of precious <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> which it contained; some of them are now in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.
<h2>The dancing procession</h2>

<p>The Abbey of Echternach owes much of its fame, especially in modern times, to the curious "dancing procession" which takes place annually on Whit Tuesday, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>. The cult of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> may be traced back almost to the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death, and the stream of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church had never ceased. The Emperors Lothair I, Conrad, and Maxmilian may be numbered amongst them. The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> stands before the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> and has been recently entirely renewed. On it is a recumbent effigy of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and amongst other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> preserved there are a <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> said to have been used by him. The origin of the procession cannot be stated with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Authentic documents of the fifteenth century speak of it as a regular and recognized custom at that time, but for earlier evidence there is only tradition to depend upon. The legend is that in 1347, when a pestilence raged amongst the cattle of the neighbourhood, the symptoms of which were a kind of trembling or nervous shaking followed by speedy death, the people thought that by imitating these symptoms, more or less, whilst imploring the intercession of <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> might be stayed. The desired result was obtained, and so the dancing procession to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> became an annual <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Nowadays it is made an act of expiation and penance on behalf of afflicted relations and especially in order to avert epilepsy, St. Vitus's dance, convulsions, and all nervous diseases. The function commences at nine o'clock in the morning at the bridge over the Sure, with a sermon by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (formerly the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>); after this the procession moves toward the basilica, through the chief streets of the town, a distance of about 1.5 kilometres. Three steps forward are taken, then two back, so that five steps are required in order to advance one pace. The results is that it is well after midday before the last of the dancers has reached the church. They go four or five abreast, holding each other by the hand or arm. Many bands accompany them, playing a traditional melody which has been handed down for centuries. A large number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious also accompany the procession and not infrequently there are several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as well. On arrival at the church, the dance is continued around the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>, when <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> are recited, and the whole concludes with Benediction of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. Though curious and even somewhat ludicrous, the people perform it in all seriousness and as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> act of devotion. It usually attracts to Echternach a great concourse of tourists as well as <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and as many as ten thousand people generally take part in it. The procession took place annually without intermission until 1777. Then, on account of some abuses that had crept in, the music and dancing were forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and in 1786 <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> abolished the procession altogether. Attempts were made to revive it ten years later but the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> effectually prevented it. It was recommenced, however, in 1802 and has continued ever since. In 1826 the Government tried to change the day to a Sunday, but since 1830 it has always taken place on Whit Tuesday, as formerly.
