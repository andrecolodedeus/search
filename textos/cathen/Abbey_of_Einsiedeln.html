<h1>Abbey of Einsiedeln</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the Canton of Schwyz, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, dedicated to Our Lady of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a>, that title being derived from the circumstances of its foundation, from which the name <em>Einsiedeln</em> is also said to have originated. St. Meinrad, of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Counts of Hohenzollern, was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>, an island in Lake Constance, under his kinsmen Abbots Hatto and Erlebald, where he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. After some years at <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>, and the dependent <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Bollingen, on Lake Zurich, he embraced an <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life and established his hermitage on the slopes of Mt. Etzel, taking with him a wonder-working <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> which he had been given by the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Hildegarde of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>. He died in 861 at the hands of robbers who coveted the treasures offered at the shrine by devout <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, but during the next eighty years the place was never without one or more <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> emulating St. Meinrad's example. One of them, named Eberhard, previously Provost of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, erected a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and church there, of which he became first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The church was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, so the legend runs, in 948, by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself assisted by the Four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, St. Peter, and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>. This event was investigated and confirmed by <a href="../cathen/09160b.htm">Pope Leo VIII</a> and subsequently ratified by many of his successors, the last ratification being by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> in 1793, who confirmed the acts of all his predecessors. In 965 Gregory, the third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Einsiedeln, was made a prince of the empire by <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, and his successors continued to enjoy the same dignity up to the cessation of the empire in the beginning of the nineteenth century. In 1274 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, with its dependencies, was created an independent principality by Rudolf of Hapsburg, over which the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> exercised temporal as well as <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a>. It continued independent until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> is now what is termed <em>nullius dioecesis</em>, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> having quasi-episcopal authority over ten <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> served by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and comprising nearly twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For the learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> Einsiedeln has been famous for a thousand years, and many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and scholars have lived within its walls. The study of letters, printing, and music have greatly flourished there, and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> has contributed largely to the glory of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that discipline declined somewhat in the fifteenth century and the rule became relaxed, but Ludovicus II, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St. Gall who was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Einsiedeln 1526-44, succeeded in restoring the stricter observance. In the sixteenth century the religious disturbances caused by the spread of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> were a source of trouble for some time. <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> himself was at Einsiedeln for a while, and used the opportunity for protesting against the famous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, but the storm passed over and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was left in peace. Abbot Augustine I (1600-29) was the leader of the movement which resulted in the erection of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Congregation of the Order of St. Benedict in 1602, and he also did much for the establishment of unrelaxed observance in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and for the promotion of a high standard of scholarship and learning amongst his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, just mentioned, which have never ceased since the days of St. Meinrad, have tended to make Einsiedeln the rival even of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Loreto, and Compostela, and constitute one of the features for which the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> is chiefly celebrated. The <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> number from 150,000 to 200,000 annually, from all parts of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, originally set up by St. Meinrad, and later <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in the little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> erected by Eberhard, is the object of their devotion. This <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> stands within the great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, in much the same way as the Holy House at Loreto, encased in marbles and precious woodwork, elaborately decorated, though it has been so often restored, rebuilt, and adorned with the offerings of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, that it may be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether much of the original sanctuary still remains. The fourteenth of September and the thirteenth of October are the chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> days, the former being the anniversary of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Eberhard's basilica, and the latter that of the translation of St. Meinrad's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> from <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> to Einsiedeln in 1039. The millenary of St. Meinrad was kept there with great splendour in 1861. The great church has been many times rebuilt, the last time by Abbot Maurus between the years 1704 and 1719, and one of its chief treasures now is a magnificent corona presented by <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> when he made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> there in 1865. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, which dates from 946, contains nearly fifty thousand volumes and many priceless <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> The work of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> is divided chiefly between <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the confessional, and study. At <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> times the number of confessions heard is very large. The community numbers about one hundred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and forty <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, and attached to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> are a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for about two hundred and sixty boys, both of which are taught by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who also direct six <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. In 1854 a colony was sent to America from Einsiedeln to work amongst the native <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a>. From St. Meinrad's Abbey, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, which was the first settlement, daughter-houses were founded, and these in 1881 were formed into the Swiss-American Congregation, which comprised (in 1906) seven <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and nearly four hundred religious. Dom Thomas Bossart, the fifty-third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Einsiedeln and former dean of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, was elected in 1905.
