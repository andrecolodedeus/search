<h1>Abbey of Farfa</h1>  

<p>Situated about 26 miles from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, not far from the Farfa Sabina Railway station. A legend in the "Chronicon Farfense" relates the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Farfa in the time of the Emperors <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>, or Gratian, by the Syrian St. Laurentius, who had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with his sister, Susannah, and had been made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. The legend goes on to say that he afterwards became enamoured of the monastic life, and chose a wooded hill near the Farfa stream, a tributary of the Tiber, on which he built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Archeological discoveries in 1888 seem to prove that the first monastic establishment was built on the ruins of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> temple. This first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was devastated by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> in the fifth century, doubtless about the year 457.

<p>In the seventh century, a wave of monasticism from the North spread over <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The foundation of <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a> by St. Columbanus, and the foundation of Farfa by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Gaul, about 681, heralded a revival of the great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> tradition in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The "Constructio Monaserii Farfensis", a writing which dates probably from 857, relates at length the story of its principal founder Thomas de Maurienne; he had made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Jerusalem and spent three years there. While in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before the Holy Sepulchre, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> in a vision warned him to return to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and restore Farfa; and the Duke of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, Faroald, who had also had a vision, was commanded to aid in this work. At a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> we find traces of this legend in connexion with the foundation by three nobles from <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Beneventum</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Vincent on the Volturno, over which Farfa claimed <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Thomas died in 720; and for more than a century <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> ruled at Farfa.

<p>The Lombard chiefs, and later the Carlovingians, succeeded in withdrawing Farfa from obedience to the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>, and in securing many <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> and privileges for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. If we may credit the "Chronicon Farfense", Farfa was at this period the most important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> both from the point of view of worldly possession and <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a>, with the exception of Nonantula. It had one large basilican church and five smaller ones, rich in masterpieces of religious orf&egrave;verie. The <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> was excited: and about 890, during the government of Abbot Peter, they swooped down on the place. Peter held out against them for seven years, and then resolved to abandon the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. He divided his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> into three sections and shared the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey's</a> wealth among them &mdash; one section he sent towards <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, one towards <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>, and one towards the county of <a href="../cathen/06043c.htm">Fermo</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> preserved Farfa as a stronghold, but some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> robbers set fire to it by mistake.

<p>Between 930 and 936, it was rebuilt by Abbot Ratfredus, who was afterwards poisoned by two wicked <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, Campo and <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, who divided the wealth of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> between them, and ruled over it until Alberic, Prince of the Romans, called in Odo of Cluny to reform Farfa and other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Campo was driven out; and a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> named Dagibert took his place. At the end of five years, he also died by poison &mdash; and the moral condition of Farfa was once more deplorable. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> robbed the altars of their ornaments, and led lives of unbridled vice.

<p>Abbot John III, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, about 967, by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, succeeded, owing to the protection of the Emperor Otho, in re-establishing a semblance of order. But the great reformer of Farfa was Hugues (998-1010). His <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was not secured without <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> &mdash; but the success of his government palliates the vice of his election. At his instance, Odilo, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, and William, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, visited Farfa, and re-established there the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and of study.

<p>The "Consuetudines Farfenses" drawn up about 1010 under the supervision of Guido, successor to Hugues, and recently published by Albers, bear witness to the care with which Hugues organized the monastic life at Farfa. Under the title "Destructio Monasterii", Hugues himself wrote a history of the sad period previous to his rule; and again under the title "Diminutio Monasterii", and "Querimonium", he relates the temporal difficulties that encompassed Farfa owing to the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of petty Roman lords. These works are very important for the historian of the period.

<p>One of Hugue's successors, Berard, Abbot from 1049 to 1089, made the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> a great seat of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Gregory of Catino (b. 1060) arranged the archives. To substantiate Farfa's claims, and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, he edited the "Regesto di Farfa", or "Liber Gemniagraphus sive Cleronomialis ecclesi&aelig; Farfensis" composed of 1324 documents, all very important for the history of Italian <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in the eleventh century. Ugo Balzani praised the accuracy and exactness of this work "planned", he says, "along lines quite in harmony with the best critical efforts of our own times".

<p>In 1103, Gregory wrote the "Largitorium", or "Liber Notarius sive emphiteuticus", a lengthy list of all the concessions, or grants, made by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to its tenants. Having collected all this detailed information, he set to work on a history of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, the "Chronicon Farfense"; and when he was 70 years old, in order to facilitate reference to his earlier works, he compiled a sort of index which he styled "Liber Floriger Chartarum cenobii Farfensis". Gregory was a man of real learning, remarkable in that, as early as the eleventh century, he wrote history with accuracy of view-point, and a great wealth of information.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Farfa owned 683 churches or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>; two towns, Centumcell&aelig; (Civitavecchia) and Alatri; 132 castles; 16 strongholds; 7 sea-ports; 8 salt-mines; 14 villages; 82 mills; 315 hamlets. All this wealth was a hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> once more between 1119 and 1125. And Farfa was troubled by the rivalries between Abbot Guido, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Berard who aimed at being <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. During the Investiture conflict, Farfa was, more or less, on the side of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>. The "Orthodoxa defensio imperialis", written in support of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> party, is, according to Bethmann, the work of Gregory, and of one of his disciples, according to Balzani. The collection of canonical texts contained in the "Regesto", which has been studied by Paul Fournier, seems to omit purposely any mention of the canonical texts of the reforming <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the eleventh century. But when, in 1262, the victory of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> over the last of the Hohenstaufen put an end to Germanic sway in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Farfa sought the protection of <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>, as we learn from a privilege granted on 23 Feb., 1262, and published by Jean Guiraud. At the end of the fourteenth century the Abbey of Farfa became a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalatial</a> <a href="../cathen/07719a.htm"><em>in commendam</em></a>, and since 1842 the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal Bishop</a> of Sabina, a <a href="../cathen/14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, bears also the title of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Farfa.
