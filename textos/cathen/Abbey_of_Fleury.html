<h1>Abbey of Fleury</h1>  

<p>(<em>More completely</em> FLEURY-SAINT-BENO&Icirc;T)

<p>One of the oldest and most celebrated <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Its modern name is Saint-Beno&icirc;t-sur-Loire, applicable both to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and the township with which the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> has always been associated. Situated, as its name implies, on the banks of the Loire, the little town is of easy access from <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>. Its railway station, St-Beno&icirc;t--St-Aignan (Loiret) is a little over a mile from the old Floriacum. Long before reaching the station, the traveller is struck by the imposing mass of a monastic church looming up solitary in the plain of the Loire. The church of Floriacum has survived the stately habitation of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The list of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Fleury contains eighty-nine names, a noble record for one single <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. From Merovingian names like St. Mommolus, and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> names like St. Abbo, we come upon names that arouse different feelings, like Odet de Coligny (Cardinal de Chatillon), Armand du Plessis (<a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal de Richelieu</a>). The last twenty-two <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> held the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>. The list closes with Georges-Louis Ph&eacute;lypeaux, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, in 1789. Tradition, accepted by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, attributes the foundation of Fleury to Leodebaldus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Aignan (Orl&eacute;ans) about 640. Before the days of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> there was a Gallo-Roman villa called Floriacum, in the Vallis aurea. This was the spot selected by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Aignan for his foundation, and from the very St. Fleury seems to have known the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine rule</a>. Rigomarus was its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>.

<p>Church building must have made busy men of many <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Fleury. From the very start the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> boasted of two churches, one in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Peter and the other in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. This latter became the great basilica that started the erection of a gigantic <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> tower, intending it to be one day the west front of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church. His bold plan became a reality, and in 1218 the edifice was completed. It is a fine specimen of the romanesque style, and the tower of Abbot Gauzlin, resting on fifty columns, forms a unique <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a>. The church is about three hundred feet long and one hundred and forty feet wide at the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> alone would repay an artist's journey. The choir of the church contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of a French monarch, Philip I, buried there in 1108. But the boast of Fleury is the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Benedict, the father of <a href="../cathen/10472a.htm">Western monasticism</a>. Mommolus, the second <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fleury, is said to have effected their transfer from <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> when that <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> fell into decay after the ravages of the Lombards. Nothing is more certain than the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in the presence of these precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> at Fleury. To them more than to its flourishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> Fleury owed wealth and fame, and today French <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> surrounds them with no less <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> than when kings came thither to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> impugn the claims of Fleury, but without ever showing any <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to make good their contention that they possess the body of the founder. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> there is much fabulous matter in the Fleury accounts of the famous transfer, but we must remember they were written at the when even good causes were more effectively defended by introducing the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> than by the most obvious natural explanations.
