<h1>Abbey of Floreffe</h1>  

<p>Pleasantly situated on the right bank of the Sambre, about seven miles southwest of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, owes its foundation to Godfrey, Count of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, and his wife Ermensendis. When St. Norbert, in the year after the foundation his order, returned from Cologne with a rich treasure of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> for his new church at <a href="../cathen/12392a.htm">Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</a>, Godfrey and Ermensendis went to meet him and received him in their castle at <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>. So edified were they with what they had seen and heard, that they besought the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> to found a house at Floreffe. The charter by which they made over a church and house to Norbert and his order bears the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 27 Novemher, 1121 that Floreffe is chronologically speaking, the second abbey of the order. Norbert laid the foundations of the church which was called Salve, and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> received the sweet name of Flos Mariae, the Flower of Mary. The chronicles of Floreffe record the following event: While celebrating Mass at Floreffe, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> saw a drop of Blood issuing from the Sacred Host to the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a>. Distrusting his own eyes, he said to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who assisted him: "Brother, do you see what I see?" "Yes, Father" answered the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, "I see a drop of Blood which gives out a brilliant light". The altar stone on which St. Norbert celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> is still preserved at Floreffe. St. Norbert placed Richard, one of his first disciples, at the head of the young community. The second <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Almaric, was commissioned by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Pope Innocent II</a> to preach the Gospel in Palestine. Accompanied by a band of chosen religious of Floreffe, he journeyed to Holy Land and founded the abbey of St. Habacuc (1137). Philip Count of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, gave to Weric, the sixth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, a large piece of the Holy Cross which he had received from his brother Baldwin, emperor of Constantinople. The chronicles record that twice, namely in 1204 and 1254, Blood flowed from this <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> on the Feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> being witnessed by the religious and by a large concourse of people. At the suppression of the Abbey of Floreffe, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was removed to a place of safety. When a few years ago, the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> canons, who had been expelled from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, bought an old Augustinian Monastery at Bois-Seigneur-Isaac, this precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was restored to them, so that it is again in the custody of the sons of St. Norbert. All the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> founded by the Abbey of Floreffe have ceased to exist with the exception of Postel and Leffe. Louis de Fromantau, elected in 1791, was the fifty-fifth and last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Floreffe. When the French Republican army over-ran <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> the religious were expelled, and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> with all its possessions was confiscated. Put up for sale in 1797, it was bought back for the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and his community. After the Concordat the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and a few of his religious returned to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, but so great were the difficulties that after the death of the last religious the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> became the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a> and is now the seat of a flourishing <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.
