<h1>Abbey of Fontenelle</h1>  

<p>(Or ABBEY OF SAINT WANDRILLE).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Normandy (Seine-Inf&eacute;rieure), near Caudebec-en-Caux. It was founded by Saint-Wandrille (Wandregesilus, d. 22 July, 667), the land being obtained through the influence of his friend St-Ouen (Audoenus) <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. St-Wandrille was of the royal family of Austrasia and held a high position at the court of his kinsman, Dagobert I, but being desirous of devoting his life to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he retired to the Abbey of Montfaucon, in Champagne, in 629. Later on he went to Bobbio and then to Romain-Moutiers, where he remained ten years. In 648 he returned to Normandy and founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which afterwards bore his name. He commenced by building a great basilica dedicated to St. Peter, nearly three hundred feet long, which was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by St-Ouen in 657. This church was destroyed by fire in 756 and rebuilt by Abbot Ansegisus (823-33), who added a <a href="../cathen/10704b.htm">narthex</a> and tower. About 862 it was wrecked by <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> pirates and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee for safety. After sojourning at <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, Boulogne, <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>, and other places for over a century, the community was at length brought back to Fontenelle by Abbot Maynard in 966 and a restoration of the buildings was again undertaken. A new church was built by <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> G&eacute;rard, but was hardly finished when it was destroyed by lighting in 1012. Undaunted by this disaster the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> once more set to work and another church was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1033. Two centuries later, in 1250, this was burnt to the ground, but Abbot Pierre Mauviel at once commenced a new one. The work was hampered by want of funds and it was not until 1331 that the building was finished. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> attained a position of great importance and celebrity. It was renowned for the fervour, no less than for the learning of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who during its periods of greatest prosperity numbered over three hundred. Many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and scholars proceeded from its <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>. It was especially noted for its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, where letters, the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and above all calligraphy, were assiduously cultivated.

<p>One of the most notable of its early copyists was <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a>, a celebrated mathematician (d. 811) who wrote with his own hand four copies of the Gospels, one of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, three Sacramentaries, and many other volumes of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> and lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, besides numerous mathematical works. The Fontenelle "Capitularies" were compiled under Abbot Ansegisus in the eighth century. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of St-Wandrille enjoyed many <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges, amongst which were exemption from all river-tolls on the Seine, and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to exact taxes in the town of Caudebec. The charter, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1319, in which were enumerated their chief privileges, was confirmed by Henry V of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and Normandy, in 1420, and by the Council of Basle, in 1436. Commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were introduced at Fontenelle on the sixteenth century and as a result the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> began to decline. In 1631 the central tower of the church suddenly fell, ruining all the adjacent parts, but fortunately without injuring the beautiful <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> or the conventual buildings.

<p>It was just at this time that the newly formed Congregation of St-Maur was revivifying the monasticism of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a> Ferdinand de Neufville invited the <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Maurists</a> to take over the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and do for it what he himself was unable to accomplish. They accepted the offer, and in 1636 set about rebuilding not only the damaged portion of the church, They added new wings and gateways and also built a great chapter-hall for the meetings of the general chapter of the <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Maurist</a> congregation. They infused new life into the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which for the next hundred and fifty years again enjoyed some of its former celebrity. Then came the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, and with it the extinction of monasticism in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. St-Wandrille was suppressed in 1791 and sold by auction the following year. The church was allowed to fall into ruins, but the rest of the buildings served for some time as a factory. Later on they passed into the possession of the de Stacpoole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and were turned to domestic uses. The Duke de Stacpoole, who had become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and who lived at Fontenelle until his death, in 1896, restored the entire <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> (Solesmes congregation), and a colony of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Ligug&eacute; settled there in 1893, under Dom Pothier as superior. This community was expelled by the French government in 1901, and is at present located in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Besides the chief basilica St-Wandrille built several other churches or <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> both within and without the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">monastic enclosure</a>. All of these have either perished in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, or been replaced by others of later date, except one, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St-Saturnin, which stands on the hillside overlooking the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. It is one of the most ancient <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings now existing and, though restored from time to time, is still substantially the original erection of St-Wandrille. It is cruciform, with a central tower and eastern <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, and is a unique example of a seventh-century <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of the village of St-Wandrille also dates from the Saint's time, but it has been so altered and restored that little of the original structure now remains.
