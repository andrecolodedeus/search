<h1>Abbey of Frigolet</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Michael was founded, about 960, at Frigolet, by Conrad the Pacific, King of Arles, on one of the numerous hills which lie between Tarascon and <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon, France</a>. Successively occupied by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of Montmajour, the Augustinians, the <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymites</a>, and finally by the Reformed Augustinians, it was, together with all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, suppressed and sold by the French Republic. From that time it changed hands frequently, and was acquired, at length, by Rev. Edmund Boulbon, who purchased it from Rev. T Delestrac. Edmund Boulbon, b. 14 January, 1817, entered the Abbey of Our Lady of La Trappe at Briquebec, in 1850. Of a robust <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and burning with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, he wished to lead a more active life. Acting on the advice of his superiors, he left the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> and undertook the restoration, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, of the Order of St. Norbert, the constitution of which seemed to be better adapted to his active disposition. On 6 June, feast of St. Norbert, he received the white habit from the hands of Mgr de Gassignies, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, at <a href="../cathen/12392a.htm">Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> approved the project in an audience which he granted to Father Edmund, 4 December, 1856. With the consent of Mgr de Chalandon, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, Father Edmund took possession of Frigolet, and, having admitted several <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, he commenced the community life there. In <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady Conceived without Sin</a> he erected a magnificent church, which was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 6 Oct., 1866. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was canonically erected as a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> on 28 August, 1868; and as an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in Sept., 1869, the Right Rev. Edmund Boulbon being its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. On 8 Nov., 1880, the abbey of Frigolet was seized and the religious expelled. Eventually, however, they were permitted to return. Abbot Boulbon was spared the miseries of a second expulsion, for he died 2 March, 1883.

<p>His successor, Paulinus Boniface, named <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> on 10 June, 1883, undid by his bad administration the good work so nobly begun by Abbot Boulbon; but after a <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> by Mgr Gouthe-Soulard, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, he was deposed, and the direction of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> entrusted to the Rev. Denis Bonnefoy, a prudent and saintly religious. Up to this time, the Abbey of Frigolet, with the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> founded by it, had formed as it were a separate congregation with an organization of its own, having no connexion with the other <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> or the general chapter of the order. This state of affairs was remedied by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 17 Sept., 1898; and the congregation of Frigolet was incorporated with the order. Unfortunately, the Right Rev. Denis Bonnefoy, who was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> on 21 March, 1899, died on 20 Sept. of the same year. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> of Frigolet chose for their <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> Godfrey Madelaine, then <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Abbey of Mondaye, Calvados, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the distinguished author of "L'histoire de S. Norbert" and other books. Meanwhile the French Republic had framed new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against all religious institutions, and on 5 April, 1903, the religious, expelled from their <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, took refuge in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. There, having bought what was left of the former <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Abbey of Leffe near Dinant, they restored it; and continued in the conventual life, in the hope that some day the fathers might be permitted to return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Abbey of Frigolet had founded the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> of Conques and Etoile in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and of Storrington and Bedworth in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It has also sent missionaries to Madagascar.
