<h1>Abbey of Grottaferrata</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Crypta ferrata</em>.)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, sometimes said to occupy the site of Cicero's Tusculanum and situated on the lower slopes of the Alban hills, in the <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Diocese of Frascati</a>, two and a half miles from the town itself. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was founded in 1004 by <a href="../cathen/11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a>, sometimes called "the Younger" or "of <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a>". This <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, a Calabrian Greek, and hence a subject of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>, had left Rossano in 980 to avoid the inroads of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> and with his community had spent the intervening years in various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> without finding a permanent home. The legend narrates that, at the spot where the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> now stands, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> appeared and bade him found a church in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. From Gregory, the powerful Count of Tusculum, father of Popes <a href="../cathen/02428e.htm">Benedict VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/08429b.htm">John XIX</a>, Nilus obtained the site, but died soon afterwards (26 Dec., 1005). The building was carried out by his successors, especially the fourth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, St. Bartholomew, who, is usually accounted the second founder. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> has had a troubled history. The high repute of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> attracted many gifts; its possessions were numerous and widespread, and in 1131 King Roger of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> made the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> Baron of <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a> with an extensive fief. Between the twelfth century and the fifteenth the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> suffered much from the continual strife of warring factions: Romans and Tusculans, <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs and Ghibellines</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, Colonna and Orsini. From 1163 till the destruction of Tusculum, in 1191, the greater part of the community sought refuge in a dependency of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <em>protocaenobium</em> of <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>. In the middle of the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> made the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> his headquarters during the siege of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1378 Breton and Gascon mercenaries held it for the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>; and the fifteenth century saw the bloody feuds of the Colonnas and the Orsini raging round tile walls. Hence in 1432 the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> Ambrogio Traversari tells us that it bore the appearance of a barrack rather than of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In 1462 began a line of commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, fifteen in number, of whom all but one were <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>.

<p>The most distinguished were the Greek <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>, Giulio della Rovere (afterwards <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, and the last of the line, <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a>, secretary of state to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>, himself a <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, increased the scanty and impoverished community and restored the church; Cardinal Giulio della Rovere, from more selfish motives, erected the Castello and surrounded the whole <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with the imposing fortifications that still exist. Till 1608 the community was ruled by <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> dependent on the commendatories, but in that year Grottaferrata became a member of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> congregation founded by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, the revenues of the community were separated from those of the commendatories, and the first of a series of triennial regular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> was appointed. The triennial system survived the suppression of the <em>Commendam</em> and lasted till the end of last century, with one break from 1834 to 1870, when <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> were appointed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1901 new constitutions came into force and Arsenio Pellegrini was installed as the first perpetual regular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> since 1462.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> which was brought to Grottaferrata by <a href="../cathen/11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a> had lost its native character by the end of the twelfth century, and gradually became more and more latinized, but was restored by order of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1881 (see Rocchi, "Badia", cap. iv). The <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> has always been a home of Greek learning, and Greek hymnography flourished there long after the art had died out within the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. Monastic studies were revived under <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a> and again in 1608. The best known of modern <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> writers is the late <a href="../cathen/04464b.htm">Abbot Cozza Luzi</a> (d. 1905), the continuator of <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Cardinal Mai's</a> "Nova Bibliotheca Patrum". Of the church <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08429b.htm">John XIX</a>, in 1024, little can be seen except the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10704b.htm">narthex</a> and over the triumphal arch, the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> structures having been covered or destroyed during the "restorations" of various commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino's</a> famous frescoes, due to Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, are still to be seen in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a>. In 1904 the ninth centenary of the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was marked by a judicious but partial restoration, the discovery of some fragmentary thirteenth century frescoes and an exhibition of Byzantine art. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> has been exempt from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> since the days of <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Calixtus II</a>, but its claims to the dignity of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <em>nullius</em> were disallowed by Benedict. In 1874 the building was declared a national monument and in 1903 the church received the rank of a Roman basilica.
