<h1>Abbey of G&ouml;ttweig</h1>  

<p>(GOTTWEIH, GOTTVICUM, GOTTVICENSE).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> situated on a hill of the same name, not quite four miles south of Krems, in Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. It was founded as a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> by Blessed Altmann, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>. In 1072 the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the church was dedicated, but the solemn dedication of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> did not take place until 1083. The charter of foundation, issued 9 September, 1083, is still preserved in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In 1094 the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> at G&ouml;ttweig had become so lax that Bishop Ulrich of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, with the permission of <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a>, introduced the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>. Prior Hartmann of St. Blasien in the Schwartzwald was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. He took with him from St. Blasien a number of chosen <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, among whom were Bl. Wirnto and Bl. Berthold, who later became Abbots of Formbach and Garsten respectively. Under Hartmann (1094-1114). G&ouml;ttweig became a famous abode of learning and strict monastic observance. He founded a <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, organized a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and built at the foot of the hill, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> where <a href="../cathen/02147b.htm">Ava</a>, the earliest German poetess (d. 1127), lived as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> which was afterwards transferred to the top of the hill, continued to exist until 1557.

<p>The history of G&ouml;ttweig, as might be expected, had its periods of decline as well as prosperity. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it declined so rapidly that from 1556 to 1564 it had no <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and in 1564 not a single <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> was left at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. At this crisis an imperial deputation arrived at G&ouml;ttweig, and elected Michael Herrlich a conventual of <a href="../cathen/10167a.htm">Melk</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (1564-1604) restored the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> spiritually and financially, and rebuilt it after it had been almost entirely destroyed by fire in 1580. Other famous <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were: George Falb (1612-1631) and David Corner (1631-1648), who successfully opposed the spread of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in the district; Gottfried Bessel (q.v. 1714-1749), who rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on a grander scale after it had burnt down in 1718, and inaugurated an era of great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity; and Magus Klein (1768-1783), during whose rule G&ouml;ttweig became a centre of learning. The chief employment of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of G&ouml;ttweig has always consisted in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work. Its present Abbot, Adalbert Dungel (b. 1842, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> since 29 Sept., 1886) is also president of the Austrian <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/07681a.htm">Congregation of the Immaculate Conception</a>. To G&ouml;ttweig belong (Dec., 1908) 65 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 5 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, 4 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, 31 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> administered by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, 3 administered by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and 7 succursal churches. It has a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of 100,000 books and 1100 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and valuable collections of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, engravings, antiquities, and natural history.
