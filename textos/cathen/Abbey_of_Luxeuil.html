<h1>Abbey of Luxeuil</h1>  

<p>Situated in the Department of Haute-Sa&ocirc;ne in Franche-Comt&eacute;, in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>. It was founded in 585 by the great <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, St. Columbanus, on the ruins of the Gallo-Roman castle of Luxovium, about eight miles from Aunigray. It was dedicated to St. Peter and soon became the most important and flourishing <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>. The community was so large, that choir followed choir in the chanting of the Office, and here for the first time was heard the <em>laus perennis,</em> or unceasing psalmody, which went on day and night. Whether St. Columbanus gave this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and others dependent on it an oral or a written rule is uncertain. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it to have been borrowed mostly from that observed in the great <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. But for many reasons this rule was not destined to prevail for long. St. Columbanus had all the force and impetuosity of the ardent <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> temperament, great powers of physical endurance, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral strength. He seems to have lacked the discretion of St. Benedict. His rule, moreover, did not legislate concerning the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> election, his relations with his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and the appointment of monastic officials with delegated power. For long the two rules were observed together, St. Benedict's supplying what was lacking in the other, but by the end of the eighth century the rule of St. Columbanus had given way to what had then become the great monastic code of the West. Driven into exile by King Thierry and his grandmother Queen Brunehaut, St. Columbanus was succeeded as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> by <a href="../cathen/05626a.htm">St. Eustace</a> whom he had placed over the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Luxeuil. During the abbacy of <a href="../cathen/05626a.htm">St. Eustace</a> and that of his successor St. Waldebert, these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> grew to great fame. There came to them many of the young nobles of Gaul, and youths from such cities as Autun, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. They sent forth many who became great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and other parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and to Luxeuil is largely due the conversion and renewal of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> empire. It would be difficult to give an adequate account of the monastic colonization for which Luxeuil was responsible. Among its affiliations were such great houses as Bobbio, between <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, of which St. Columbanus himself became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Saint-Val&eacute;ry and Remiremont. To Luxeuil came such <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> as Conon, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of L&eacute;rins, before setting about the reform of his somewhat degenerated <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and St. Wandrille and St. Philibert who founded respectively the Abbeys of Fontenelle and Jumi&egrave;ges in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, and spent years in studying the rule observed in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which derived their origin from Luxeuil.

<p>In 731 the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> in their destructive career of conquest through western Gaul, took possession of Luxeuil and massacred most of the community. The few survivors rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and later, under the government of the eighteenth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, <a href="../cathen/01545c.htm">St. Ansegisus</a>, it appeared as if it were about to recover its former greatness and prosperity. He received the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> from Louis le D&eacute;bonnaire, restored the church and monastic buildings, and reformed discipline. Many were the privileges and exemptions accorded by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and sovereigns of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but as time went on, it had also to contend with much tribulation and misfortune. Such were the incursions of the Normans and other savage hordes, which were accompanied by the usual pillage and destruction. But it was not till the fifteenth century that the worst <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of all came, namely the institution of commendatory Abbots of Luxeuil and the sure and swift decline of monastic discipline consequent thereon. But this state of things came to an end in 1634. The commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> ceased, and Luxeuil was joined to the reformed congregation of Saint-Vanne. From the report of the "Commission des R&eacute;guliers", drawn up in 1768, the community appears to have been numerous and flourishing, and discipline well kept. At the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were dispersed; but the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, built in the purest French Gothic of the fourteenth century, was not destroyed; neither were the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> and conventual buildings. Until the passing of the recent <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> these buildings were being used as a <em>grand s&eacute;minaire</em> for the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>. They are now either empty or turned to some secular use. The church itself has for long been used as the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Luxeuil.
