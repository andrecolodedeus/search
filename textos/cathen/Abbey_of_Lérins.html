<h1>Abbey of L&eacute;rins</h1>  

<p>Situated on an island of the same name, now known as that of Saint-Honorat, about a league from the coast of Provence, in the Department of the Maritime Alps, now included in the <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Diocese of Nice</a>, formerly in that of Grasse or of Antibes. It was founded at the beginning of the fifth century by <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> lived there at first the life of a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, but followers soon gathered around him. They came from all parts of Roman Gaul and even from Brittany. During the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries, the influence exerted by the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was considerable. The presence of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> in Provence made the monastic life impossible or precarious for two centuries. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was restored in the eleventh century, and a new era of prosperity began. It was given many estates and churches in the neighbouring Dioceses of Antibes, <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, Arles, <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a>, <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">Digne</a>, Senez, Vence, <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>, <a href="../cathen/15343a.htm">Ventimiglia</a>, etc. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, the counts of Provence, and the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> bestowed on it many privileges. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> to take an active part in defending the coasts against incursions of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> of Algeria. A monumental tower, built as a place of refuge, is still standing. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was an important strategic position in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries during the Franco-Spanish <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. The <em>commendam</em> was introduced at L&eacute;rins in 1464. There was a crying need for reform. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were placed under the Italian Congregation of St. Justina of Padua (1515), which brought about for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> a long era of prosperity, both spiritual and material. The subsequent union with the French Congregation of St. Maur (1637) was of brief duration. A century later the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave the Italian congregation to become a part of Cluny. The decline had already commenced; it steadily increased until the time of suppression (1791). The religious had followed the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a> from the seventh century onwards.

<p>During the first period of its history, L&eacute;rins gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and writers. Through them the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> played an important role. Such were <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a>, his successor St. Hilary, and St. Caesarius, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Arles; St. Maximus and <a href="../cathen/06019b.htm">Faustus</a>, Bishops of Riez, <a href="../cathen/05595a.htm">St. Eucherius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>; St. Lupus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>; St. Valerianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cimiez; St. Salvianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, St. Veranus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vence; and the celebrated Vincent de L&eacute;rins. The presence of so many writers in one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> has given rise to the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that it was a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which, however, it was not. L&eacute;rins had a reputation for learning, but it had no organized teaching body. The part given to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of L&eacute;rins in the editing of certain legends by M. Dufourcq is strongly contested. We find no writer of note from the seventh to the thirteenth century; after that came the troubadour Raymond F&eacute;raud; then <a href="../cathen/04400a.htm">Giovanni Andrea Gregorio Cortese</a>, who died in 1548; Dionysius Faucher, who died in 1562; the historian of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, Vincent Barralis, who died at the beginning of the seventeenth century.

<p>Besides these writers and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, L&eacute;rins had also many <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>; we must mention St. Antonius; the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Aigulf, who introduced the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a> about 661; Abbot Porcharius II, who was massacred with his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> about 732. <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, the apostle of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, lived some time in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, as well as St. Cassian, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Victor at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was restored by the Congregation of S&eacute;nanque in 1868. They preserved whatever remained of the ancient monastic buildings, that is to say the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, the refectory, and the chapter hall, which they enclosed in the new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The fortress, of which the construction was begun in 1073 as a place of refuge in case of sudden attack, is fairly well preserved. The records, as well as the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the old <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, are in the archives of the Maritime Alps at <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>. Few <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> have a history to which so much attention has been devoted as that of L&eacute;rins.
