<h1>Abbey of Mellifont</h1>  

<p>Located three miles from Drogheda, Co. Louth, Diocese of Armagh, it was the first <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> established in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In the year 1140, <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a>, <em>en route</em> for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, visited <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, and was so edified that he resolved to establish a similar <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in his own diocese of Armagh. He therefore left several of his companions at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, to make their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> under the direction of St. Bernard. In 1142 they returned to found Mellifont under Christian O'Conarchy, who had been <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Down and who became the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Father Robert, an able architect, directed the construction of the monastic buildings according to the plans of the <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Abbey of Clairvaux</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the church in 1157 was the occasion of great religious celebrations. So numerous were the <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> that six important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded during the first ten years: Bective (1146); Boyle (1148); Monasternenagh (1148); Baltinglas (1148); Schrule (1150); Newry (1153). In 1150 the venerable Abbot Christian was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugene III</a>, who had been his fellow-novice at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, named him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Soon after his death (1186) his name was inscribed in the calendar of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and he has long been <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as one of the most powerful protectors of his country. His brother Malchus, equally illustrious for his <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, succeeded him. For sixty years Mellifont rejoiced in great prosperity, and when the English invaded <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> there were already twenty-five great <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the rivalries between the English and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> exerted a baneful influence, peace gave way to discord, and in more than one case the general chapter, and even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>, were forced to intervene. Not until the fifteenth century did Mellifont regain its ancient prestige, which was maintained until its <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">suppression by Henry VIII</a> on 23 July, 1539, when one hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were compelled to leave with Richard Contour, the last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Mellifont. The king seized the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and the annals were either lost or destroyed, and with them the names of many remarkable men. Several religious continued to live in the environs, which explains why, in 1623, the title of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Mellifont was granted, by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Apostolic Brief</a>, to Patrick Barnewall, and again in 1648 to John Devreux when the title disappears. In 1566 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, with its dependencies, was given to Edward Moore, chief of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> Drogheda, and passed, in 1727, to Balfour of Townley Hall, during whose term of ownership all fell to the speedy decay and desolate ruin of the present day.
