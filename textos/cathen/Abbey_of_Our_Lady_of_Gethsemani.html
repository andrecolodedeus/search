<h1>Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani</h1>  

<p>An abbey of the Order of Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, commonly called <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, established in 1848 in Nelson Co., <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Diocese of Louisville</a>, being the first <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> on American soil. On 26 Oct., 1848, a colony of forty <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> left the Abbey of Melleray, in the <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Diocese of Nantes</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, under the leadership of Dom Eutrope Proust, and arrived at <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> early in December. They travelled by river to <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, where Bishop Flaget, who had greatly desired their coming, received them. On 21 December they took possession of the lands destined for their establishment, and shortly afterwards their number was increased by a second colony of twenty religious from the motherhouse. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> undertook the work of clearing their lands with indomitable energy, and little by little arose the imposing structures which form the present <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. This is an immense quadrilateral, one side of which is formed by the church, whilst the other three sides contain the monastic quarters, with a commodious guesthouse for those who desire to spend a few days in solitude.

<p>In 1850 a pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> (21 July) erected the new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> into an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. By a unanimous vote Dom <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and on 1 May, 1851, received the abbatial blessing from Bishop M. J. Spalding of <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, in the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Bardstown. It was the first <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the kind performed and returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He left Dom Benedict Berger in charge, who was soon after elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and received the abbatial blessing in St. Catherine's Church, New Haven, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, 9 May, 1861. Dom Benedict insisted with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> on the observance of the rule, and under his administration the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> buildings were finished. The church was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, 15 Nov., 1866. Stricken with paralysis in 1887, Dom Benedict resigned his charge in 1889. The administration then passed to Dom M. Edward Chaix-Bourbon, who was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> 9 May, 1890, and received the abbatial blessing in the church of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, 29 September following. Dom Edward applied himself especially to improve the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> since its foundation. He erected new buildings, and transformed it into a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>. During a visit to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, upon the advice of physicians, he had to renounce his hopes of seeing Gethsemani again, and on 24 Jan., 1898, he was succeeded by Dom M. Edmond M. Obrecht, first appointed superior and shortly afterwards elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> by unanimous vote; he received the abbatial blessing at Gathsemani, 28 Oct., 1898. Through the generosity of Mgr. Batz of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, Dom Edmund was able to create the splendid <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> which contains more than thirty thousand volumes of the principal authors on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>.

<p>That the regime of La Trappe is entirely incompatible with the American temperament is a prejudice without foundation. The community has always numbered some, and now numbers over one-third, Americans amongest its religious, some of whom were raised in luxury, and all have found health and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> at Gethsemani. Another prejudice is the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> life, being a penitent life, is only intended for criminals. Life at Gethsemi is the same as <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> life at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, a life of contemplation and penance. Moreover, recent decrees of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiffs</a> and the constitutions of the order forbid the reception of men who have given public scandal. The community of Gethsemani is at present (1908) composed of 80 religious: 34 members of the choir, 22 of whom are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, whilst the others are preparing themselves, by the regular studies, for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; 46 are <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> who are more especially engaged in the work of the farm.
