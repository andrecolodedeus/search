<h1>Abbey of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</h1>  

<p>Located about twelve miles west of Laon, Department of Aisne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; founded by <a href="../cathen/11100b.htm">St. Norbert</a>. The land had belonged to the Abbey of St. Vincent, to whom it had been given by a former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon. Religious of St. Vincent's had tried in vain to cultivate it. As shown in the charter of donation the place was called <em>Pr&aelig;monstratus</em>, or <em>pratum monstratum, Pr&eacute;-montr&eacute;</em>, probably from a clearing made in the forest, but the name has easily lent itself to the adapted meaning of <em>locus pr monstratus</em>, a place foreshown, as for example in the life of St. Godfrey, one of St. Norbert's first disciples (1127): "Venit ad locum vere juxta nomen suum, a Domino pr monstratum, electum et pr&aelig;destinatum" (Acta SS., II January). A venerable tradition says that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon and St. Norbert visited Pr&eacute;montr&eacute; about the middle of January and that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gave the white habit to St. Norbert on 25 January, the feast of the Conversion of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. At the conclusion of the Council of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> (1131), <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> and St. Norbert came to Laon and remained with Bishop Bartholomew. They also visited the Abbey of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute; and were rejoiced to see some five hundred religious &#151; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and lay-brothers &#151; all united in the observance of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> under Abbot Hugh of Fosse. In the general chapter of 1141 it was decided to remove the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> to at least one league's distance from the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of men. Hugh died on 10 Feb., 1161, and was succeeded by Philip, then <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Belval in Argonne. John II founded in 1252 a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> or house of studies for <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>.

<p>At the death of Virgilius, forty-third Abbot General of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;, Cardinal Francis of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> had intrigued so much at the Court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that he succeeded in being named commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;, and in 1535 took possession of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and all its revenues. Cardinal Francis was succeeded by Cardinal d'Este, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who held the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> until he died in 1572. Tai&eacute;e ("Etude sur Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;", Laon, 1874, 210) calls these two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> <em>les fl&eacute;auz de Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</em>. After the death of Cardinal d'Este a free election was held and Jean Des Pruets, Doctor of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, an earnest and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, was elected, and his election confirmed by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, 14 Dec., 1572. With admirable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> Des Pruets undertook the difficult task of repairing the financial losses and of promoting conventual discipline at Pr&eacute;montr&eacute; and other houses of the order. He died 15 May, 1596, and was succeeded by two <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, Longpr&eacute; and Gosset; but the latter was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a>, as <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a>. The last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> general, L'Ecuy, was elected in 1781. At the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the confiscated Abbey of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute; was bought by a certain Cagnon, who demolished several buildings and sold the material. Having passed through several hands, the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was bought by Mgr de Garsignies, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon and <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, whose successor sold it to the Department of Aisne, by whom the buildings were converted into an asylum. Of the old <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> as it was from the twelfth to the sixteenth century hardly anything remains, but three large buildings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are still standing. A part of one of these buildings is used as a church, dedicated to St. Norbert.
