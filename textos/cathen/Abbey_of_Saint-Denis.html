<h1>Abbey of Saint-Denis</h1>  

<p>The Abbey of Saint-Denis is situated in a small town to which it has given its name, about four miles north of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. St-Denis (Dionysius), the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and his companions <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 270, were buried here and the small <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> built over the spot became a famous place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> during the fifth and sixth centuries. In 630 King Dagobert founded the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> for <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, replacing the original <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> by a large basilica, of which but little now remains. He and his successors enriched the new foundation with many gifts and privileges and, possessing as it did the shrine of St-Denis, it became one of the richest and most important <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 653 it was made exempt from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. A new church was commenced in 750 by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of which Christ, according to popular tradition, was supposed to have assisted in person. During the ninth century irregularities crept in and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> transformed themselves into canons with a relaxed rule. Abbot Hilduin tried in vain to reform them and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to retire for a time, with a few of the more fervent <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, to a neighboring <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>. At length, however, he succeeded in bringing about a better state of things and was able to resume the government of his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. From that time forward its splendour and importance continued to increase under the wise rule of a succession of great <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, to whom the right of <em>pontificalia</em> was granted by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> in 1179. Most famous perhaps amongst these was <a href="../cathen/14326a.htm">Suger</a>, the thirty-sixth of the series (1122-52). Besides being a great ecclesiastic he was also a great statesman and acted as Regent of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> whilst King Louis VII was absent on the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. The present church of St-Denis was commenced by him about 1140 and marks the beginning of the Gothic tendency in architecture and its transition from the Romanesque style. Further additions and alterations under succeeding <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> resulted in producing one of the finest Gothic buildings in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE</a>).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> figured prominently in the history of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were for several centuries amongst the chief seigneurs of the kingdom. The "Oriflamme", originally the banner of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, became the standard of the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and was suspended above the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, whence it was only removed when the king took the field in person. Its last appearance was at the battle of Agincourt in 1415. <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a> hung up her arms in the church of St-Denis in 1429. Many kings and princes and other noble <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were buried there and three of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a> stayed in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at different times: <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> in 754, <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> in 1131, and Eugenius III in 1146. Another great <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Matthieu de Vendome, acted as administrator of the kingdom when St. Louis went to the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> in 1269. After the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> the Abbey of St-Denis became the head of a congregation of ten <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and in 1633 it was united, with its dependent houses, to the new Congregation of St-Maur, when its conventual buildings were entirely reconstructed. In 1691 <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> suppressed the abbacy and united the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with its revenues to the royal house of noble ladies at St-Cyr, founded by <a href="../cathen/09548b.htm">Madame de Maintenon</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was finally dissolved at the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolution</a>, when much damage was done to the church and <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>. It was subsequently restored, under <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>, by Viollet-le-Duc. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St-Denis, which had been transferred to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of the town in 1795, were brought back again to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 1819. It is now a "national monument" and one of the show-places of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Many of the <a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">chartularies</a> and other <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> relating to its history are now either in the Archives Nationales or the Bibliotheque Nationale.
