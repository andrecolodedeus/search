<h1>Abbey of Saint-Victor</h1>  

<p>In the year 1108, the famous <a href="../cathen/15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a>, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Notre-Dame in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, who had been lecturing to crowds of students, relinquishing his chair, retired to a small hermitage dedicated to St. Victor, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> soldier, near the city. Here he was followed by many of his disciples, <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> among them, and induced again to take up his lectures. Hence the origin of the Royal Abbey and School of St. Victor. With some of his followers, William had become a canon regular, but, at the request of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a> in 1113, and was succeeded at St. Victor's by Gildwin, a man, as the "Necrologium" records, of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in promoting the canonical order. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, by the generosity of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, kings, queens, and noblemen, was soon richly endowed. Numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of canons regular were reformed by its canons. Ste. Genevi&egrave;ve (Paris), Wigmore in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, St. Augustine's (Bristol), 1148), St. Catherine's (Waterford), St. Thomas's (Dublin), St. Peter's (Aram, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>) were of the number. No less than forty <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of the order of St. Victor are mentioned in his last will by King Louis VIII, who left all his jewels for the erection of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church and 4000 pounds to be equally divided among them. At the general chapter which was convened every year, there were present some 100 <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a>. Before the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was 160 years old, several <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and at least eight <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, all sons of St. Victor's, were at the head of as many <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, among them John, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ste. Genevi&egrave;ve (Paris), and Andrew, an Englishman, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Wigmore.

<p>The traditions of <a href="../cathen/15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a> were handed on, and St. Victor's became a centre of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, with those of <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a> and Notre-Dame, was the cradle of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. To that celebrated <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> flocked crowds of students from all countries. Among them were men like Hugh of Blankenburg, better known as <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, called the St. Augustine of his time; Richard, a Scotchman, the mystic doctor; Adam, the greatest poet of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; <a href="../cathen/11763b.htm">Peter Comestor</a>, the historian; <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, the <em>magister sententiarum</em>; Thomas, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Andrew's (Verceil), to whom St. Francis sent <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a> for his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies; another Thomas, prior at the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> who, nearly fifty years before his namesake of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, gave his life for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> sake. To St. Victor's came, only four months before his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, the same St. Thomas &agrave; Becket and addressed his brother canons on the words: "In pace factus est locus ejus". The "Scotichronicon" records that in 1221 a canon of St. Victor's, in his capacity of <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, visited <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, where at Perth he convoked all the ecclesiastical dignitaries to a general convention which lasted four days.

<p>The time came when <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> were introduced and signs of decay were manifested. Towards the end of the fifteenth century some efforts were made to reform the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> with canons brought from the newly-established Windesheim congregation. A few years later Cardinal de Larochefoucauld again attempted to reform it, but in vain. The canons, moreover, were implicated in the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist movement</a>, only one, the Venerable Jourdan, remaining faithful to the old spirit and traditions. At that time there lived at St. Victor Santeul, the great classical poet, whose Latin proses were adopted by the Gallican Liturgy. The end of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> came with the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. In 1800 the church and the other buildings were sold, the famous <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was dispersed, and a few years later everything had disappeared. There are still a few <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of canonesses, at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, Ypres, and Neuilly, who keep the rule and spirit which they originally received from the Abbey of St. Victor's.
