<h1>Abbey of Saint Albans</h1>  

<p>Located in Hertfordshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; founded about 793 by <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa, king of the Mercians</a>. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (Hist. Eccles., I, vii), writing at the beginning of the eighth century, speaks of a church, existing at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, of wonderful workmanship and worthy of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> it commemorated. <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa's</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> seems to have been attached to this church, which he repaired, having personally obtained the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> approval for his foundation. Willegod, a relation of the king, was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. By the year 1000 the old church was evidently in a dilapidated state again and Ealdred and Eadmer, the eighth and ninth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, collected materials to build a new church from the ruins of the Roman city of Verulam. The actual building was only begun in 1077, when Abbot Paul of Caen, a relative of <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Archbishop Lanfranc</a>, undertook the work with such energy that the whole church was completed in eleven years; a large part of this church still remains. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> increased in wealth and importance; <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> exempted it from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and gave it precedence over all other <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. In the Wars of the Roses St. Albans suffered much, and the unsettled state of the country involved the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in a long series of lawsuits by which it was much impoverished. In 1521 <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a> became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>, the only instance of this practice known in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. On his disgrace in 1529 Robert Catton, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Norwlch, was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, but was deprived in 1538 to make room for a nominee of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, Robert Boreman, by whom the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was surrendered to the king in the following year. The list of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> may be found in Dugdale. <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a> is probably the most famous <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the foundation, which is <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> for refusing to accept Nicholas Breakspere, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a>, when he begged for admission as a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>. The church of St. Albans escaped destruction at the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and in 1553 was purchased from the Crown for &#163;400 by the mayor and burgesses of the town, to be used as a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. Of the church built by Paul of Caen most of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>, and presbytery still exist, but portions fell and were rebuilt in the style of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The eastern part of the presbytery with the Lady <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> beyond it also belong to the latter periods. In the second half of the nineteenth century the late Lord Grimthorpe undertook to restore the building at his own expense. In spite of all remonstrance he did this in such a way that "to grimthorpe" has now become an active verb signifying the unintelligent mutilation of an ancient building under the cloak of restoration. The church is 550 feet long, and 190 wide across the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>, the central tower being 144 feet high. It contains a famous reredos of the late fifteenth century, the reconstructed base of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a> shrine, and several fine chantries and monuments. Of the conventual buildings only the gatehouse now remains.
