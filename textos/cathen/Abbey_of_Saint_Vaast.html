<h1>Abbey of Saint Vaast</h1>  

<p>Situated at <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>, the ancient capital of Artois, Department of Pas-de-Calais, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; founded in 667. St. Vaast, or Vedast, was born in western <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> about 453; and died at <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> in 540. Having lived for some years as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> in the Diocese of Toul, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by St. Remi (Remigius), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, who deputed him to prepare <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> for the reception of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a>. After this he remained at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and acted as <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> for St. Remi. In 499 that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>, and his labours in planting the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in those parts were blessed by many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Ten years later St. Remi committed to him the care also of the <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Diocese of Cambrai</a>, and these two sees remained united until the eleventh century. At the death of St. Remi he was chosen to succeed him but declined the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. His own death occurred in 540 and he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>. In 667 St. Auburt, the seventh <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, commenced to build an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> for <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> on the site of a little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> which St. Vedast had erected in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Peter. St. Vedast's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were transferred to the new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which was completed by St. Auburt's successor and munificiently endowed by King Theodoric, who together with his wife was afterwards buried there. This Abbey of St-Vaast flourished for many centuries and held an important position amongst the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the Low Countries. It was ruled by many distinguished <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, a list of whom, numbering seventy-nine, is given in <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia christiana"</a>. It was exempt from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and maintained its independence until 1778 when it was aggregated to the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Congregation of Cluny</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> it was suppressed and the conventual buildings became first a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and then a barrack. In 1838 the barrack was purchased by the town, a portion being used as a museum and archivium, and the rest becoming the residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The church, which had been <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> and partially destroyed, was rebuilt and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1833 and now serves as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.
