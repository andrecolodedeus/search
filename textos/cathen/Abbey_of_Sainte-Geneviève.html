<h1>Abbey of Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve</h1>  

<p>The Abbey of Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, was founded by <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">King Clovis</a> who established there a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, later called canons regular. How long these <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> observed the regular life is unknown, but in 1147 secular canons officiated in the church. King Louis VII and Pope III, having witnessed some disorders, determined to restore the regular discipline and at first thought to call <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, but as the canons preferred some of their own order, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> consented. At the request of <a href="../cathen/14326a.htm">Sugerus</a> and <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, Gildwin, the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Victor's, St. Bernard, Gildwin, the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Victor's where the canonical rule had been recently established, consented to send Odo, the Prior of his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. There were difficulties, but order finally prevailed and some of the canons joined the reform. Among these was the young Canon William, already known for his virtues and learning. At the request of Absalon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Roskild, in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, who when a student at Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve's had known him, William was sent to that country to reform a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of canons in the Isle of Eskil. In spite of untold trials, obstacles, and persecutions he succeeded in his enterprise and even founded another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which he dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Holy Paraclete</a>. He died in 1206, and was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>. It was natural that close relations should exist between Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve's and its foundations in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Peter, a young man who made his profession at the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Roskild; Valdemar, brother of King Knut, died at Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve's; and Abbot <a href="../cathen/14291c.htm">Stephen of Tournai</a> wrote to William and his friends to obtain lead for the roof of his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>.

<p>Like the Abbey of St-Victor, Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve's became a celebrated seat of learning. St-Victor's, Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve's, and Notre-Dame were the cradle of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> at different epochs lectured in this abbey-school. By right and custom the two sister-abbeys frequently exchanged subjects. Peter de Ferri&egrave;re, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Victor's was at one time <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Epinay, a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve's; <a href="../cathen/15631d.htm">William of Auxerre</a>, a professed canon of St-Victor's in 1254, held the office of cellarer, and became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve's; and Marcel, successively canon at St-Victor's and Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve's, was in 1198 made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cisoing. Like most <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, falling into the hands of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>, relaxation and disorders were the consequence. In the beginning of the seventeenth century Cardinal de La Rochefoucauld undertook its reform. He brought from Senlis a holy man, Charles Faure, who had already restored the canonical rule in the ancient Abbey of Silvanect. Once more the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> was faithfully observed at Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve's which became the mother-house of the Gallican congregation. Charles Faure died in 1644. The second spring of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was perhaps even more glorious than the first. By the middle of the seventeenth century the abbot-general of the congregation had under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> more than one hundred <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a>. Men like Fronteau, chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and author of many works, Laleman, Chapponel, Reginier, Chengot, Beurier, du Moulinet, founder of the national <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and Augustine Hay, a Scotchman who wrote the "Scotia sacra" and officiated at <a href="../cathen/07423a.htm">Holyrood</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, in 1687, were sons of the French congregation. When in 1790 the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolutionary</a> assembly declared all religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> void, and opened the doors to all the inmates of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, there were thirty-nine canons at Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve's. This was the end of that illustrious <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.
