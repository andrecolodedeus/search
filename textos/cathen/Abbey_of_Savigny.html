<h1>Abbey of Savigny</h1>  

<p>Situated on the confines of <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a> and Brittany, <a href="../cathen/04455b.htm">Diocese of Coutances</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Founded by Vital de Mortain, Canon of the Collegiate Church of St. Evroul, who, resigning his <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a> to embrace an <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life under <a href="../cathen/13096a.htm">Robert of Arbrissel</a> in the forest of Craon (Anjou), and leaving the latter, retired to the forest of Savigny (1105), where he built a hermitage. Soon, however, the number of disciples who gathered around him necessitated the construction of adequate buildings, in which was instituted the monastic life, following the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, and interpreted in a manner similar to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>. Rudolph, lord of Fougeres, confirmed to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (1112) the grants he had formerly made to Vital, and from then dates the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Once firmly established, its growth was rapid, and it soon became one of the most celebrated in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Its founder was judged worthy of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, and many of his successors in the abbatial office, as well as simple religious of the Abbey, were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> or <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the best known of them being St. Aymon. From the number of its foundations Savigny became the head of a Congregation, numbering thirty-three subordinate houses, within thirty years of its own inception. In 1119 <a href="../cathen/03478a.htm">Pope Celestine II</a>, then in <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, took it under his immediate protection, and strongly commended it to the neighbouring nobles. Under Geoffroy, successor to Vital, Henry I, of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, established and generously endowed twenty-nine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of this Congregation in his dominions. <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> also held them in high esteem, and it was at his request that their <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, in the troubled times of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus</a>, declared in favour of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Pope Innocent II</a>. Serlon, third successor of the Founder, found it difficult to retain his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, who wished to make themselves independent, and so determined to affiliate the entire Congregation to <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, which was effected at the General Chapter of 1147. Several <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> objecting to this, were finally <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to submit by <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugene III</a> (1148). Little by little discipline became relaxed, and commendatory Abbots being introduced (1501) it never regained its first greatness. In 1509 it was pillaged and partly burned by the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, and records of the following year mention but twenty-four <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> remaining. It continued to exist until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> reduced it to a heap of ruins, and scattered its then existing members. The church, a model of <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> architecture, was restored in 1869, and now serves for <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> purposes. Of all its former dependencies, there remains only La Grande Trappe. This, though not founded directly was a daughter of the Abbey of Breuil-Benoit, which latter was a direct filiation of Savigny.
