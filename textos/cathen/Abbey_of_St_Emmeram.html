<h1>Abbey of St. Emmeram</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (Regensburg), named after its traditional founder, the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the city. The exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of foundation is unknown. <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> flourished in the middle of the seventh century and 652 is given by most authorities as the approximate date of the establishment of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Its beginnings were connected with a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in which certain much <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were preserved, and which, in 697, was enlarged and beautified by Theodo, Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, who built at the same time a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, of which Appollonius was first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. It was still further enlarged by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> about the year 800 and endowed with extensive possessions and many privileges. When <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, in 739, divided <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> into four diocese, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> fixed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a>, but later on it was removed by a subsequent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the old Cathedral of St. Stephen, which stands beside the present one. In 830, the then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> obtained from Louis, King of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the administration of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> for himself and his successors, and for upwards of a hundred years the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> ruled the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but in 968 <a href="../cathen/15682b.htm">St. Wolfgang</a> restored its independence and from that time forward it enjoyed the rule of its own <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. For some centuries it was customary to elect as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> a canon of St. Stephen's and a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram's</a> alternately. Many of the early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> were buried in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church and their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> are still to be seen there, as also is that of the Emperor Arnulph (d. 899). The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> held the rank of princes of the Empire, and as such had a seat in the Imperial Diets. The present church, which is a Romanesque basilica, dates from the thirteenth century, but was restored in a somewhat debased style in the eighteenth. It is one of the few German churches with a detached <a href="../cathen/02394d.htm">bell-tower</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was suppressed early in the nineteenth century and in 1809 the conventual buildings became the palace of the Prince of Thurn and Taxis, hereditary postmaster-general of the old <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> still (1909) reside there. The <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> garth, in the centre of which is a modern mortuary <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, is now used as the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> burial-place.
