<h1>Abbey of St. Gall</h1>  

<p>In <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, Canton St. Gall, 30 miles southeast of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>; for many centuries one of the chief <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; founded about 613, and named after Gallus, an Irishman, the disciple and companion of St. Columbanus in his exile from Luxeuil. When his master went on to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Gallus remained in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, where he died about 646. A <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was erected on the spot occupied by his cell, and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Othmar was placed there by <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> as custodian of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. Under his direction a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was built, many privileges and benefactions being upon it by <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> and his son Pepin, who with Othmar as first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, are reckoned its principal founders. By Pepin's persuasion Othmar substituted <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">the Benedictine rule</a> for that of St. Columbanus. He also founded the famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of St. Gall, and under him and his successors the arts, letters, and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> were assiduously cultivated. The work of copying <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> was undertaken at a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, and the nucleus of the famous <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> gathered together. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> gave hospitality to numerous Anglo-Saxon and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who came to copy <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> for their own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Two distinguished guests of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> were Peter and Romanus, chanters from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, sent by <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a> at <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> request to propagate the use of the <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a>. Peter went on to <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, where he established an important chant-school, but Romanus, having fallen sick at St. Gall, stayed there with <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> consent. To the copies of the Roman chant that he brought with him, he added the "Romanian signs", the interpretation of which has since become a matter of controversy, and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> he started at St. Gall, rivalling that of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, became one of the most frequented in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> produced by it, still extant, are the "Antiphonale Missarum" (no. 339), the "Antiphonarium Sti. Gregorii" (no. 359), and Hartker's "Antiphonarium" (nos. 390-391), the first and third of which have been reproduced in facsimile by the <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a> fathers in their "Pal&eacute;ographie Musicale". The other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> &mdash; for the younger <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and for lay scholars attracted thither by the fame of the monastic professors &mdash; were founded as early as the ninth century, for the well-known, but unrealized plan of 820 provides separate accommodation for both <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The domestic history of the community during these centuries of consolidation was not altogether free from troubles. Even during the lifetime of Othmar, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had to defend themselves against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, who, having already secured <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the neighbouring Abbey of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>, refused to recognise the exemption and other privileges of St. Gall. For many years the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had to fight for their independence, but it was not until the time of Louis the Pious that their efforts were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with success and their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> confirmed. From that time up to the end of the tenth century was the golden age of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, during which flourished many celebrated scholars &mdash; the three <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notkers</a>, <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Eckhard</a>, Hartker and others. The decrees of the Council of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> (817) for the furtherance of discipline and the religious spirit were loyally carried into effect by Abbot Gotzbert (815-837), under whom the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> built a new and magnificent church and by whom also the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was greatly enlarged. He purchased many fresh <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and set his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to multiply copies of them. His successor Grimald (841-872) carried on the work, and a catalogue drawn up in his time, still extant, shows the wide range of subjects represented. Over four hundred of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> mentioned in that catalogue are still at St. Gall.

<p>During the abbacy of Engelbert II (924-933) an incursion of the Huns threatened the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and most of the valuable books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were removed to <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> for safety, some never being returned. In 937 a disastrous fire almost entirely destroyed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> fortunately escaped. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and town were rebuilt and fortified, and throughout the eleventh and twelfth centuries St. Gall maintained its place in the front rank of monastic establishments. With the thirteenth century, however, came a period of decline. Various causes contributed to this, one of them being the fact that the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lords took to quartering themselves and their retinues upon the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> more often than was good for monastic discipline. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> also were frequently called upon to settle their quarrels, and a spirit of worldliness thus crept into the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. About the same time the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and town became an independent principality, over which the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> ruled as territorial sovereigns, taking rank as Princes of the Empire. Ulrich VI (1204-1220) was the first to hold that dignity. Records as to the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> during this period are scanty. In the fourteenth century Humanists were allowed to take away some of the rarest of the classical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and in the sixteenth the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was raided by the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, who scattered many of the most valuable books. In 1530 Abbot Diethelm inaugurated a restoration with such success that he has been called the third founder of St. Gall. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was one of his chief cares and his successors <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> followed his good example. Through their efforts the monastic spirit, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the studies all revived and attained to something of their former greatness. In 1602, when the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> congregation of the Order of St. Benedict was formed, the Abbey of St. Gall took precedence as the first house of the congregation, and many of its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> subsequently held the office of president.

<p>A printing-press was started under Pius (1630-1674), which soon became one of the most important in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. In 1712 a great change came over the fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. It was pillaged by the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>, who spared nothing. Most of the books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were carried off to <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> and other places, and only a portion of them were afterwards restored to St. Gall. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the time, Leodegar by name, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> for security to place his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under the protection of the townspeople whose ancestors had been serfs of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, but who had, since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, thrown off the yoke of subjection. When these disturbances were over, a final attempt was made to revive the glories of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was rebuilt for the last time under Abbots Celestine II and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, but the resuscitation was short-lived. In 1798 the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> directory suppressed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principality and secularized the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and in 1805 its revenues were sequestrated. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> took refuge in other houses of the congregation, the last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Pancras Forster, dying in 1829 at <a href="../cathen/10643a.htm">Muri</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a> was suppressed in 1821, that portion of it in which St. Gall was situated was united to the Diocese of Coire, but in 846 a rearrangement made St. Gall a separate see, with the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church as its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and a portion of the monastic buildings being resigned for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> residence. The church, rebuilt 1755-65 in the <a href="../cathen/13106a.htm">rococo style</a>, contains some finely-carved choir stalls and a beautiful wrought iron screen. The conventual buildings, besides the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace, now accommodate also the cantonal offices and what remains of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> &mdash; about thirty thousand volumes and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The town of St. Gall has a population of over 30,000 and is one of the principal manufacturing centres in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, muslin and cotton being its chief industries.
