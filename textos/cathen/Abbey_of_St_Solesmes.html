<h1>Abbey of St. Solesmes</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Department of Sarthe, near Sabl&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. It was founded in 1010 by Geoffrey, seigneur of Sabl&eacute;, as a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> dependent on the Abbey of St-Pierre de la Couture at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>. During the Hundred Years' War it was twice pillaged and once almost entirely destroyed by fire. Apart from these disasters its history was uneventful for several centuries. Towards the end of the fifteenth century the rebuilding of the church was commenced, Prior Philibert de la Croix changing it from basilica form to that of a Latin cross. His successor, Jean Bougler (1505-1556), completed the restoration of the church, added the tower, and rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>, <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. Under his direction two famous groups of statuary, known as the "Saints of Solesmes", were set up in the church. It is not known for <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> who the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> were, but the groups were probably the work of several hands. They are placed in the two <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transeptal</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and form one of the chief attractions of the place. One represents the entombment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> and the other various episodes of the Dolours of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. The groups contain eight and fifteen life-size figures respectively, besides various subsidiary figures, and are adorned with <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a> and other sculptural ornamentation. Some of the faces, notably that of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>, are wonderfully expressive; that of <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a> is supposed to be a portrait of King Ren&eacute; (d. 1480). In the sixteenth century these masterpieces were in danger of being destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> and other Iconoclasts, but the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> saved them by erecting barricades. Jean Bougler was the last Regular Prior of Solesmes, a succession of <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory priors</a> being appointed after his death. In 1664 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was absorbed by the <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Congregation of St. Maur</a>, and in 1722 it was, with the exception of the church, entirely rebuilt on a larger scale. In 1791 it was suppressed and the buildings passed into private hands, so remaining for forty years. In 1831 the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was put up for sale, and <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Prosper Gu&eacute;ranger</a>, then a young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of twenty-seven, who had been born in the neighborhood and had long lamented its state of <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> was inspired to acquire it and restore it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a home of monastic life. He set about raising the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> funds, bought the entire <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and, with five other like-minded <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, took possession in 1833. Three years later, with the full approval of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, they commenced <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">the Benedictine life</a>. In 1837 <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> was professed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and a few months later <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> raised Solesmes to the rank of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, naming <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and formally erecting at the same time the new "Congregation of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>" with Solesmes as the mother-house and its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> as superior-general. In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> daughterhouses have been founded from Solesmes, viz: Ligug&eacute; (1853), Silos in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1880), Glanfeuil (1892), and Fontanelle (1893), these four being old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> restored; also new foundations at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> (1865), Farnborough in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and Wisque (1895), <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1893), and Kergonan (1897). Since its restoration Solesmes has been dissolved by the French Government no less than four times. In 1880, 1882, and 1883 the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were ejected by force but, receiving hospitality in the neighbourhood, succeeded each time in re-entering their <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. At the final expulsion in 1903 they were, like all the other religious of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave the country. Between the years 1890 and 1900 an entirely new and imposing <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> had been added to the existing buildings, which had become too small for the growing community. Hardly, however, had the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> got settled in it when they were driven forth. They then established themselves in the Isle of Wight, where, after a few years' sojourn in a rented house at Appuldurcombe, they have now nearly completed the building of a new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Quarr, on what was formerly monastic <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.

<p>The community of Solesmes has achieved a worldwide reputation for its erudition and its devotion to monastic and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> studies, the foundation for which was laid by <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> himself. Amongst those who have thus brought fame to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> may be mentioned Dom Pitra, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and Librarian at the Vatican, Dom Pothier, Dom Cabrol, Dom F&eacute;rotin, Dom Mocquereau, Dom Besse, Dom Quentin, and Dom Leclercq. But the greatest work, perhaps, done by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Solesmes, and that for which they are best known, has been the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> set himself the task of resuscitating sound <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> traditions in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at a time when such were at their lowest ebb. He revived the accent and rhythm of <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plainsong</a>, which had been lost, and in restoring the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> text of the chant he laid down the principle, which has since been always strictly adhered to, that when various <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of different periods and places agreed on a version, there existed the most correct text. He entrusted the work to Dom Jansions and Dom Pothier, the latter producing his "Les M&eacute;lodies Gr&eacute;goriennes" in 1880 and the "Liber Gradualis" in 1883. These, as well as many other publications, were all printed at the Solesmes Imprimerie, which for many years was an important appanage of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Unfortunately the entire plant was confiscated by the French government at the suppression and since then the Solesmes books have been printed by Descl&eacute;e of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>. Dom Pothier followed the Reims-Cambrai edition as far as possible, so as to shelter himself under the authority it still possessed, though the still higher authority of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> an obstacle in his way. Through this desire to be conciliatory, and also the insufficiency of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, the absence of any competent check, and the want of practical preparatory trial, the earlier Solesmes editions were bound to be defective. But they served their purpose in the return to antiquity and have formed the basis for further research. Dom Pothier's pioneer labours have been followed by those of Dom Mocquereau, whose great work has been the personal training of the Solesmes <em>Schola</em>, which has greatly influenced many others, and the publication of the "Pal&eacute;ographie Musicale". By means of photographic reproductions of scores of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> from all the principal <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, a far greater degree of exactness than was possible with mere transcripts which might contain copyists' <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. These reproductions have been brought together and studied at Solesmes and the variants of the different melodies classified according to their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> or church of origin, date, etc. Intrinsic qualities also have been carefully considered in deciding on the most correct and universal version, but when these criteria have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> insufficient preference has been given to the Roman version, when there has happened to be one. This method of selection is described in detail, with examples, in the little brochure of Dom Cagin and Dom Mocquereau referred to in the bibliography. The labours of the Solesmes fathers received the highest possible recognition in 1904, when <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> (Motu Proprio, 25 April, 1904) entrusted particularly to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the French Congregation and to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Solesmes" the work of preparing an official Vatican edition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> Chant, and appointed a Commission for the purpose with Dom Pothier as its president. The Gradual has already appeared and the Antiphonal is in preparation. (See  PROSPER LOUIS PASCAL GU&Eacute;RANGER.)
