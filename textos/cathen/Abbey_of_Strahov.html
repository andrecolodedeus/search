<h1>Abbey of Strahov</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, founded in 1149 by Bishop Henry Zdik of <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>, Bishop John of Prague, and Prince Ladislaus II. A colony of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Steinfeld near <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, was brought here, and Gero, a canon of Cologne, became its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. This new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in a very short time flourished to such an extent that some of its members were soon appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Prague.

<p>During the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Strahov took keen interest in the public affairs of the kingdom, and their names are often mentioned in public documents and grants of special privileges.

<p>On 19 Oct., 1259, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was destroyed by fire, but Abbot John I (1250-66) built a new and magnificent church. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> suffered greatly during the plundering reign of the king's regent, Otto of Brandenberg and that of Henry of Carinthia. It, however, again flourished under Charles IV. On 8 May, 1420, the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> set fire to the buildings, and looted and destroyed everything. The main cause of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the fanatics against the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was that John Zelezny, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Leitomischl, a <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a>, was one of the accusers of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>.

<p>From this time onward Strahov continued to decline, and its lands were gradually <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> and sold, until in 1577 and 1578 not one of its members remained, and the meagre income was turned over tot he <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the Emperor Ferdinand I. Later a <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a>, <a href="../cathen/09331a.htm">John Lohelius</a>, who was subsequently became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, gathered <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, colonized Strahov anew, infusing into it new physical as well as spiritual life. <a href="../cathen/09331a.htm">Lohelius</a> rebuilt the church and a greater part of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and Abbot Caspar of Questenberg (1620-40) completed the work. During the bombardment of Prague in 1842 Strahov suffered greatly; the damage, however, was soon repaired. When the <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> suppressed 58 <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, Strahov was saved by a similar fate by Abbot Wenceslaus Mayer (d. 1800), who had won favour even at the hostile Court by the interest that he took in fostering <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Abbot Zikmund Stary (1879-1905) built the new church and improved the old church. The present <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Method Zavoral, is a man of great ability as a preacher.

<p>The monastic Church of the Assumption, built in 1601-1605 by <a href="../cathen/09331a.htm">Abbot Lohelius</a>, is beautifully decorated by numerous frescos; the pictures on the arched ceiling symbolize some of the invocations contained in the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">Litany</a> of the Blessed Virgin, and on the side walls are scenes from the life of St. Norbert. These beautiful frescos are the work of the Prague artist Georg Wilhelm Neuherz (d. 1743). The Chapel of St. Norbert has the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> in a casket of copper and bronze, richly gilded. The <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> is the work of the Strahov <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/09331a.htm">Lohel Oehlschl&auml;gel</a> (d. 1774).

<p>The monastic <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> contains upwards of 110,000 volumes, of which 1200 are <em>incunabula</em>. Of these there are about sixty unique volumes. Of the many rare <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> the most precious is the "Evangelistarium" of the sixth century, written in uncial letters and still well-preserved. Among others may be mentioned: "Gerlaci Chronicon", Codex Strahoviensis from 1220; the "Pontificale" of Bishop Albert of Sternberg, made in 1376; the "Missale" of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Abbey of Louky of 1480; the miniature <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> of the thirteenth century, written by a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of Doksany; "Sich's Gradual" of 1610, weighing fifty pounds. The art gallery has the original <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">D&uuml;rer's</a> "Blessed Virgin of the Rosary", of 1506, with the master's own portrait; and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Correggio, <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Dyck</a>, <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbein</a>, van Aachen, Reiner, Skr&eacute;ta, Brandl, etc.
