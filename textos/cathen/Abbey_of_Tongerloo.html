<h1>Abbey of Tongerloo</h1>  

<p>Located near <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, founded in 1128 in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, by de Giselbert, who not only gave the land, but also himself became a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> in it. The first religious were sent from St. Michael's Abbey, <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, under Henry, who had come with St. Norbert to Antwerp to extirpate the Tanchelmite <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. The charter of its foundation was signed, amongst others, by <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a> and by the Blessed Waltman, first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> granted synodal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. From very small beginnings the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> grew to be in time one of the most important in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, making its spiritual and social influence felt in a large district called Campine, now in north-east <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and south <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, then a wild district in which but scanty provision was found for the spiritual and social needs of its scattered inhabitants. Considering the scarcity of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the good done by the religious of Tongerloo, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, the chapters of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> and Maastricht, and several landowners confided the charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with the right of patronage, to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> thus it came to pass that in time the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> had to provide <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for some forty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, or small <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> residences, in these parts.

<p>With the erection of new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (1559-60) in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, heavy burdens were cast on the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, for not only had it to provide the funds, but the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Boisle-Duc was put at its head as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. This state of affairs lasted until 1590, when, to obtain its independence, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> had to give up much <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in support of the new diocese. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> had become very powerful in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and, in their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, had put many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to death. Amongst those who received the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> are reckoned three religious of Tongerloo, viz.: Arnold Vessem and Henry Bosch in 1557, and Peter Janssens in 1572. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> has always promoted <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Bishop Ophovius says that its religious were <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <em>in omni pietate et doctrina</em> and Miraeus, that it was <em>faecundum pastorum Seminarium.</em> It possessed one of the largest <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, and was able to take up the work of the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/02190d.htm">BACKX</a>; <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">PREMONSTRATENSIAN CANONS</a>, <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">BOLLANDISTS</a>.)
