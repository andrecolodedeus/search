<h1>Abbey of Waldsassen</h1>  

<p>("Settlement in the woods").

<p>Located on the River Wondreb, Upper Palatinate, near the border of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Diocese of Ratisbon</a>. This celebrated <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was founded by Gerwich von Wolmundstein, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Abbey of Sigeberg, with the permission of his former Abbot Kuno, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. Gerwich built the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (1128-32). The original community was sent to Waldsassen from Volkenrod, in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, of the line of the Abbey of Morimond. The first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was elected in 1133. Soon the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became one of the most renowned and powerful of the times. As the number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> increased, several important foundations were made: Sedlitz and Ossegg in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>; Walderbach, near <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>; etc. Several of its thirty-seven <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> up to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> were illustrious for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning; of them Herman the seventh, and John the seventeenth, as well as Gerwich, its founder, and Wigand, the first prior, are commemorated in the <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">menology</a>.

<p>From the middle of the fourteenth century Waldsassen alternated with periods of prosperity and decadence; <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, famines, excessive taxation, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> made it suffer much. During the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> War (1504) the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, church, and farm- buildings were burned, but immediately afterwards rebuilt, and the new church <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1517. A few years later part of the buildings were again destroyed during <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and beautifully restored by George III (1531-37), who was the last of the first series of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. From 1537 to 1560 administrators were appointed by <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. Frederick III, Elector Palatine, named his brother Richard, for this office. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were then forced to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a> or flee, or were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. For about a hundred years it remained in this condition, during which time it was almost totally burned in the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. After the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was restored in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. In 1669 Waldsassen was restored to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, and in 1690 Albrecht, first of the second series of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> (six in number), was elected. The buildings were sumptuously rebuilt, and the number of religious again became considerable. It became especially renowned for its hospitality, particularly during the famines of 1702-03 and 1772- 73, and during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. Under Abbot <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> (1793-1803) <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and learning were highly cultivated. When the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> fell under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of suppression in 1803 it numbered over eighty members, who were dispersed after having been granted a pension by the Crown, which confiscated all their possessions. In 1863 the remnants of the old <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> were bought by the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Nuns of Seligenthal; the following year they took possession, established <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">monastic enclosure</a>, and opened an institute for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls. Finally it was erected into a regular <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, with <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, to which many candidates have been admitted; today the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> numbers over a hundred <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>.
