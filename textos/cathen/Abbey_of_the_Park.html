<h1>Abbey of the Park</h1>  

<p>Located half a mile south of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, founded in 1129 by Duke Godfrey, surnamed "Barbatus", who possessed an immense park near <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and had invited the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertines</a> to take possession of a small church he had built there. Walter, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Martin's, Laon, brought a colony of his canons and acted as their superior for nearly three years. The canons, now in sufficient number, elected Simon, a canon of Laon, as their <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The canons performed the general work of the ministry in the district of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, bringing back those seduced by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Tanchelin (see <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">PREMONSTRATENSIAN CANONS</a>). In 1137 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was able to found the Abbey of Our Lady and SS. Cornelius and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> at Ninove. Godfrey made the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the Park and his successors his arch-chaplains, Simon (died 30 March, 1142) was succeeded by Philip whose learning and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> may be judged from his correspondence with <a href="../cathen/07351a.htm">St. Hildegard</a> in the archives of the Park Abbey. Philip and his successors enlarged the buildings and prepared the land for agriculture. At the time there was living at the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> a canon, Blessed Rabado, whose devotion to the Passion was attested by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Abbot Gerard van Goetsenhoven (1414-34) had much to do with the erection of the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, and was also delegated by Duke John to transact state affairs with the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Abbot van Tulden (1462-94) was successful in his action against commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> being imposed on <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Abbot van den Berghe (1543-58) managed the contributions levied in support of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> present at the resumed <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> frequently suffered during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> waged by William of Orange and the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, but was fortunate to have then at its head men of marked learning, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and discretion, such as Loots (1577-1583), van Vlierden (1583-1601), <a href="../cathen/05166b.htm">Druys</a> (1601-1634), Maes (1635-1647), De Pape (1648-1682), van Tuycum (1682-1702). They all favoured higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, and studies were in a flourishing state in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was confiscated, because Abbot Wauters (died 23 Nov., 1792) refused to send his religious to the general <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> erected by the emperor at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. A revolution against the emperor's injustices being successful, the religious returned to their <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Wauters was succeeded by Melchior Nysmans (1793-1810). Under the French Republic the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was confiscated again on 1 Feb., 1797. At the request of the people the church was declared to be a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church and was thus saved. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was bought by a friendly <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> who wished to preserve it for the religious, in better times. One of the canons, in the capacity of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, remained in or near the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. When <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> was made a kingdom and religious freedom restored, the surviving religious resumed the community life and elected Peter Ottoy, then rural dean of Diest, as their superior.

<p>In 1897 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> undertook the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. It counts at present (Jan., 1911) 48 religious; 8 of these are doing missionary work in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. The canons of the Park Abbey publish the following reviews: <ul><li>(1) "Analectes de l'Ordre de Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;" (four times a year); <li>(2) "Revue de l'Ordre de Pr&eacute;montr&eacute; et de ses missions" (six times a year); "'T Park's maandschrift" (monthly).</ul>
