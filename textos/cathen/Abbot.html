<h1>Abbot</h1>  

<p>A title given to the superior of a community of twelve or more <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The name is derived from <a href="../cathen/01006d.htm"><em>abba</em></a>, the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a> form of the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>ab</em>, and means "father". In <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, where it had its origin, and in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, it was first employed as a title of honour and respect, and was given to any <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of venerable age or of eminent <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. The title did not originally imply the exercise of any authority over a religious community. From the East the word passed over to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, and here it was soon received into general use to designate the superior of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In this article we shall treat: <blockquote> <br>I. Historical Origin; <br>II. Nature of the Office; <br>III. Kinds of Abbots; <br>IV. Mode of Election; <br>V. Benediction of the Abbot; <br>VI. Authority; <br>VII. Rights and Privileges; <br>VIII. Assistance at Councils; <br>IX. Distribution of Abbots. </blockquote>
<h2 id="section1">Historical origin</h2>

<p><a href="../images/01015cax.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/01015cat.jpg"></a>

<p>Monastic communities were first organized in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> at the beginning of the fourth century. St. Anthony introduced one form of community life the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> when, about the year A.D. 305, he undertook the direction and organization of the multitude of <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> who had gathered about him in the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>; a second &#151; the coenobitical, or conventual, type of <a href="../cathen/10472a.htm">monachism</a> &#151; was instituted by <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a>, who, about the same time, founded his first <em>coenobium</em>, or conventual <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, at Tabennae in the far south of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Both systems spread rapidly and were soon firmly established in Palestine, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Mesopotamia, and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. By the middle of the fourth century monachism had also made its appearance in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and here, at the beginning of the sixth, <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict of Nursia</a>, gave it the definite form and constitution which ultimately assured its triumph in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>.

<p>Every group of <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> and every <em>coenobium</em> naturally had its superior. The title given him varied. In the East he was usually styled the elder, the senior, or also father of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and among the Greeks generally he was called <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> (<em>archos</em>, a chief, and <em>mandra</em>, a fold, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>) or <em>hegumenos.</em> Originally there seems to have been no appreciable difference in the signification of these two words, but after the period of <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a> the title <em>archimandrite</em> was jealously reserved for the superiors of the older or of the more important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Both names have, however, been permanently retained, and are to this day the titles given to monastic superiors in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/03404a.htm">Cassian</a>, who at the beginning of the fifth century had transplanted <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> monachism to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, was addressed as <em>Abbas</em>, <em>Pater</em>, and <em>Dominus</em>; he himself termed the superior of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <em>Praepositus</em>. The word <em>praepositus</em>, in the signification of a monastic ruler, appears also in Roman Africa and elsewhere in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, but towards the close of the fifth century it had been almost entirely supplanted by the term <em>abbas</em>. St. Benedict, in his <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule</a>, written about 529, assigned a subordinate position in the community to the <em>praepositus</em>, and restricted the use of the title <em>abbas</em> to the superior of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Through the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of the great Patriarch of Western Monachism</a> the application of the title <em>abbas</em> was definitely fixed, and its use made general in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Nature of the office</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict's</a> conception of a monastic community was distinctly that of a spiritual <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Every individual <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> was to be a son of that <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the, Abbot its father, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> its permanent home. Upon the Abbot therefore, as upon the father of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, devolves the government and direction of those who are committed to his care, and a paternal solicitude should characterize his rule. St. Benedict says that "an abbot who is worthy to have the charge of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> ought always to remember by what title he is called," and that "in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> he is considered to represent the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, seeing that he is called by His name" (<a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, ii). The monastic system established by St. Benedict was based entirely upon the supremacy of the abbot. Though the Rule gives directions as to an abbot's government, and furnishes him with principles upon which to act, and binds him to carry out certain prescriptions as to consultation with others in difficult matters etc., the subject is told to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> without question or hesitation the decision of the superior. It is of course needless to say that this obedience did not extend to the commission of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, even were any such command ever imposed (Gasquet, <em>English Monastic Life</em>, London, 1904, p. 42). The obedience shown to the Abbot is regarded as obedience paid to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, and all the respect and reverence with which he is treated by the brethren of his house is paid him for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, because as abbot &#151; father &#151; he is the representative of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the midst of the brethren. The whole government of a religious house depends upon the Abbot. His will is supreme in all things; yet, as the Rule says, nothing is to be taught, commanded, or ordered beyond the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>. All the officials who are to assist him in the government of the house, are appointed by him and have their authority from him. He may dismiss them at his discretion. The Abbot, by virtue of his office, administers the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">temporal possessions</a> of the community, exercises a general supervision for the maintenance of monastic <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, provides for the keeping of the Rule, punishes and, if need be, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicates</a> the refractory, presides in choir during the recitation of the Office, and at Divine Service, and gives the blessings. In a word, uniting in his person the threefold office of father, teacher, and ruler, it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the Abbot to see that all things are administered wisely in the House of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Kinds of abbots</h2>

<p>An Abbot canonically elected and confirmed, and exercising the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office, is by the law of the Church styled a Regular Abbot. Regular Abbots are <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> in the full sense of the word, and their <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">dignity</a> is of three grades.

<p>An Abbot who presides only over such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, ecclesiastical and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a>, as are attached to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, belongs to the lowest grade, and his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> carries with it what is called the simple passive exemption (<em>exemptio passiva</em>) from the authority of the diocesan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>If an Abbot's jurisdiction extends beyond the limits of his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, over the inhabitants &#151; <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> &#151; of a certain district or territory which forms an integral part of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> diocese, he belongs to the middle grade (<em>praelatus quasi nullius dioecesis</em>) and his exemption is termed active (<em>exemptio activa</em>).

<p>And when an Abbot has jurisdiction over the clergy and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of a district or territory (comprising one or several cities and places) which forms no part whatever of any diocese, his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> is styled <em>vere nullius dioecesis</em> (of no diocese) and, excepting a few <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> only, for the exercise of which the <em>ordo episcopalis</em> is required, his authority is in all things equal to that of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This is the third and highest grade of the dignity.

<p>There are no <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> <em>vere nullius</em> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> or in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Among <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of this class in other countries may be mentioned: in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the arch-abbey of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, founded by St. Benedict himself about 529; the abbey of <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, of which the titular is always a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">abbey of St. Paul <em>extra Muros</em></a> (<a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>); that of <a href="../cathen/10538b.htm">Monte Vergine</a> near <a href="../cathen/02149c.htm">Avellino</a>, founded by <a href="../cathen/15639b.htm">St. William of Vercelli</a> in 1124; and the abbey of the Most Holy Trinity at Cava, dating back to 1011; in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, the abbey of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, founded about 934; in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (<a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>), the arch-abbey of St. Martin's, (<a href="../cathen/09734c.htm">Martinsberg</a>), established A.D. 1001 by St. Stephen, King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; and in West <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a> the abbey of <a href="../cathen/11005a.htm">New Norcia</a>. All exempt <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, no matter what the canonical title or degree of their <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">exemption</a>, are under the immediate jurisdiction of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The term <em>exempt</em> is, strictly speaking, not applied to an Abbot <em>nullius</em>, because his jurisdiction is entirely extraterritorial. Within the limits of his territory such an Abbot has, with few exceptions, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and assumes all a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. Abbots of the second grade, however, whose authority (though quasi-episcopal) is intra-territorial, cannot be considered ordinaries, nor can they lay any claim to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, excepting those, of course, which have been especially granted them by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.



<p>When the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in which the same regular observance is followed, or the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of the same province, district, or country form a congregation, i.e. a federation of houses to promote the general interest of the order, the presiding Abbot is styled the "Abbot President", or the "Abbot General." Thus, the Cassinese Congregation of the Primitive Observance has at its head an Abbot General; the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> Congregation, the American-Cassinese, and the American-<a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>, have each an Abbot President. The authority of the Abbot President is defined in the statutes or constitution of each congregation. In the recent confederation of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> all the Black Monks of St. Benedict were united under the presidency of an "Abbot Primate" (<a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, <em>Summum semper</em>, 12 July, 1893); but the unification, fraternal in its nature, brought no modification to the abbatial dignity, and the various congregations preserved their autonomy intact. The powers of the Abbot Primate are specified, and his position defined, in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars dated 16 September, 1893. The primacy is attached to the Abbey and International Benedictine College of St. Anselm, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the Primate, who takes precedence of all other Abbots, is empowered to pronounce on all doubtful matters of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, to settle difficulties arising between <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> to hold a <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a>, if necessary, in any congregation of the order, and to exercise a general supervision for the regular observance of monastic <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>. Of late, however, certain branches of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> seem to have lost their original autonomy to some extent. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Reformed Cistercians of La Trappe</a>, for instance, are by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, 8 May, 1892, placed under the authority of an Abbot-General. The Abbot-General has full authority to pass decision upon all current affairs and difficulties. On account of the antiquity or the preeminence of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> over which they preside, the honorary title of Arch-abbot is bestowed upon the superiors of certain <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, "the Cradle of Western Monachism", <a href="../cathen/09734c.htm">St. Martinsberg</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, St. Martin's of Beuron, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and St. Vincent's, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> foundation in America, are presided over by Arch-abbots.

<p>A further variety of Abbots-Regular are the "Titular Abbots." A Titular Abbot holds the title of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> which has been either destroyed or suppressed, but he exercises none of the functions of an Abbot, and has <em>in actu</em> no subjects belonging to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> whence he derives his title. The law of the Church recognizes also "Secular Abbots," i.e. <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who, though not professed members of any monastic order, nevertheless possess an abbacy as an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a>, with the title and some of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a> of the office. These <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> belonged originally to monastic houses, but on the suppression of the abbeys the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> and the title were transferred to other churches. There are various classes of Secular Abbots; some have both jurisdiction and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to use the pontifical insignia; others have only the abbatical dignity without either jurisdiction or the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <em>pontificalia</em>; while yet another class holds in certain <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a> the first dignity and the privilege of precedence in choir and in assemblies, by reason of some suppressed or destroyed conventual church now become the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the title Abbot was borne not only by the superiors of religious houses, but also by a number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, ecclesiastical and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a>, who had no connection whatever with the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic system</a>. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, for instance, employed it in his day to designate the principal of a body of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> attached to certain churches; and later, under the Merovingians and Carlovingians, it was applied to the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the royal household, <em>Abbas Palatinus</em>, and to the military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the king, <em>Abbas Castrenisis</em>. From the time of <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> onward to the eleventh century it came to be adopted even by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, the <em>Abbacomites</em>, or <em>Abbates Milites</em>, mostly nobles dependent on the court, or old officers, to whom the sovereign would assign a portion of the revenues of some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> as a reward for military service. "Commendatory Abbots" (secular <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who held an abbacy not <em>in titulo</em>, but <em>in commendam</em>) had their origin in the system of commendation prevalent during the eighth and succeeding centuries. They were in the first instance merely temporary trustees, appointed to administer the estates of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> during a <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacancy</a>; but in the course of time they retained the office for life, and claimed a portion of the revenues for their maintenance. The practice of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominating</a> Commendatory Abbots eventually led to serious abuses; it was greatly checked by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and has in modern times entirely disappeared from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Mode of election</h2>

<p>In the early days of monastic institutions the founder of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious house</a> was usually its first superior; in every other instance the Abbot was appointed or elected. Some Abbots indeed selected their own successors, but the cases were exceptional. In many places, when a vacancy occurred, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> would choose a superior from among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, but it appears that from the very beginning the appointment of an Abbot rested generally with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> themselves. St. Benedict <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> (Rule, lxiv) that the Abbot should be chosen "by the general consent of the whole community, or of a small part of the community, provided its choice were made with greater wisdom and discretion." The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the Abbots and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men of the neighbourhood were called upon to oppose the election of an unworthy man. Every religious house professing his Rule adopted the method prescribed by the great monastic legislator, and in the course of time the right of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> their own Abbot came to be generally recognized, particularly so when it had been solemnly confirmed by the canons of the Church see <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, Vetus et Nova Eccl. Disciplina, Pt. I, III, c. xxxii, no. 6). But during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, when <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> had grown wealthy and powerful, kings and princes gradually encroached on the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, until in most countries the sovereign had wholly usurped the power of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominating</a> abbots for many of the greater houses in his realm. This interference of the court in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> was in the process of time the source of many evils and the occasion of grave disorders, while in its effect on monastic <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> it was uniformly disastrous. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> were finally restored by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. According to the present legislation, the Abbot is elected for life by the secret suffrages of the community's <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a> members <em>in sacris.</em> To be eligible he must have all the qualifications required by the canons of the Church. It is furthermore necessary that he should be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, a professed member of the order, of legitimate birth, and at least twenty-five years of age. The election, to be valid, must be held in the manner prescribed by the common law of the Church (cf. Quia propter. &#151; De elect., I, 6; and Cone. Trid., sess. XXV, c. vi, De reg.), and as determined in the statutes or constitutions of each congregation. In the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> and American congregations the Abbot of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is elected for life by a two-thirds vote of the professed members in <em>sacris</em> of the chapter. The Abbots themselves elect the abbot president. Exempt <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> under the immediate jurisdiction of the Pope must, within the space of a month, apply to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for a confirmation of the election; non-exempt houses, within three months, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The confirmation confers upon the Abbot-elect the <em>jus in re</em>, and having obtained it he enters at once upon the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and privileges of his office. A canonical perpetuity attaches to the abbatial dignity; <em>semel abbas, semper abbas</em>; and even after a resignation the dignity endures, and the title is retained. <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in the United States and in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> enjoy exemption; for America, the newly-elected Abbots are confirmed directly by the Pope; in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, however, according to the recent Constitution, "Diu quidem est" (1899), they are confirmed by the Abbot President in the name of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.
<h2 id="section5">Benediction of the abbot</h2>

<p>After his ecclesiastical confirmation, the newly elected Abbot is solemnly blessed according to the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> prescribed in the <a href="../cathen/12231a.htm">"Pontificale Romanum"</a> (<em>De benedictione Abbatis</em>). By the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, Commissi Nobis, 6 May, 1725, all Regular Abbots elected for life are now <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to receive this blessing (or, at least, to thrice formally request it) within the space of a year, from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; if they fail to have the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> performed within the required time, they incur <em>ipso jure</em> a <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a> from office for the period of one year. Should the petition be refused for the third time, either by the diocesan or the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, an Abbot is free to receive benediction from any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Constitution at the same time expressly declares that the Abbot-elect may licitly and validly perform all the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office during the interval preceding his solemn benediction. It must be noted, however, that the legislation enforced by <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> does not affect those Abbots who are <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileged</a> to receive the blessing from their regular superiors, nor those who by their election and confirmation are <em>ipso facto</em> regarded as blessed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. The blessing is not <em>in se</em> essential for the exercise of an Abbot's order and office; it confers no additional jurisdiction, and imparts no sacramental <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>. An Abbot <em>nullius</em> may call upon any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to bestow the abbatial blessing. By the recent Constitution of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, "Diu quidem est." 1899, the Abbots of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> Congregation are bound within six months of their election to present themselves to the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to be blessed by Apostolical authority; and, if the diocesan be prevented, they can receive the blessing from any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>The ceremony, which in solemnity differs but slightly from that of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, takes place during the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, after the Epistle. The essentials of the episcopal order are of course omitted, but before his benediction the Abbot takes the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and, like the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, is subjected to a canonical examination. He receives the insignia of his office &#151; the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a>, etc. &#151; from the hands of the officiating <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, and at the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> presents to him two small casks of <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, two loaves of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a>, and two large wax <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">tapers</a>; he says the Mass with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and receives <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> from him. During the singing of the <em>Te Deum</em> the newly blessed Abbot, with <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, is conducted through the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of the church by the two assistant Abbots, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the people. Upon his returning to his seat in the sanctuary (if in his own church), the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the community come, one by one, and, <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">kneeling</a> before their new superior, pay him their homage, and receive from him the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>. The ceremony is concluded by a solemn blessing bestowed by the newly <a href="../cathen/08050a.htm">installed</a> Abbot standing at the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">High Altar</a>. According to the Pontificale Romanum, the day set apart for the function ought to be a <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> or a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a>. The solemn rite of benediction, once conferred, need not be again received when an Abbot is translated from one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to another.
<h2 id="section6">Authority of the abbot</h2>

<p>The authority of an Abbot is of two; kinds, one relating to the external government of the house, the other to the spiritual government of his subjects. The first is a paternal or domestic authority, based on the nature of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and on the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience, the second a power of quasi-episcopal jurisdiction, by virtue of which he is truly a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>.

<p>His domestic authority empowers the Abbot to administer the property of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, to maintain the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> of the house, to compel the religious, even by penalties, to observe the Rule and the Constitutions of the Order, and to ordain whatever else may be essential for the preservation of peace and order in the community.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a> which the Abbot possesses, both <em>in foro interno</em> and <em>in foro externo</em>, authorizes him to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> his subjects from all cases of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> not specially reserved, and to <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegate</a> this power to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; to <a href="../cathen/12784a.htm">reserve</a> to himself the eleven cases enumerated in the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, "Ad futuram rei memoriam"; to inflict <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">ecclesiastical censures</a>; and to <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispense</a> the members of his house in certain cases for which a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is usually obtained from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He cannot, of course, dispense a religious from the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and obedience.

<p>Abbots, like the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> over whom they ruled, were originally <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. It was not long, however, before they were enrolled in the ranks of the clergy. Towards the close of the fifth century by far the greater number of Abbots in the East had received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. The change was effected more slowly in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, but even here few were found at the end of the seventh century who had not been clothed with the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. A council held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 826, under <a href="../cathen/05598b.htm">Pope Eugene II</a>, enjoined the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of Abbots, but the canon seems not to have been rigidly enforced, for as late as the eleventh century we read of some who were only <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. The Council of Poitiers (1078) finally obliged all Abbots under pain of deprivation to receive <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders. (<a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, Pt. I, I, iii, <em>passim.</em>) From this time forward the power and influence of Abbots steadily increased in Church and State, until towards the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> their position was everywhere regarded as one of the highest distinction. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> eleven Abbots held rank as princes of the Empire, and with all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of princes took part in the deliberation of the Diets. The Abbots of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> exercised even sovereign power over ten square miles round the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>

<blockquote>abbots formed the bulk of the spiritual peerage. The position held by them throughout every part of the country gave yet a further weight to their great position as noblemen and local magnates. As such they went <em>pari passu</em> with baron or earl of the noblest lineage. On the blazoned Roll of the Lords, the <a href="../cathen/13046c.htm">Lord Richard Whiting</a> and the Lord Hugh Farringdon (Abbots of Glastonbury and of Reading) went hand in hand with a Howard and a Talbot [Gasquet, Henry VIII and the English Monast. (London, 1888), I, 25].</blockquote>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> their power and influence were equally great, and continued so generally up to the time of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>.
<h2 id="section7">Rights and privileges</h2>

<p>All <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> Abbots have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to give the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and to confer <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> on the professed members of their house. As early as 787 the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicaea</a> permitted Abbots (provided they were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and had received the solemn rite of benediction) to give the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and to advance their <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to the order of <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> (<a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, Pt., I. c., I. iii, c. xvii, no. 3). The privilege granted by this Council was gradually extended until it embraced <em>all</em> the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, and in the course of time Abbots were authorized to confer them not only on their <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> but also on their secular subjects [Wernz, Jus Decretalium (Rome, 1899) ii, 47, note]. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, however, decreed that "it shall not henceforth be lawful for abbots, . . . howsoever exempted, . . . to confer the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> on any but their <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> subjects, nor shall the said abbots grant letters dimissory to any <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clerics</a> to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by others" [Can. et Decret. Conc. Trid. (ed. Richter et Schulte), p. 197]. From this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Council it is quite clear that Abbots still have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to confer the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, but it is equally clear that they may confer them lawfully only on their <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> subjects. Novices, therefore, <a href="../cathen/11188a.htm">oblates</a>, <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regulars</a> of another order or congregation, and seculars cannot be advanced by the Abbot. Even the Abbots styled <em>vere nullius</em>, who exercise an episcopal jurisdiction in their territory, may not without a special privilege give <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> to their secular subjects [Santi, Praelect. Jur. Can. (New York, 1898), I, 125 sq., and Can. et Decret. Cone. Trid. (ed. Richter et Schulte), 197 sq., where also the decisions of the Sacred Cong. of the Council on this subject may be found]. On the question of the validity of orders conferred by an Abbot who goes beyond the limits of the faculties extended by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, canonists disagree. Some pronounce such orders absolutely invalid, others maintain that they are illicitly conferred but nevertheless valid. The opinion of the latter seems to be sustained by various decisions of the Sacred Cong. of the Council (Santi, op. cit., p. 128 sq.; cf. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, De Syn. Dioec. II, c. xi, no. 13). It is a much-disputed question whether Abbots have ever been permitted to confer the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>. Many canonists hold that the subdiaconate, being of merely ecclesiastical institution, was formerly amounted one of the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> of the Church, and infer that before the time of <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> (1099), Abbots could have given that order. But the further claim that Abbots have also conferred the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> cannot, apparently, be sustained, for the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, "Exposcit tuae devotionis" (9 April, 1489), in which this privilege is said to have been granted to certain <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbots, makes no reference whatever to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> &#151; "Fact&acirc; inspectione in Archivis (Vaticani) . . . bulla quidem ibidem est reperta, sed mentio de diaconatu in e&acirc;dem deest." [See Gasparri, Tract. can. de S. Ordinatione, II, n. 798; cf. also P. Pie de Langogne, "Bulle d'Innocent VIII aux abb&eacute;s de C&icirc;teaux pour les ordinations in sacris" (Etudes franciscaines, f&eacute;v., 1901, 129 sq.)] Pauh&ouml;lzl, in "Studien und Mittheil. aus dem Benedictiner und Cistercienser-Orden", 1884, I, 441 sq. gives the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> and defends its authenticity. By the law of the Church Abbots may grant letters dimissorial to their <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> subjects, authorizing and recommending them for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, but they cannot give dimissorials to seculars without incurring <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a>. Abbots are furthermore privileged to dedicate their <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church and the cemetery of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and authorized to reconcile them in case of desecration. They can <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">church vestments</a>, altar linens, ciboria, <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrances</a>, etc., for their own subjects, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altars</a> and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a> for their own churches. As <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, they hold the rank immediately after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, being preceded only by the <em>protonotarii participantes</em> (<em>see</em> CURIA ROMANA), and by the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. It may be added that the Abbots <em>nullius dioecesis</em> are <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> by the Pope in a public consistory, and that, within the territory over which they exercise jurisdiction, their name, like that of a diocesan, is inserted in the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">canon of the Mass</a>.

<p>The use of the pontifical insignia &#151; <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a>, ring, <a href="../cathen/06589a.htm">gloves</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13434a.htm">sandals</a> &#151; which Abbots commonly have, is one of their most ancient privileges. It cannot be definitely ascertained when the privilege was first granted, but as early as 643 the Abbey of Bobbio in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> is said to have obtained a constitution from <a href="../cathen/14570a.htm">Pope Theodore</a> confirming a grant made to the Abbot by <a href="../cathen/07452b.htm">Honorius I</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the pontifical insignia were assigned first to the Abbot of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a>, <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, in 1063 and nearly a hundred years later to the Abbot of St. Alban's. The privilege was gradually extended to other <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> until, at the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, every monastic house of importance in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was presided over by a mitred Abbot. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Abbots to <em>pontificalia</em> are now regulated by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Pope Alexander VII</a> (S. Cong. of Rites, 27 September, 1659). By the terms of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> the days on which an Abbot is permitted to pontificate are limited to three days in the year. The use of the seventh <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candle</a>, customary at a solemn <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a>, is forbidden. The Abbot's <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> is to be made of less costly material than a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">pastoral staff</a> is to be used with a white pendant <a href="../cathen/15321c.htm">veil</a>. The Abbot is not to have a permanent <a href="../cathen/14709a.htm">throne</a> in his monastic church, but is allowed, only when celebrating pontifically, to have a movable throne on two steps and a simple canopy. He has also the privilege of using <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> whenever the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">ritual</a> functions require them. As a mark of special distinction, some Abbots are permitted by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to use the <em>cappa magna</em>, and all abbots <em>nullius</em> may wear a violet <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a> and <em><a href="../cathen/15765b.htm">zucchetto</a>.</em> "A recent <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the S.C.R. (13 June, 1902) has regulated in accordance with former legislation the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the abbots of the English Congregation to <em>pontificalia.</em> According to this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> abbots can celebrate pontifically not only in their own abbatial churches, but also without the leave of the diocesan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in all other churches served by their <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> with <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>. They can also give leave to other abbots of their Congregation to pontificate in their churches. They can use the prelatical dress i.e. <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a>, <em>mozzetta</em> and <em><a href="../cathen/09611a.htm">mantelletta</a></em> outside their own churches" [<a href="../cathen/14466a.htm">Taunton</a>, The Law of the Church (London, 1906), p. 3]. The Abbots of the American-Cassinese and of the American-Swiss Congregations have the same privileges.
<h2 id="section8">Assistance at councils</h2>

<p>Ecclesiastical councils were attended by Abbots at a very early period. Thus, in 448, twenty-three <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrites</a> or Abbots assisted at that held by <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, and with thirty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> signed the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under the Merovingian kings, they frequently appeared at ecclesiastical synods as the delegates of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, while in <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Saxon England</a> and in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the presence of monastic superiors at the councils of the Church was nothing uncommon. Their attendance did not, however, become a general practice in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> until after the Eighth Council of Toledo (653) where ten Abbots had been present, and had subscribed to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> by virtue of their pastoral charge. From the eighth century onward Abbots had a voice also in the &oelig;cumenical councils of the Church. It must be remarked that in later centuries Abbots were invited to assist at such <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">councils</a> and were permitted to give a decisive vote, mainly because they too, like the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, exercised a <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. In this connection <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Pope Benedict XIV</a> says: "Item sciendum est quod quando in Conciliis generalibus soli episcopi habebant vocem definitivam, hoc fuit quia habebant administrationem populi . . . Postea additi fuere Abbates e&acirc;dem de caus&acirc;, et quia habebant administrationem subjectorum (De Syn. dioec. XIII, c. ii, no. 5). A newly appointed Abbot, before he receives the solemn benediction at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> takes an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that he will discharge faithfully all the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office, specifying among others that of attending councils: "Vocatus ad synodum, veniam, nisi praepeditus fuero canonica praepeditione" (Pontif. Rom., <em>De Benedictione Abbatis</em>). In the performance of this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> the Abbot must be guided by the regulations of the sacred canons. According to the present practice of the Church all Abbots <em>nullius dioecesis</em>, or with quasi-episcopal jurisdiction, have a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to assist at &oelig;cumenical councils. They have moreover, the right of a decisive vote, and may subscribe to the decrees. The Abbots-President of congregations and the abbots-general of an entire order are also present and cast a decisive vote, though only by virtue of privilege. Other classes of Abbots were not admitted to the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in 1870. In <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> and in plenary or national councils the Abbots <em>nullius</em> have <em>de jure</em> a decisive vote, and sign the decrees after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Attendance at these <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> is for them not merely a right, but also an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. By the terms of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, De ref., c. ii) they are obliged, "like the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are not subject to any <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, to make choice of some neighbouring metropolitan, at whose synods they shall be bound to appear," and they are further directed "to observe and to cause to be observed whatsoever shall be therein <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>." Though other Abbots must not be called <em>de jure</em> to provincial or to national councils, it is yet the custom, in most countries, to invite also the mitred Abbots who have actual jurisdiction only over their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Thus, at the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1866) both the Abbot of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> and the Abbot-President of the American-Cassinese <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> were present, and signed the decrees. At the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore (1884) six mitred Abbots assisted, two of whom, the Abbots-President of the American-Cassinese and of the American-Swiss Congregations of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, exercised the right of a decisive vote, while the other four had only a consultative voice and subscribed to the decrees merely as assenting, not as defining. And this is the practice of the Church generally. Exempt Abbots have no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to attend diocesan synods.
