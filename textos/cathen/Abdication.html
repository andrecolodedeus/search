<h1>Abdication</h1>  

<p>Abdication, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastically</a> considered, is the resignation of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> or <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">clerical dignity</a>.

<p>Every such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> or emolument, from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne to the humblest <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a>, may be resigned by the incumbent. The general ecclesiastical law concerning such abdications (exclusive of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> resignation) is that the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> must be resigned into the hands of the proper <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior. Moreover, the resignation must be prompted by a just cause, be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and free from <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contracts</a> involving <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. Resignations, however, may be made with accompanying stipulations, such as that the resigned <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> be bestowed upon a designated <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or that the abdicating <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> be provided with another office. It is also required that the one who resigns his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, if in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacred orders</a>, should have other certain means of support commensurate with his <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">dignity</a>.

<p>Resignations may be not only express but also tacit. The latter is presumed to have taken place when a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> accepts an office or commits an <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> incompatible with the holding of an <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">solemn profession</a> in a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, enrolment in the army, contracting marriage, and the like.

<p>No resignation takes effect until it is <a href="../cathen/01094b.htm">accepted</a> by the proper authority. Hence, those who hold office from a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must resign into his hands and obtain his acquiescence. <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishops</a>, in like manner, must resign into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicars-general</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/01094b.htm">accept</a> resignations unless they receive powers <em>ad hoc</em> from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. When a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> abdicates his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, he may renounce both the episcopal <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> and dignity or only the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. If he resigns both he cannot in future perform any episcopal functions, even with the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> where he resides. If he resigns, however, only the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, and not the dignity, he still remains capable of performing such episcopal functions as other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may request him to exercise. Of course, in the former case, if an abdicated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should nevertheless <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordain</a> candidates, such action would be valid, as his episcopal character is indelible, but it would be entirely illicit and entail grave consequences both for ordainer and ordained.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> abdication of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> goes into effect as soon as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> has <a href="../cathen/01094b.htm">accepted</a> it in a <a href="../cathen/04285a.htm">papal consistory</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> then becomes <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, but the actions of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> retain their validity until he receives official notice of the <a href="../cathen/01094b.htm">acceptance</a> of his resignation.

<p>Like every other <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne may also be resigned. The reasons which make it lawful for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to abdicate his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> or utility of his particular church, or the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, apply in a stronger manner to the one who governs the universal church.

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> has no superior on earth into whose hands he can resign his dignity, yet he himself by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power can dissolve the spiritual marriage between himself and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. A <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> abdication made without cause may be illicit, but it is unquestionably valid, since there is no one who can prohibit it ecclesiastically and it contravenes no <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> does not, like the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, imprint an indelible character on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and hence by his <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> abdication the Pope is entirely stripped of all <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, just as by his <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/01094b.htm">acceptance</a> of the election to the <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a> he acquired it.

<p>All <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the legitimacy of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> abdications and all disputes among canonists were put an end to by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Pope Boniface VIII</a> which was received into the <a href="../cathen/04391a.htm"><em>Corpus Juris Canonici</em></a> (Cap. Quoniam I, de renun., in 6). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pontiff</a> says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our predecessor, <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Pope Celestine V</a>, whilst he governed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, constituted and <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decreed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> can freely resign. Therefore lest it happen that this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statute</a> should in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> fall into oblivion, or that <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> upon the subject should lead to further disputes, We have determined with the counsel of our brethren that it be placed among other <a href="../cathen/04320a.htm">constitutions</a> for a perpetual memory of the same. </p></blockquote>

<p><a href="../cathen/06048a.htm">Ferraris</a> declares that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> should make his abdication into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>, as to that body alone pertains the election of his successor. For whilst it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> did not bestow the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> upon him, yet they designated him as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of Peter</a>, and they must be absolutely <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he has renounced the dignity before they can validly proceed to the election of another <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontiff</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church history</a> furnishes a number of examples of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> abdications. Leaving aside the obscure case of <a href="../cathen/09637d.htm">Pope Marcellinus</a> (296-308) adduced by Pezzani, and the still more <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> resignation of <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a> (352-366) which some historians have postulated in order to solve the perplexing position of <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Pope Felix II</a>, we may proceed to unquestioned abdications.

<p><a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Pope Benedict IX</a> (1033-44), who had long caused <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by his disorderly life, freely renounced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontificate</a> and took the habit of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. He repented of his abdication and seized the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne again for a short time after the death of <a href="../cathen/04017a.htm">Pope Clement II</a>, but he finally died in a private station.

<p>His immediate successor, <a href="../cathen/06791b.htm">Pope Gregory VI</a> (1044-46) furnishes another example of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> abdication. It was <a href="../cathen/06791a.htm">Gregory</a> who had persuaded <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> to resign the <a href="../cathen/03551e.htm">Chair of Peter</a>, and to do so he had <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bestowed valuable possessions</a> upon him. After <a href="../cathen/06791a.htm">Gregory</a> had himself become Pope, this transaction was looked on by many as <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a>; and although <a href="../cathen/06791a.htm">Gregory's</a> intentions seem to have been of the best, yet it was deemed better that he too should abdicate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity, and he did so <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>.</p>

<p>The classic example of the resignation of a Pope is that of <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">St. Celestine V</a> (1294). Before his election to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontificate</a>, he had been a simple <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, and his sudden elevation found him unprepared and unfit for his exalted position. After five months of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontificate</a>, he issued a solemn <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> in which he declared that it was permissible for the Pope to abdicate, and then made an equally solemn <a href="../cathen/12774a.htm">renunciation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. He lived two years after his abdication in the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which afterwards procured his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. Owing to the troubles which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> minded <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> caused his successor, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, by their theories about the impossibility of a valid abdication of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a> issued the above-cited <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to put the matter at rest for all time.

<p>The latest instance of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> resignation is that of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Pope Gregory XII</a> (1406-15). It was at the time of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Great Schism of the West</a>, when two <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">pretenders to the Chair of Peter</a> disputed <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory's</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a>, and rent the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> into three so-called "obediences". To put an end to the strife, the legitimate <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Pope Gregory</a> renounced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontificate</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">General Council of Constance</a> in 1415.

<p>It is well known that <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a> (1800-23), before setting out for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to crown <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> in 1804, had signed an abdication of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne to take effect in case he were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (<a href="../cathen/10544b.htm">De Montor</a>).

<p>Finally, a valid abdication of the Pope must be a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, hence a forced resignation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> would be null and void, as more than one <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">ecclesiastical decree</a> has declared.
