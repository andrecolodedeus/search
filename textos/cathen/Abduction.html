<h1>Abduction</h1>  

<p>Abduction may be considered as a public crime and a matrimonial diriment <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediment</a>. Viewed as a <em>crime</em>, it is a carrying off by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, physical or moral, of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or even man, from a free and safe place to another place morally different and neither free nor safe from the captor's power, with intent to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a> her or to gratify <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Abduction considered as a <em>matrimonial impediment</em> is a violent taking away of any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whatsoever, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chaste</a> or unchaste, from a place free and safe to a morally different place, and there detaining her in the power of her abductor until he has coerced her into <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consenting</a> to marry him.

<p>Abduction as a crime is of wider scope than is the impediment, inasmuch as the former includes man-captors and intent to gratify <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, both of which are excluded from the scope of the impediment. On the other hand, the impediment is of wider import than the crime in as far as it includes all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, chaste as well as unchaste, while the crime excludes the corrupt. This difference arises from the fact that the State aims to suppress the public crime as a menace to the safety of the commonwealth, while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cares, directly and immediately, for the freedom and the dignity of the Sacrament of Marriage.

<p>Abduction is often divided into Abduction by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">Violence</a> (<em>Raptus Violentiae</em>) and Abduction by <a href="../cathen/13679c.htm">Seduction</a>, or Elopement (<em>Raptus Seductionis</em>). The former is when
<ul>
<li>a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> evidently reluctant, and not consenting either to the flight or to the marriage, is forcibly transferred with a matrimonial intent from a secure and free place to a morally different one and there held under the abductor's influence by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, physical or moral, i.e. threats, great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, or <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> equivalent to force, as it is a well-known axiom that "it is equal to be compelled to do a thing as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is possible to be compelled to do it"
<li>a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> enticed by fair words and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and deception consents to go with a man for other reason than <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">matrimony</a> from one place to another where he detains her by force or <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> equivalent to force, in order to coerce her into a marriage to which she objects
<li>a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who, although she had already consented to a future marriage by act of <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>, yet strenuously objects to abduction, is carried off <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> by her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> or his agents from a free and safe place to another morally different and there detained until she consents to marry him. Some deny, however, that the raptor in this case is guilty of abduction, saying that he has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to his <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>. He has, indeed, a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to compel her to fulfil her engagement by <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">public authority</a>, not, however, by private authority. His carrying off of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> against her will is the exercise of private authority, and therefore <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to her <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>.</ul>

<p>Abduction by Seduction (<em>Raptus Seductionis</em>), or Elopement, is the taking away from one place to another, by a man, of</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of age or under age who consents to both the flight and the marriage without consent of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> or <a href="../cathen/07051a.htm">guardians</a>; or
<li>a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who, although she refuses at first, finally, induced thereto by caresses, flattery, or any allurement, not however equivalent to force, physical or moral, consents to both flight and marriage without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or consent of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> or guardians.</ul>

<p>Abduction by seduction, as defined is held by <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> to be abduction by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> can be offered to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> simultaneously, or to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> alone, or to the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and guardians alone; and in the elopement, while no <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is done to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is done to the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> or guardians. On the contrary, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not consider <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> done to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> done only to the parties matrimonially interested. Hence, elopement, or abduction by seduction, does not induce an impediment diriment. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, in his letter to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a> (26 June, 1805), pronounced this kind of abduction no abduction in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> sense. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> considers it, indeed, a wrong against <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> authority, but not a wrong to the abducted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</p>

<p>The old <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> (<em>Jus Vetus</em>), mindful of the actual or imaginary "Rape of the Sabines", dealt leniently with woman-stealers. If the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was willing, her marriage with her abductor was allowed and solemnized by the lictor leading her by the hand to the home of the raptor. <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, to protect <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> virtue and safeguard the State, forbade (A.D. 320) such marriages. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was neither universally received nor observed. The <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian</a> (A.D. 528, 533, and 548) forbade these marriages and fixed the punishment, for the principal and his <a href="../cathen/01100a.htm">accomplices</a> in the crime, at death and confiscation of all their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Legal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to avenge the crime was given to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, relations, or guardians; to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to instant death</a> the abductor caught in the act of Abduction. Appeal by the victim in behalf of her abductor, on the plea that she gave consent, was denied. The law awarded the confiscated <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, if she had not consented to the abduction; to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, if they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, or adverse to, it, and their daughter consented to the abduction; but if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> consented to the carrying off, then all the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> lapsed to the State, and the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were banished (Codex Just., IX, Tit. xiii; Auth. Collat., IX, Tit. xxvi; Novell., 143; Auth. Collat., IX, Tit. xxxiii; Novell. 150).

<p>The Byzantine Emperor, Leo VI (886-912), called the Philosopher, approved (Constit. XXXV) the former <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in all particulars, with the exception that if swords or other deadly weapons were carried by the abductor and his accomplices during the abduction a much severer punishment was inflicted than if they were not carried. The old Spanish law condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> the abductor who also ravished the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but the abductor who did not ravish was let off with a money fine to be equally shared by the abducted and the State. If the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had consented to the abduction, the whole fine reverted to the State. Athenian law commanded the abductor to marry the abducted, if she so willed, unless the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> or her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> or guardians had already received money instead. The earlier Byzantine law enjoined, but the later law forbade, the marriage. Among the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germanic</a> nations the crime of abduction was compounded by pecuniary gifts to the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> or guardians.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> did not accept the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> which declared all the marriages of the abductor with the abducted, without exception, entirely and perpetually null and void. She held as valid all marriages in which there was present <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and real consent of the captured <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (2 Canonical Epist. to St. Amphilochius, xxii, xxx, fixed date, an. 375, Post-Nicene Fathers, 2d series, VIII, Scribner's ed.), the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> issued no canons on abduction prior to his time.



<p>Such a crime was, doubtless, extremely rare among the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In the fourth century, as men grew more audacious, the number of wife-captors became exceedingly numerous. To check this, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in several particular councils, besides the punishment of service, confiscation of goods, and public penance, <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decreed</a> <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (to be judicially pronounced) against <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposition</a> from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rank against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, who had <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> carried off, or helped to carry off, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. <a href="../cathen/06407a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a> (496) permitted the marriage of the abductor with his captive if she was willing, and they had been <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, or had mutually discussed their future marriage prior to the abduction. Antecedent to the ninth century, however, the canons make no mention of abduction (<em>raptus</em>) as a matrimonial impediment, either diriment or impedient. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, at least from the ninth century, the marriage of the captor with his captive, or any other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, was perpetually prohibited. This was not, however, the universal <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">church discipline</a>, but rather the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> peculiar to those nations among whom the absence of strict <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> made abductions more numerous. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> nation felt the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of severe legislation to meet the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and therefore, in many particular councils, e.g. Aix-la-Chapelle (817), Meaux (845), etc., issued stringent canons which continued as the peculiar law of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> until it was abolished by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. Furthermore, the impediment was impedient, not diriment (according to the most common opinion). Marriages celebrated in opposition to the prohibition were held to be valid, although illicit. The Council of Meaux (845) forbade the abductor ever to marry the rapt <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but permitted his marriage with any other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> after he had performed the prescribed public penance. Gratian ("Decretum Caus.", XXXVI, quaest. ii, ad finem) inaugurated a milder <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>. He, relying upon the (supposed) authority of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, taught that an abductor ought to be allowed to marry the abducted, provided she was willing to have him for a husband.

<p>After the publication of his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> in the twelfth century, this milder <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> was generally observed and met with the approval of many <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Finally, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> ("Decret. Greg.", lib. V, tit. xvii, cap. vii, "De Raptoribus") decreed for the universal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (especially aiming at the perpetual prohibition by the particular councils) that such marriages might take place as often as a prior reluctance and dissent on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should change to willingness and consent to the marriage, and this (according to the common interpretation) even if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was in the power of the captor at the time she consented. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> practically did away with the impedient impediment of abduction, which was merged into the impediment of <em>vis et metus</em>. The <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocentian</a> law continued to be the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> up to the sixteenth century.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> introduced an entirely new <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>. To guard the liberty and dignity of marriage, to show its detestation of a horrible crime dangerous alike to the purity of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and the peace and security of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and to bar the criminal from gaining the result intended by his crime, the Fathers decreed: between the abductor and abducted there can be no marriage, as long as she remains in the power of the raptor; but if the abducted, having been separated from the abductor, and having been placed in a safe and free place, consents to have him for a husband, let her marry him; yet, notwithstanding, the abductor with all his advisers, accomplices and abettors, are by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and declared forever <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>, incapable of acquiring dignities, and, if they be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> from their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rank. Furthermore, the abductor is bound, whether he marries the abducted or not, to <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dower</a> her with a decent dowry at the discretion of the judge (Concil. Trid., Sess. XXIV, vi, "De Reform Matrim."). This law was to take immediate effect, requiring no <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> in individual <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Such also is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> (Synod. Mont. Liban., 1736, Collect. Lacens., II, 167; Synod. Sciarfien. Syror., 1888). The difference between this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and that of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> (<a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>) is evident. According to the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> consent, given even while she was in the raptor's power, was deemed sufficient. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> does not consider such consent of any avail, and requires consent given after the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has been entirely separated from the control of the raptor and is dwelling in a place safe and free from his influence. Should she desire to marry him, the marriage may be celebrated, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> having first obtained permission from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (according to some) whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to testify to the cessation of the impediment and that the dowry prescribed by the Council has been made over and is subject to the sole use and discretion of the abducted. The general law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not require the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> permission, but individual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> can and do make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to that effect.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> by this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> safeguarded the freedom of marriage (1) on the part of the man, by allowing him to marry the abducted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and (2) on the part of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, by protecting her from being coerced while in the abductor's power into a marriage against her <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> and consent. This impediment of abduction (<em>raptus</em>) is one entirely distinct from that of <em>vis et metus</em>. The latter entirely looks to the freedom of consent; the former, to the freedom of the place where <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> consent must be elicited. Of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> origin, this impediment is temporary and public, and does not bind two unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> unless the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> of their country invalidates such marriages. It does, however, govern the marriage of an unbaptized abductor with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> abducted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and vice versa.

<p>Amidst the conflicting opinions of canonists and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a> as to whether abduction by seduction, abduction of a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, abduction of a minor against the will of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or the abduction of a man by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, induces the impediment or not, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to remember that this impediment is of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> origin, and therefore the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> was sole judge of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>; that the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman</a> or any other <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> or any prior ecclesiastical law had nothing to say in the matter; that the question under investigation was the impediment, not the crime, of abduction; and that <em>in rebus odiosis</em>, which this is, the words of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> must be strictly adhered to and interpreted.

<p>Four elements are essential in an abduction in order to induce thereby the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> diriment impediment, to wit: (1) a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; (2) change of locality; (3) <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; (4) matrimonial <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intent</a>.

<p>(1) <em>Any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></em>, whether moral or immoral, maid or <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> or not, even a public <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, may be the object of a violent abduction inducing the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> impediment and punishment. <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02148a.htm">Avancini</a>, and others hold that a man is not guilty of abduction who carries off his <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> makes no exception, hence we should not. The abduction of a man by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is not included in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> law. The contrary opinion (De Justis and other earlier authors) is at variance with the language of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council</a>, which always speaks of the <em>raptor</em>, but nowhere of the <em>raptrix</em>. A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> can be guilty of the crime of <em>raptus</em>; but the question here is not about crime, but about the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> impediment. She may be an agent or accomplice of the abductor and, as such, incur the penalties decreed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council</a>; but it does not admit her as <em>raptrix.</em>

<p>(2) <em>Change of Locality. --</em> Two places are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to an abduction &#151; one, the place from which, the other, the place to which, the reluctant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> taken, and in which she is also <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> detained. These two places must be morally (some say physically, some virtually) different &#151; the one, <em>from which</em> may be her own or her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> home, where she is a free agent; the other, <em>to which</em>, must be subject to the power or influence of the abductor, where, though she is free in very many of her actions, she is not perfectly free in all. It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the place to which be the house of the abductor; it suffices if it be under his control or influence. Two rooms or two stories in a small dwelling, the home of one <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; a street and an adjoining house; a public highway and a nearby field, would not afford the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> change of locality. Removal, though violent, from room to room as above, would not induce the impediment under consideration, though some hold the contrary opinion. In case of a large castle, or mansion, or tenement-house, where many <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> dwell, the violent transference of a reluctant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from a part where her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> dwells to another remote part where a different <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> lives would constitute sufficient change of locality. If a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> seized, e.g. in a room, and is <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> kept there without change to another room, or if she willingly, without any enticement on the part of the man, goes to a place and is there <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> detained with matrimonial intent, she does not suffer abduction in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> sense. It is a mere sequestration, or detention. Some jurists, however, think otherwise, claiming virtual change (from state of freedom to that of subjection) to be sufficient to induce the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council's</a> impediment. Physical transference from one place to another, however, is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to constitute <em>raptus</em>; virtual transference does not suffice. Should a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> be forcibly removed from a place to which she went willingly to another where she is detained against her will with matrimonial intent, it is abduction.

<p>(3) <em>Violence.</em> &#151; Abduction always presumes that the abducted dissents, and that her unwillingness is overcome either by physical force, i.e. laying hands upon her, or moral force, i.e. threats, great fear, and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> equivalent to force. Mere importunities, fair words, sweet phrases, gifts, and promises are not sufficient to constitute the moral force requisite for abduction. It is immaterial whether the principal, of and by himself, or through his agents and accomplices, uses this force, moral or physical. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> as the agents of the principal, may exercise it, and not infrequently do so.

<p>(4) <em>Matrimonial Intent. --</em> The intention or motive of the criminal act is all important. To induce the impediment the intent must be to marry the abducted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Were the motive other than marriage, e.g. vengeance, pecuniary gain, or gratification of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, there would be no abduction, no impediment, no penalties (S. Cong. Cone., 23 Jan., 1585). This is evident also from the <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, which, in all <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> given or faculties granted to <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinaries</a> to dispense in cases of <a href="../cathen/01178a.htm">affinity</a>, <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a>, etc., prefixes "provided that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was not abducted on account of this [marriage]". This impediment exists only between the abducted and abductor who, of and by himself, or with the assistance of others, had carried her off with intent to marry her. No impediment arises between the abducted and the agent or abettors of the abduction. She could validly, therefore, marry one of the agents or accomplices while still under the control of the abductor. When the intention is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, judgment is arrived at from consideration of the circumstances. Thus, if a man <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> carries off his <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> or a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with whom he has had conversations looking to future marriage, it is presumed that his intention was marriage. If <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> still remain, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> presumes the motive to be matrimonial. Where it is abundantly evident that the initial motive of the abduction was <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, it is not abduction, but sequestration, or detention, although afterwards, during the captivity, the captor promise marriage in order to attain his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lustful</a> object. The contrary opinion, held by Rosset (De Matrimonio, II, 1354), Krimer, and others, is at variance with the principle of law, that in crimes the beginning, and not what happens accidentally is what the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> considers. Were the intent twofold, e.g. <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and marriage, then the carrying off is abduction and induces the impediment. The abduction must be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, not presumed. The mere word of the abducted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, especially as against the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of the so-called abductor and the absence of all rumour, does not establish the fact. The existence of the abduction once admitted, the burden of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> rests upon the abductor. He must conclusively prove that the abducted willingly consented to both abduction and marriage. If she admits consent to the flight, he must still prove conclusively that she gave willing consent also to the marriage; otherwise the impediment holds and the penalties are incurred. Should he claim (in order to exclude impediment) that his motive in the beginning of the transaction was not marriage, but <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and that he proposed marriage in order to attain his initial purpose, then he must, by the most conclusive evidence, establish his assertion, since the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> presumes that his motive was matrimonial.
<h2>Punishments</h2>

<p>The abductor and his advisers and abettors and accomplices in a complete (copula not required), not merely an attempted, abduction are, by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself (<a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a>), <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> (not <a href="../cathen/12785a.htm">reserved</a>), and made perpetually <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>, incapable of acquiring dignities; if they be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, they also incur <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposition</a> from their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rank. The abductor is also bound, whether the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> marries him or not, to dower her with a decent dowry at the discretion of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who celebrates the marriage while the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is under restraint does not incur the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> nor any other penalty, unless he has advised the abductor that he would aid him in his abduction by his presence and ministry. The agents and the like, in an abduction of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> validly and freely <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, but unwilling to be carried off, do not incur <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and other <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> punishments (S. C. Prop. Fid., 17 April, 1784). The vindictive punishments are incurred, at least in the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a>, by a declaratory sentence. The abducted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, not the abductor, has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to challenge the validity of her marriage celebrated while under control of the abductor. No particular time is prescribed by law, but she should, however, unless prevented by reasonable cause, present her plea as soon as possible after her entire separation from the control of the abductor.
<h2>Dispensation</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Church</a> as a rule does not <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispense</a> with this impediment. It even refuses to grant other <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, e.g. affinity, if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was abducted; indeed any <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> granted, in which mention of the abduction has been omitted, is held as invalid. There are some cases in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Church</a> has dispensed when it is abundantly evident that the consent of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was really free, although circumstances prevented her entire separation from the control of the abductor. The late Instruction of the Congregation of the Inquisition (15 February, 1901, in the "Analecta Ecclesiastica," Rome, 1901, 98) to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albania</a> (where abduction is of very frequent occurrence) refused a general repeal of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for their country, adding that the frequency mentioned, far from being a reason for relaxing, was rather a reason for insisting on the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> law; yet, where it was abundantly evident that the consent of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> under restraint was truly a free consent, and that there were reasons sufficient for the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, recourse should be had to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in each single case. Further, in the extraordinary faculties given to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (20 February, 1888) for <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensing</a> in public impediments <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in danger of death, the impediment of <em>raptus</em> is not excluded. The civil codes of today, as a rule, do not recognize abduction as an impediment diriment to <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a>, but consider it as a <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> of <em>vis et metus</em>. The codes of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, however, still hold it as an impediment, and among the jurists of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> there is an earnest endeavour to make it an impediment absolute and perpetual, so that the abducted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, if still under control of her abductor, may not marry even a third party.
