<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Abel</h1>  

<p>(From the Hebrew word for <em>Vanity</em>, "probably so called from the shortness of his life"--Gesenius; Greek <em>Abel</em>, whence English form).

<p>Abel was the second son of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Vigouroux and Hummelauer contend that the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrian</a> <em>aplu</em> or <em>ablu</em>, const. <em>Abal</em>, i.e. "son," is the same word, not a case of orthographic coincidence, especially as Hebrew and Assyrian are closely related tongues. Some, with <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Ant., I, ii), think it means "Sorrow" or "Lamentation". Cheyne holds that "a right view of the story favours the meaning shepherd, or more generally herdsman"; Assyrian <em>ibilu</em> (Ency. Bib., s.v.) "ram, camel, ass, or wild sheep."

<p>Cain, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, was a farmer. Abel owned the flocks that lived upon the soil. The two were, therefore, doubly brothers, by birth and by calling.

<p>Abel is not mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> except in <a href="../bible/gen004.htm">Genesis 4</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> makes him a <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">type</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12714a.htm">regenerate</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> of the natural, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. "<a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> founded a city on earth, but Abel as a stranger and pilgrim looked forward to the city of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../fathers/120115.htm"><em>City of God</em> XV.1</a>). The descendants of <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> were wicked, but, as nothing is said about those of Abel, it is supposed that he had none; or at least that no son was alive at the birth of Seth, "whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given me for Abel", as <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> expressed it (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs25">Genesis 4:25</a>).

<p>The Abelians, or Abelites, a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> in northern <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> mentioned by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (de Haer., lxxxvii), pretended that they imitated Abel by marrying, yet condemned the use of marriage. They adopted children who also married and lived in the same manner as their foster-parents. The <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">biblical</a> account of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the brothers and of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Abel states that <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> offered "of the fruits of the earth", Abel "of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat". <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain's</a> <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offerings</a> are not qualified, Abel's show that he gave with generosity and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and therefore found favour with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> says (Ant., I, ii), "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was more delighted with the latter (Abel's) oblation, when He was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with what grew naturally of its own accord than He was with what was the invention of a <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, and gotten by forcing the ground." St. John gives the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rejected <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain's</a> sacrifice and accepted that of Abel: "his own works were wicked; and his brother's just" (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs12">1 John 3:12</a>). <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said later, "I will not receive a gift of your hand" (<a href="../bible/mal001.htm#vrs10">Malachi 1:10</a>). The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the heart must sanctify the lifting of the hands. <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> offered <em>dans Deo aliquid suum, sibi autem seipsum</em> (de Civ. Dei, XV, vii), but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> says to all what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> wrote to the Corinthians, "I seek not the things that are yours, but you" (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs14">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>).

<p>In Hebrew, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and Arabic traditions and legends it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> showed his acceptance of Abel's sacrifice by sending fire to consume it, as in <a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#vrs38">1 Kings 18:38</a>. <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> thereupon resolved to <a href="../cathen/15108a.htm">kill</a> his brother, thinking the latter would supplant him as <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> did <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> later; or because he thought the seed of Abel would have the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of crushing the serpent's head (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs16">Genesis 3:16</a>), following <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> tradition, makes the plain of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> the scene of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and interprets the name of the city <em>sanguinem bibens</em> (blood-drinking). A traveller quoted with approval by the Rev. S. Baring-Gould (<em>Legends of the Old-Testament Characters</em>) places the scene half a mile from <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>; but there is no such local tradition in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>. The Damascus referred to is certainly the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> city. The <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a> (Sura v, 30, etc.) agrees with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in the main facts about the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, but adds the legend that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent a raven which by scratching in the earth showed <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> how to bury his brother. According to Jewish tradition, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> were taught by the raven how to bury their son, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rewarded the raven by granting three things: (1) his young were to be inviolable, (2) abundance of food, (3) his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for rain should be granted (Pirke Rab: Eliezer, XXI).

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> Abel is often mentioned. His pastoral life, his sacrifice, his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, his tragic death made him a striking type of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Divine Saviour</a>. His just works are referred to in <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs12">1 John 3:12</a>; he is canonized by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#vrs34">Matthew 23:34-35</a>) as the first of the long line of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice'</a> sake. He <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesied</a> not by word, but by his sacrifice, of which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> by <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> the <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">typical</a> meaning (Vigouroux); and also by his death (<a href="../fathers/120115.htm"><em>City of God</em> XV.18</a>). In <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#vrs24">Hebrews 12:24</a>, his death is mentioned, and the contrast between his blood and that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is shown. The latter calls not for vengeance, but for mercy and pardon. Abel, though dead, speaketh (<a href="../bible/heb011.htm#vrs4">Hebrews 11:4</a>), <em>Deo per merita, hominibus per exemplum</em> (<a href="../cathen/12075c.htm">Piconio</a>), i.e. to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by his <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>, to men by his example. For a <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">rabbinic</a> interpretation of the plural <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> meaning "bloods", in <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs10">Genesis 4:10</a>, see Mishna San., IV, 5, where it is said to refer to Abel and to his seed. The Fathers place him among the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. <em>Martyrium dedicavit</em> (St. Aug., op. cit., VI, xxvii); he is associated with <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> (Adv. Judaeos, viii, 8); others speak in similar terms. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, however, he is not found in the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> before the tenth century (Encycl. th&eacute;ol., s.v.).

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">canon of the Mass</a> his sacrifice is mentioned with those of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and his name is placed at the head of the list of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> invoked to aid the dying. The views of radical <a href="../cathen/04491c.htm">higher criticism</a> may be summed up in the words of Cheyne: "The story of <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> and Abel is an early <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelitish</a> legend retained by J as having a profitable tendency" (Encycl. bib., s.v.). The conservative interpretation of the narrative differs from that of the radical school of critics, because it accepts the story as history or as having at least a historic basis, while they regard it as only one of the legends of Genesis.
