<h1>Abenakis</h1>  

<p>A confederation of <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> tribes, comprising the <a href="../cathen/11644a.htm">Penobscots</a>, Passamaquoddies, Norridgewocks, and others, formerly occupying what is now <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, and southern New Brunswick.

<p>Their territory joined that of the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmacs</a> on the northeast, and that of the <a href="../cathen/11644a.htm">Penobscots</a> on the southwest. Their speech is a dialect of the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmac</a> language of the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">North American Indians</a>. They took sides with the French and maintained an increasing hostility against encroachments of the English. When their principal town, Norridgewock, was taken, and their missionary, <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Rasle</a>, was killed (1724), the greater part of them removed to <a href="../cathen/13348a.htm">St. Francis</a>, in the province of Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, whither other refugees from the New England tribes had preceded them. They are now represented by the Amalectites on the St. John River, New Brunswick, and Quebec (820); the Passamaquoddies, on the bay of that name, in Maine (300); the Penobscots, at Old Town, Maine (400), and the Abnakis at <a href="../cathen/13348a.htm">St. Francis</a> and Becancourt, Quebec (430).

<p>There are a dozen variations of the name Abenakis, such as Abenaquiois, Abakivis, Quabenakionek, Wabenakies, etc. They are described in the "Jesuit Relations" as not cannibals, and as docile, ingenious, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperate</a> in the use of liquor, and not profane. Their language has been preserved in the monumental dictionary of <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Sebastian Rasle</a>.

<p>After the unsuccessful attempt of de la Saussaye, in 1613, to plant a colony as Mount Desert &#151; where the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> <a href="../cathen/02541d.htm">Biard</a>, <a href="../cathen/10030b.htm">Mass&eacute;</a>, and Quentin proposed to evangelize the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> and the Recollects, aided by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> from the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec, undertook the work, but met with indifferent success. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/05164a.htm">Druillettes</a> was sent to them in 1646, but remained only a short time. Subsequently, other missionaries like Bigot, Thury, and de la Chasse laboured among them, but three years after the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Father Rasle</a>, that is to say in 1727, when Fathers Syvesme and Lauverjat withdrew, there was no resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, though the Indians were visited by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from time to time. They remained unalterably attached to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and during the Revolution, when Washington sent to ask them to join with the colonies against <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, they assented on condition that a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should be sent to them. Some of the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> of the French fleet communicated with them, promising to comply with their request, but beyond that nothing was done. At the present time there are <a href="../cathen/10378a.htm">Indian missions</a> for the remnants of the tribe at Calais, Eastport, and Old Town.
