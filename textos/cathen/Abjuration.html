<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Abjuration</h1>  

<p>A denial, disavowal, or renunciation under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. In common <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> language this term is restricted to the renunciation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> made by the penitent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> on the occasion of his reconciliation with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always demanded such renunciation, accompanied by appropriate penance. In some cases the abjuration was the only <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> required; in others abjuration was followed by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> or by unction, or both by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> and by unction. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (A.D. 590-604) in a letter (Epistolae, lib. XI, Ep. lxvii, P.L., Tom. LXXVII, Col. 1204-08; Decret. Gratiani, Pars III, Dist. iv, c. xliv) to Quiricus and the Bishops of Iberia concerning the reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, sets forth the practice of the ancient Church in this matter. According to this testimony of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, in cases where the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was invalid, as with the <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulinists</a>, <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, or Cataphrygians (Conc. Nicaen., can. xix, P.L., II, 666; Decret. Gratiani, Pars II Causa I, Q. i, c. xlii), <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomians</a> (<a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Anomoeans</a>), and others, the rule was that the penitent should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> (<em>cum ad sanctam Ecclesiam veniunt, baptizantur</em>); but where the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was considered valid <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> were admitted into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> either by anointing with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, or by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> or by a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>aut unctione chrismatis, aut impositione manus, aut professione fidei ad sinum matris Ecclesiae revocantur</em>).

<p>Applying this rule, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> declares that <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> were received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the West by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, in the East by unction (<em>Arianos per impositionem manus Occidens, per unctionem vero sancti chrismatis . . . Oriens, reformat</em>), while the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, who separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the fifth and sixth centuries, were treated with less severity, being admitted, with some others, upon a mere profession of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> [<em>sola vera confessione recipit (Ecclesia)</em>]. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> statement applies to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (Siricius, Epist., i, c. i; Epist., iv, c. viii; Innoc. I, Epist. ii, c. viii; Epist. xxii, c. iv), but not to the whole <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, since in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the rite of unction was also in use [Second Coun. of Arles, can. xvii; Coun. of Orange (A.D. 529), can. ii; Coun. of Epaon, can. xxi; Greg. of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, Historia, lib. II, c. xxxi; lib. IV, cc. xxvii, xxviii; lib. V, c. xxxix; lib. IX, c. xv].

<p>As to the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> phrase entirely agrees with the rule laid down in the seventh canon of Constantinople, which, though not emanating from the Ecumenical Council of 381 bears Witness nevertheless to the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople in the fifth century [Duchesne, Christian Worship (London, 1904), 339, 340]. This canon, which was inserted in the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan or Quinisext Synod</a> (canon xcv), and thus found a place in Byzantine canon law, distinguishes between <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> whose <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but not confirmation, was accepted and those whose <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and confirmation were rejected. With the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, consequently, are classed the Macedonians, <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a> (Conc. Nicaen., I, can. ix; Nicaen., II, can. ii), Sabellians, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarists</a>, and others, who were to be received by the anointing with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, and ears. Some identify this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> with the rite of confirmation, and not merely an <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> unto penance. A similar discussion prevails in regard to the anointing with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Imposition of hands</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, as a sign that due penance had been done, and in token of reconciliation (Pope Vigilius, P.L., CXXX, 1076), was prescribed first for those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and who had later fallen into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> in a letter to Quintus (epist. lxxi, in P.L., IV, 408-411) is witness of this practice, as is also <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (De baptismo contra Donatistas, lib. III, c. xi, in P.L., XLIII, 208). This rite was prescribed, secondly, for those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Regarding <a href="../cathen/05615b.htm">Pope Eusebius</a> (A.D. 309 or 310) we read in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a> (edit. Duchesne, I, 167): Hic hereticos invenit in Urbe Roma, quos ad manum impositionis [sic] reconciliavit. The same work (I, 216) declares of <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> (A.D. 384-399): Hic constituit hereticum sub manum impositionis reconciliari, presente cuncta ecclesia. [This latter was doubtless copied from the first chapter of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> of <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a>, writing to Himerius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (P.L., XIII, 1133, 1134; Duchesne, Liber Pontif;, I, 132, 133).] Pope St. Stephen declares this rite to be sufficient (see St. Cyprian, Epist. lxxiv, in P.L., IV, 412, 413; Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.3</a>). The first <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (A.D. 314), can. viii [Labbe, Concilia (Paris, 1671), I, 1428; P.L., CXXX, 376] inculcates the same law. (See also <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a>, Epist. clix, c. vii; Epist. clxvi, c. ii; Epist. clxvii, Inquis. 18; P.L., LIV.)
<h2 id="section2">Unction</h2>

<p>The unction alone or together with the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> was also in vogue. The Council of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> (A.D. 373) in canon vii (Labbe, Concilia, I, 1497) confirms this usage in the abjuration of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a>, <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a>, and Quartodecimans. The second <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (A.D. 451) in canon xvii (Labbe, IV, 1013) extends the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> to adherents of <a href="../cathen/02677b.htm">Bonosius</a>, adversaries of the virginity of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> (<em>Bonosianos . . . cum chrismate, et manus impositione in Ecclesia recipi sufficit</em>). The Council of Epaon (A.D. 517), canon xvi (Labbe, IV, 1578), allows the same rite (<em>Presbyteros, . . . si conversionem subitam petant, chrismate subvenire permittimus</em>).
<h2 id="section3">Profession of faith</h2>

<p>Especially after the birth of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutychianism</a>, to abjuration of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was added a solemn profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It was thus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who, in the Second Council of Ephesus, had espoused the cause of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> and <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a> were reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> (Epist. xlviii, ad Donat. Epis. Nicopol., P.G., LXXII, 252) received a like profession from Paul of <a href="../cathen/05402a.htm">Emesa</a>, who was thought to be affected with <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> (Epist. i, Ad Episc. Aquilens. c. ii, in P.L., LIV, 594) required the same from the votaries of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, as did also a council, held at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> in 799, from Felix, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a> [<a href="../cathen/01375a.htm">Alzog</a>, Universal Church Hist. (tr. Cincinnati, 1899), II, 181].

<p>It is to be noted that as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, unless degraded or reduced to the lay state, were not submitted to the humiliation of public penance, so, consequently, their admission into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> involved no <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> or other <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> except a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Fratres Ballerini</a>, in Epist. S. Leon., n. 1594, P.L., LIV, 1492). In all cases there was demanded the presentation of a <em>libellus</em>, or form of abjuration, in which the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> renounced and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> his former tenets. After declaring his abjuration to be free from compulsion, fear, or other unworthy motive, he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> in general and in particular that <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> to which he had belonged, together with its heresiarchs, past, present, and future. He then enumerated the tenets accepted by said <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and, having repudiated them singly and generally, he ended with a profession of his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith. Sometimes there was added, under pain of punishment, a promise to remain in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Accidental differences only are found in the ancient formulas of abjuration extant. Later, in the countries especially where the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> was established, three sorts of abjuration were practised: <ul> <li>Abjuration <em>de formali</em> (of formal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>), made by a <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> or <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>; <li><em>de vehementi</em> (of strong suspicion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>), made by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> strongly suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; <li><em> de levi</em> (of slight suspicion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>), made by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> slightly suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. </ul> The abjuration demanded of <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> in the present <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> is essentially the same as the above. A <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who has never been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to abjure <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. A <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is considered valid, or who, at most, on his reception into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is rebaptized conditionally, is required to make a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which contains an abjuration of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. A salutary penance also is imposed (S. Cong. S. Off., Nov., 1875. See Appendix Conc. Plen. Balt., II, 277, 278; American edit. <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, 1, 2, 3). No abjuration is required from <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> under the age of fourteen (S. Cong. S. Off., Mar. 8, 1882, in Collectanea S. Cong. de Propag. Fid., n. 1680, ed. 1903).
