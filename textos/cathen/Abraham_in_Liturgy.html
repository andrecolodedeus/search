<h1>Abraham (in Liturgy)</h1>  

<p>While of peculiar interest to the liturgiologist (especially in the classification of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> of the East and of the West, as is noted below under <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">MISSAL</a>), the inclusion of noted names of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Churches</a> must be a subject of sufficiently general interest to warrant some brief notice here. Of all the names thus used, a special prominence accrues to those of Abel, <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> through their association with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sacrifice and their employment in this connection in the most solemn part of the Canon of the Mass in the Roman rite. The inclusion in the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">Litany</a> for the Dying (Roman Ritual) of only two (Abel and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>) out of all the great names of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> must give these a special prominence in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but of these two, again, the name of Abraham occurs so often and in such a variety of connections, as to make his position in the liturgy one of very decided pre-eminence. Of first interest will be the present use of the word <em>Abraham</em> in the Roman liturgy:
<h2>Martyrology (9th October)</h2>

<p>"Eodem die memoria S. Abrahae Patriarchae et omnium credentium Patris" (The same day, the memory of S. Abraham Patriarch and Father of all believers).
<h2>Ritual</h2>

<p>(a) In the <em>Ordo commendationis animae</em> (Recommendation of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> departing), the brief <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> includes but two names from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, that of the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Baptist</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>: <blockquote> Holy Mary, <em><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him.</em> All ye <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a> and Archangels, <em><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him.</em> Holy Abel, <em><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him.</em> All ye choirs of the just, <em><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him.</em> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Holy Abraham</a>, <em><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him.</em> <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John Baptist</a>, <em><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him.</em> St. Joseph, <em><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him.</em> </blockquote>

<p>In the <em>Libera</em> (Deliver, etc.), which follows shortly after, many names of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are mentioned, including <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, but omitting Abel: "Deliver . . . as thou didst deliver <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> from Ur of the Chaldeans".

<p>(b) <em>Benedictio peregrinorum</em> (Blessing of pilgrims etc.). The second <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> reads: "O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who didst guide Abraham safely through all the ways of his journey from Ur of the Chaldeans....
<h2>Breviary</h2>

<p>(a) On <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima Sunday</a> the lessons from <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> begin with the <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#vrs1">first verse of Genesis</a>, and the formal narrative of Abraham begins with <a href="../cathen/12614a.htm">Quinquagesima Sunday</a>, the lessons ending on Shrove Tuesday with the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>.

<p>(b) The antiphon to the <em>Magnificat</em> on <a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Passion Sunday</a> is: "Abraham your father rejoiced . . ." (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#vrs56">John 8:56</a>). Again, the first antiphon of the second nocturn of the Common of Apostles reads: "The princes of the people are gathered together with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>". The occurrence of the name in the last verse of the <em>Magnificat</em> itself: "As he spake to our fathers, to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and his seed forever" and in the <em>Benedictus</em> (sixth verse): "The <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> our father . . ." make the name of daily occurrence in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, as these two Canticles are sung daily the former at <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, the latter at <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psaltery</a>, also, recited during every week, the name occurs in <a href="../bible/psa046.htm#vrs10">Psalms 46:10</a>, <a href="../bible/psa104.htm#vrs9">104:9</a>, <a href="../bible/psa104.htm#vrs42">104:42</a>. See also the third strophe of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> <em>Quicumque Christum quaeritis</em> (<a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of Transfiguration D. N. J. C. and various Lessons in the <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturns</a>, e.g. <em>Feria 3a infra Hebd. vi p. Pent., Feria 3a infra oct. Corp. Christi, 2d nocturn</em>).
<h2>Missal</h2>

<p>(a) The third of the twelve lessons called "Prophecies" read on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> between the lighting of the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">Paschal Candle</a> and the Blessing of the Font deals wholly with the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> imposed upon <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. The lesson (<a href="../bible/gen022.htm#vrs1">Genesis 22:1-19</a>) is, like the others, not only read quietly by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the altar, but also chanted in a loud voice simultaneously by a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>. The dramatic incidents thus rehearsed must have impressed the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> deeply, as is evidenced by the reproduction of the incidents on the walls of <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> and on sarcophagi. The lesson is followed by a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: "O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the supreme Father of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, who throughout the world didst multiply the children of thy promise . . . and by the paschal mystery dost make <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> thy servant the father of all nations...."

<p>(b) Again, in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> after the fourth lesson: "O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, grant that the fulness of the whole world may pass over to the children of Abraham...."

<p>(c) The Epistle of the thirteenth <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after Pentecost: "To Abraham were the promises made.... But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave it to Abraham by promise...." (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs16">Galatians 3:16-22</a>).

<p>(d) <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12776d.htm">Mass for the Dead</a>: "O Lord . . . may the holy standard-bearer Michael introduce them to the holy light which Thou didst promise of old to Abraham...."

<p>(e) In the <a href="../cathen/10005a.htm">Nuptial Mass</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> reads: "May the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, be with you . . ."

<p>(f) Of greater interest than anything thus far cited is the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the Canon of the Mass, when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> extends his hands over the Consecrated Species: "Upon which do Thou vouchsafe to look . . . and accept them, as Thou didst vouchsafe to accept the gift of Thy just servant Abel, and the sacrifice of our Patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>...." Here the Canon insists on the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sacrifice, a fact common to Western <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, while those of the East, except the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a>, omit in their <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">epicleses</a> all reference to the <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">typic</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and appear concerned with impressing the faithful with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> rather of sacrament and communion. This is esteemed a fact of capital importance towards a classification of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>.

<p>(g) In the Sequence of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> while <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is not named, his sacrifice (unbloody, like that of the altar) is commemorated in the lines <em>In figuris praesignatur, Cum Isaac immolatur....</em>
<h2>Pontifical</h2>

<p>In one of the Prefaces of the Consecration of an altar we read: "May it have as much grace with Thee as that which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the father of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, built when about to sacrifice his son as a figure of our <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> . . ." Again, in the Blessing of a Cemetery (third <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>) and in connection with <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a> and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> (sixth <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>). Finally, in two of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> for the Blessing and Coronation of a King. The exalted position of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in Sacred History, and the frequent use of his name in invocations etc. in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (e.g. <a href="../bible/gen028.htm#vrs13">Genesis 28:13</a>; <a href="../bible/gen032.htm#vrs9">32:9</a>; <a href="../bible/gen048.htm#vrs15">48:15-16</a>; <a href="../bible/exo003.htm#vrs6">Exodus 3:6, 15, 16</a>; <a href="../bible/exo004.htm#vrs5">4:5</a>; <a href="../bible/tob007.htm#vrs15">Tobit 7:15</a> etc.), and the continued use thereof by the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs13">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="../bible/act007.htm#vrs32">7:32</a>) made his name of frequent occurrence in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a> and even amongst <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagans</a>, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the significance of the formula "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>" etc., in magical rites and incantations, as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> testifies.
