<h1>Absolution</h1>  

<p>(<em>Ab</em> = from; <em>solvere</em> = to free)

<p>Absolution is the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or of the punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, granted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. (For remission of punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, see CENSURE, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">EXCOMMUNICATION</a>, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">INDULGENCE</a>.)

<p>Absolution proper is that act of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whereby, in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, he frees man from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It presupposes on the part of the penitent, contrition, confession, and promise at least of satisfaction; on the part of the minister, valid reception of the Order of Priesthood and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, granted by competent authority, over the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> receiving the sacrament. That there is in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> power to absolve <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> thus declares: "But the Lord then principally instituted the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, when, being raised from the dead, He breathed upon His disciples saying, 'Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall retain, they are retained.' By which action so signal, and words so clear the consent of all the Fathers has ever understood that the power of forgiving and retaining <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was communicated to the Apostles, and to their lawful successors for the reconciling of the faithful who have fallen after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>" (Sess. XIV, i). Nor is there lacking in divine revelation <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of such power; the classical texts are those found in <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs19">Matthew 16:19</a>; <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs18">18:18</a>, and in <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs21">John 20:21-23</a>. To Peter are given the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Sin is the great obstacle to entrance into the kingdom, and over <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> Peter is supreme. To Peter and to all the Apostles is given the power to bind and to loose, and this again implies supreme power both legislative and judicial: power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, power to free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin's</a> penalties. This interpretation becomes more clear in studying the rabbinical literature, especially of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> time, in which the phrase to bind and to loose was in common use. (Lightfoot, Hor&aelig; Hebraic&aelig; Buxtorf, Lexicon Chald.; Knabenbauer, Commentary on Matthew, II, 66; particularly Maas, St. Matthew, 183, 184.) The granting of the power to absolve is put with unmistakable clearness in <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John's Gospel</a>: "He breathed upon them and said, 'Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye shall forgive they are forgiven them; and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye shall retain, they are retained'" (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs22">20:22-23</a>). It were foolish to assert that the power here granted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was simply a power to announce the Gospel (Council of Trent, Sess. XIX, Can. iii), and quite as unwise to contend that here is contained no power other than the power to remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a> (Ibid., Sess. XIV); for the very context is against such an interpretation, and the words of the text imply a strictly judicial act, while the power to retain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> becomes simply incomprehensible when applied to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> alone, and not to an action involving discretionary judgment. But it is one thing to assert that the power of absolution was granted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and another to say that a full realization of the grant was in the consciousness of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the beginning. Baptism was the first, the great sacrament, the sacrament of initiation into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Christ</a>. Through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was obtained not only plenary pardon for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also for temporal punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Man once born anew, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideal forbade even the thought of his return to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Of a consequence, early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> was loath to grant even once a restoration to grace through the ministry of reconciliation vested in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This severity was in keeping with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> declaration in his Epistle to the Hebrews: "For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have tasted also the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, have moreover tasted the good word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the powers of the world to come and are fallen away, to be renewed again to penance" etc. (vi, 4-6). The persistence of this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideal is very clear in the "Pastor" of Hermas, where the author contends against a rigorist <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, that at least <em>one</em> opportunity for penance must be given by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (III Sim., viii, 11). He grants only one such chance, but this is sufficient to establish a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. St. Ignatius in the first days of the second century seemingly asserts the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> when he declares in his letter to the Philadelphians that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presides over penance. This tradition was continued in the Syrian Church, as is evident from passages found in <a href="../cathen/01593c.htm">Aphraates</a> and <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">Ephrem</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> voices this same Syrian tradition when he writes "De Sacerdotio" (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> P.G., LXVII, 643), that "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has given to his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> a power he would not grant to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, for he has not said to them, 'Whatsoever ye bind, will be bound,'" etc.; and further down he adds, "The Father hath given all judgment into the hands of his Son, and the Son in turn has granted this power to his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>."



<p><a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, who perhaps received his inspiration from the "Pastor" of Hermas, tells the story of the young bandit whom St. John went after and brought back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the story he speaks of the "Angel of Penance", meaning the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who presided over the public penance. Following Clement in the Catechetical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> was <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (230). In the commentary on the words of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, "Forgive us our trespasses", he alludes to the practice of penance in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, recalling the text of <a href="../bible/joh020.htm">John 20:21</a>. He asserts that this text is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the power to pardon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> conferred by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> upon His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and upon their successors. True it is that in writing of the extent of the power conferred, he makes exception for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, which he terms irremissible, although <a href="../cathen/05010a.htm">Dionysius of Corinth</a> (170) years before held that no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was excepted from the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> granted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.23</a>). In the Alexandrian Church we have also the testimony of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, who in a fragment against the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a> pointedly asserts: "He who confesses his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, receives from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> pardon for his fault, in virtue of the grace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (just as he who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>)." <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> is at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> witness of this power to absolve. <a href="../cathen/06080b.htm">St. Firmilian</a>, in his famous letter to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, asserts that the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was given to the Apostles and to their successors (<em><a href="../fathers/050675.htm">Epistle 75 of Cyprian</a></em>), and this tradition is more clearly expressed both in Basil and <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a> (P.G., XXXI, 1284; XXXVI, 356, 357). The Roman tradition is clear in the "Pastor" of Hermas, where the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is defended (Sim., viii, 6, 5; ibid., ix, 19). This same tradition is manifest in the Canons of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, wherein the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> consecrating a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is directed to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: "Grant him, O Lord, the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (xxii). This is still more clearly expressed in the "Constitutiones Apostolic&aelig;" (P.G., I, 1073): "Grant him, O Lord Almighty, by Thy <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> the fulness of Thy spirit, that he may have the power to pardon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in accordance with Thy command, that he may loose every bond which binds the sinner, by reason of that power which Thou hast granted Thy Apostles." (See also Duchesne, "Christian Worship", 439, 440.) True, this power seems to Hermas to be strangely limited, while <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, and the followers of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> principles were unwilling to grant that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to absolve from such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as apostasy, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. However, <a href="../cathen/03183d.htm">Calixtus</a> settled the question for all time when he declared that in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, he would grant pardon to all who did penance &mdash; <em>Ego . . . delicta p&oelig;nitenti&acirc; functis dimitto</em>, or again, <em>Habet potestatem ecclesia delicta donandi</em> (<a href="../fathers/0407.htm"><em>On Pudicity</em> 21</a>). In this matter, see <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../fathers/0407.htm">"De Pudiciti&acirc;"</a>, which is simply a vehement protest against the action of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> accuses of presumption in daring to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and especially the greater crimes of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, etc. &mdash; "Idcirco pr&aelig;sumis et ad te derivasse solvendi et alligandi potestatem, id est, ad omnem Ecclesiam Petri propinquam." <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> himself, before becoming a <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a>, asserts in the clearest terms that the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. "Collocavit Deus in vestibulo p&oelig;nitentiam januam secundam, qu&aelig; pulsantibus patefaciat [januam]; sed jam semel, quia jam secundo, sed amplius nunquam, quia proxime frustra" (De P&oelig;nitenti&acirc;, vii, 9, 10). Although <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> limits the exercise of this power, he stoutly asserts its existence, and clearly states that the pardon thus obtained reconciles the sinner not only with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Harnack, Dogmengeschichte, I, note 3, 407). The whole <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a> controversy is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the position taken by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and the great Doctors of the West affirmed in the strongest terms the power to absolve granted to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. (<a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a>, P.L., LIV, 1011-1013; <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>, P.L., LXVI, 1200; <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, P.L., XV, 1639; XVI, 468, 477, etc.; Augustine, P.L., XXXIX, 1549-59.)

<p>From the days, therefore, of <a href="../cathen/03183d.htm">Calixtus</a> the power to absolve <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is recognized as vested in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in virtue of the command of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to bind and loose, and of the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>. At first this power is timidly asserted against the rigorist party; afterwards stoutly maintained. At first the sinner is given one opportunity for pardon, and gradually this <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is extended; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, some <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> thought certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> unpardonable, save by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, but this was because they considered that the existing <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> marked the limits of the power granted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. After the middle of the fourth century, the universal practice of public penance precludes any denial of a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> power to pardon the sinner, though the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and the practice of penance were destined to have a still further expansion.
<h2>Later patristic age</h2>

<p>Following the golden age of the Fathers, the assertion of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to absolve and the extension of the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> are even more marked. The ancient <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">sacramentaries</a> &mdash; Leonine, Gelasian, Gregorian, the "Missale Francorum" &mdash; witness this especially in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> service; then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that "whatever they bind, shall be bound" etc. (Duchesne, Christian Worship, 360, 361). The missionaries sent from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the seventh century did not establish a public form of penance, but the affirmation of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> power is clear from the "P&oelig;nitentiale Theodori", and from the legislation on the Continent, which was enacted by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who came from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, can. xxxi, Harduin). The <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">false decretals</a> (about 850) accentuated the right of absolution; and in a sermon of the same century, attributed perhaps wrongly to <a href="../cathen/05386a.htm">St. Eligius</a>, a fully developed <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is found. The Saint is speaking of the reconciliation of penitents and warns them to be sure of their dispositions, their sorrow, their purpose of amendment; for "we are powerless," he says, "to grant pardon, unless you put off the old man; but if by sincere repentance you put off the old man with his works, then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yea and by us, to whom He gave the ministry of reconciliation." And this ministry of reconciliation which he claims for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is that ministry and that power granted to the Apostles by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when He said, "Whatsoever you bind upon earth, shall be bound in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (P.L., LXXXVII, 609, 610). The <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a>, from <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> to <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, insist that the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to absolve from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was given to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who succeeded to the apostolic office (<a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, P.L., CI, 652-656; Benedict Levita, P.L., C, 357; <a href="../cathen/08499a.htm">Jonas of Orl&eacute;ans</a>, P.L., CVI, 152; Pseudo-Egbert, P.L., LXXXIX, 415; Haymo of Halberstadt, P.L., CXVIII, 762 sqq.). Following the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, the canonists, such as <a href="../cathen/12719c.htm">Regino of Pr&uuml;m</a>, <a href="../cathen/03064a.htm">Burchard of Worms</a>, <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Ivo of Chartres</a>, furnish us with fuller <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the same power, and Harduin (Councils, VI, i, 544) cites the fifteenth canon of the Council of Trosl&eacute; (909), which states expressly that penance through the ministry of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Christ's priests</a> is "fruitful unto the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>". This epoch closes with St. Bernard, who takes <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Peter Abelard</a> to task for daring to assert that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> only to His disciples, and consequently that the successors of the Apostles do not enjoy the same privileges (P.L., CLXXXII, 1054). But while Bernard insists that the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> given to the Apostles is lodged in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, he with equal stress insists that such power be not exercised unless the penitent make a full confession of wrong committed (ibid., 938). When the great scholastic epoch began, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which obtained was a power to absolve <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and this power distinctly recognized, in virtue of the power granted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. On the part of the penitent, sorrow and a promise of better life were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and also a declaration of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> made to him whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had appointed judge.
<h2>Scholastic age</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the scholastic age, special stress is laid upon the power of contrition to secure pardon. <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a>, in a commentary upon <a href="../bible/luk017.htm">Luke 17:14</a>, likens this power to that possessed of old by the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the case of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> (P.L., CLVIII, 662; ibid., 361-430). At first sight, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> seemed to annul the power to absolve which antiquity had granted to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and to reduce the office of reconciliation to a mere declaration that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had been forgiven. <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugo of St. Victor</a> (1097-1141) took ground against Anselm, not because Anselm insisted on contrition, but because he seemingly left no place for the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>. But how admit the one and not the other? Hugo says the sinner is "bound down by obduracy of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and by the penalty of future damnation"; the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> frees man from the darkness brought on by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while the absolution of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> delivers him from the penalty which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> imposes &mdash; "The malice of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is best described as obduracy of heart, which is first broken by sorrow, that later, in confession, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself, i.e. the penalty of damnation, be remitted." There is some obscurity in the text, but Hugo seems inclined to hold that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> absolves from the punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, rather than from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself. The Master of the Sentences, <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, took issue with Hugo, and asserted in clear terms that charity not only blotted out the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also freed the sinner from punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Not understanding, however, that penance as a sacrament is a moral unit, <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> in turn used language which is far from exact. He seems to hold that contrition takes away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its consequences, and when questioned concerning the power granted to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he seems to recur to the opinion of Anselm that it is declarative. "They remit or retain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> when they judge and declare them remitted or retained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (P.L., CXCII, 888). He also grants to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> certain power in reference to the temporal punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (ibid.). <a href="../cathen/13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a>, though he speaks of the opinion of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> as frivolous, in reality differs but little from the Master of the Sentences. Peter's opinion indeed exercised great influence over the minds both of his contemporaries and of the following generation. With <a href="../cathen/15631c.htm">William of Auvergne</a> (who taught up to 1228, when he became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>) comes the distinction between contrition and attrition in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. Contrition takes away all stain of guilt, while attrition prepares the way for the real remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the sacrament. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> had recognized the distinction between contrition and attrition even before <a href="../cathen/15636b.htm">William of Paris</a>, but neither <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> nor Albert, the master of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Aquinas</a>, advanced much beyond the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>. Both seemingly insisted on real contrition before absolution, and both also held that such contrition in reality took away mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. They did not, however, deny the office of the minister, for they both held that contrition involved a promise of confession [Alb. Mag., IV Sent., Dist. xvi-xvii (Paris, 1894), XXIX, 559, 660, 666, 670, 700]. <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> (IV, Dist. xvii) also admits the distinction between contrition and attrition; he asserts the power of contrition to take away all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even without the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> absolution, confession being <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> only when possible. As regards the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> power to pardon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he not only admits it, not only asserts that absolution forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its eternal consequences, but calls it the <em>forma sacramenti</em>. He even goes so far as to say that attrition is sufficient for pardon if accompanied by absolution (ibid., Dist. xviii). When questioned as to the manner in which absolution produces its sacramental effect, he distinguishes between two forms of absolution employed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: the one deprecatory, "Misereatur tui" etc., and the other indicative, "Ego te absolvo". In the former the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> intercedes for the sinner, and this intercession changes his attrition into real contrition and secures pardon for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed. In the latter, which is indicative and personal, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> exercises the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, but remits only a temporal punishment due still on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This after all is but a new way of putting the theory of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> (ibid., Dist. xviii). <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> treats this subject in his Commentary on the Master of the Sentences (IV, Dist. xvii, xviii, xix; Summa Theologica III, QQ. lxxxiv-xc; Supplement, QQ. i-xx; Opuscula, Do Form&acirc; Absolutionis). Taking the many distracted theories of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">schoolmen</a> with this partial <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he fused them into a united whole. In the commentary on the "Libri Sententiarum" he shows clearly that the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is directly instrumental in the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for "if the keys had not been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only for release from the penalty (which was the opinion of the elder scholastics), there would be no need of the intention to obtain the effect of the keys for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"; and in the same place he clearly states: "Hence if before absolution one had not been perfectly disposed to receive grace, one would receive it in sacramental confession and absolution, if no obstacle be put in the way" (Dist. xvii, 2, I, art. 3, Qu&aelig;stiuncula iv). He sees clearly that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can pardon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> uses the instrumentality of absolution which, with confession, contrition, and satisfaction, concurs in obtaining forgiveness, in blotting out the stain, in opening the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, by cancelling the sentence of eternal punishment. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is expressed again with equal clearness in the "Summa" and in the "Supplement". In the "Summa", Q. lxxxiv, art. 3, he states that the absolution of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the <em>forma sacramenti</em>, and consequently confession, contrition, and satisfaction must constitute "in some way, the matter of the sacrament". When asked whether perfect contrition secured pardon for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> even outside the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> answers in the affirmative; but then contrition is no longer an integral part of the sacrament; it secures pardon because forgiveness comes from perfect charity, independently of the instrumentality of the sacramental rite (Supplement, Q. v, a. 1). <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> not only grants the power of a solution in the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but goes a step farther and asserts that the sacrament consists principally in the absolution of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, because confession, contrition, and satisfaction are not integral parts or units in the sacrament, but only <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> previous dispositions to the reception of divine grace and forgiveness. "There is no similarity, therefore, between the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Law in regard to <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Gospel in regard to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>", and he adds that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the New Law, "exercet actum qui est signum prognosticum, efficax mundationis sequentis" etc. (edit. Viv&egrave;s, XVIII, 649, 650, in Dist. XIX; ibid., 420, 421). Some think this opinion of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> more in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, which calls contrition, confession, and satisfaction not "the matter", but <em>quasi materia</em>, "as if the matter", of the sacrament; others <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the Council thus meant to class contrition, confession, and satisfaction as mere <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> dispositions. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as taught by St. Thomas and <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> finds its echo in the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, as it does in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, which defines (Sess. XIV, chap. iii), "That the form of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, wherein its force principally consists, is placed in those words of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: 'I absolve thee' etc., but the acts of the penitent himself are <em>quasi materia</em> of this Sacrament."
<h2>Minister</h2>

<p>In the closing years of the first century, <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius of Antioch</a> asserts that Penance is in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; soon the same power is recognized in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> on extraordinary occasions performed the office of reconciliation (Batiffol, Th&eacute;ol. pos., 145 sqq.). The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> power is recognized later on in <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, in a council held at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, 1194, and in the Council of London, 1200 (cap. iii).
<h2>Time</h2>

<p>The ceremonial rite connected with the sacrament of reconciliation has also varied with the changing <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>. The earliest tradition hints at a public penance &mdash; <em>vide</em> tradition <em>supra</em> &mdash; but very soon there appears the <em>Presbyter P&oelig;nitentiarius;</em> certainly as early as 309 Pope Marcellus divided <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> into twenty-five districts <em>propter baptismum et p&oelig;nitentiam</em>, and <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> (416) mentions the "<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whose office it was to judge anent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to receive the confession of the penitent, to watch over his satisfaction, and to present him for reconciliation at the proper time". The case of Nectarius who abolished the <em>Presbyter P&oelig;nitentiarius</em> is classical (381-98). This reconciliation generally took place on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presided. Surely absolution was pronounced on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>. This all the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">sacramentaries</a> attest (Duchesne, Christian Worship, 439, 440); but the practice of public penance has given rise to the important and difficult question, whether or not the absolution granted at the public function of <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> was really the sacramental absolution. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> have questioned this, many preferring to believe that the sacramental absolution was really imparted by the <em>Presbyter P&oelig;nitentiarius</em> at the early stage of public penance, even before the satisfaction was complete. They allege as their reasons the long delay which otherwise would have been <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and the fact that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> absolved on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>, while the confession had been heard previously by the <em>Presbyter P&oelig;nitentiarius</em> (Palmieri, De p&oelig;nit., App. II, nn. 8, 9). But there are many others who think the traditional <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> cannot be safeguarded unless it is admitted that, ordinarily speaking, sacramental absolution was given only after the completion of the penance imposed and in the public session of <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>. What was done, they ask, before the institution of the <em>Presbyter P&oelig;nitentiarius</em>, or where there was no such functionary? And they answer the objections brought forward above by saying that there is no evidence in early history that a first absolution was imparted by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who determined the necessity of undergoing public satisfaction, nor are we permitted <em>a priori</em> to judge of ancient ways in the light of our modern practice (Boudinhon, Revue d'histoire de litt&eacute;rature relig., II, sec. iii, 329, 330, etc.; Batiffol, Th&eacute;olog. posit., Les origines de la p&eacute;nitence, IV, 145 sqq.). Moreover, there is full evidence of a reconciliation on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>; there are canons as late as the sixth century forbidding <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to reconcile penitents, <em>inconsulto episcopo</em> (Batiffol, ibid. 192, 193), and even as late as the ninth century there is clear testimony that absolution was not given until after the imposed penance had been completed (Benedict Levita, P.L., XCVII, 715; <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, P.L., CVII, 342; Harduin, Councils, V, 342); and when absolution was granted before <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> it was after the fashion of an exception (Pseudo <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, CI, 1192): "Denique admonendi sunt ut ad c&oelig;nam Domini redeant ad reconciliationem: si vero interest causa itineris . . . reconciliet eum statim" etc. This exception gradually became the rule, especially after the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Age</a> period began to distinguish clearly the different parts which make up the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>.
<h2>Form</h2>

<p>It is the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> that the form of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, wherein its force principally consists, is placed in these words of the minister, "I absolve thee"; to which words certain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are, according to the custom of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Church</a>, laudably added etc. (Sess. XIV, iii). That the public penance was concluded with some sort of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for pardon, is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of antiquity, particularly as contained in the earliest <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">sacramentaries</a> (Duchesne, Christian Worship, 440, 441). <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a> (450) does not hesitate to assert that pardon is impossible without the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ("ut indulgentia nisi supplicationibus sacerdotum nequeat obtineri"). In the early Church these forms certainly varied (Duchesne, loc. cit.). Surely all the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">sacramentaries</a> assert that the form was deprecatory, and it is only in the eleventh century that we find a tendency to pass to indicative and personal formul&aelig; (Duchesne, loc. cit.). Some of the forms used at the transition period are interesting: "May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> absolve thee from all thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and through the penance imposed mayst thou be absolved by the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a>, by the Saints, and by me, a wretched sinner" (Garofali, Ordo ad dandam p&oelig;nitentiam, 15). Then come really indicative and personal formul&aelig;, often preceded by the supplicatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, "Misereatur tui" etc. These forms, while much the same in substance, vary in wording not a little (Vacant, Dict. de th&eacute;ol. 167). It was not until the scholastic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of "<a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form" in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> reached its full development that the formula of absolution became fixed as we have it at present. The form in use in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> today has not changed since long before the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>. It is divided into four parts as follows: &mdash; <ul><li>(1) Deprecatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. "May the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> have mercy on you, and forgiving your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, bring you to life everlasting. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." Then, lifting his right hand towards the penitent, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> continues: "May the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty and Merciful God</a> grant you pardon, absolution, and remission of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>". <li>(2) "May <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> absolve you, and I, by His authority, absolve you from every bond of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> [<a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a>, in the case of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> only] and <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> as far as I can and you may need." <li>(3) "I absolve you from your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the name of the Father, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." (While repeating the names of the Trinity, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> makes the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> over the penitent.) <li>(4) "May the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the merits of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> and of all the Saints, what good you have done or what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> you have suffered be to you for the remission of (your) <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, growth in grace and the reward of everlasting life. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." In the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Pro Armenis", 1439, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> teaches that the "form" of the Sacrament is really in those words of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: "Ego absolvo te a peccatis tuis in nomine Patris" etc., and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> teach that absolution would be valid should the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> use, "Absolvo te", "Absolvo te a peccatis tuis", or words that are the exact equivalent (Suarez, Disp., XIX, i, n. 24; Lugo, Disp., XIII, i, nn. 17, 18; Lehmkuhl, de P&oelig;nit., 9th ed., 199). </ul>

<p>In the Oriental churches the present forms are deprecatory, though they by no means exclude the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a judicial pronouncement on the part of the minister. Such are the forms of absolution among <ul><li>Greeks, <li>Russians, <li>Syrians, <li><a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, <li><a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>.</ul>

<p>Is the indicative form <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>? Many learned <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> seem to hold that the indicative form as used at present in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> even for the validity of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. The great <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor</a> of the Sacrament, <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a> (De Sac. P&oelig;nit., n. 430), declares that no matter what may be the verdict from the point of view of history, it is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> since the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> that the indicative form is essential. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and Francisco Su&aacute;rez also declare that the indicative form is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Others equally learned, and perhaps better versed in history, hold that in the light of the Divine institution the deprecative form must not be excluded, and that the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in its <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> did not intend to make final pronouncement in the premises. They point out with Morinus (De P&oelig;nit., Lib. VIII) that up to the twelfth century the deprecatory form was employed both in the East and in the West: that it is still in use among the Greeks and among Orientals generally. In the light, therefore, of history and of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinion it is perfectly safe to conclude that the deprecatory form is certainly not invalid, if it exclude not the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of judicial pronouncement (Palmieri, Parergon, 127; <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, de P&oelig;nit.; Duchesne, loc. cit.; Soto, Vasquez, <a href="../cathen/05547a.htm">Estius</a>, <em>et al</em>.). <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a>, however, have questioned whether or not the deprecatory form would be valid today in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, and they point out that <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> have prescribed that Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should use the indicative form whensoever they absolve penitents belonging to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. But this is merely a matter of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, and such decrees do not give final decision to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> question, for in matters of administration of the Sacraments those in authority simply follow the safest and most conservative opinions. Morinus is followed by Tourn&eacute;ly in asserting that only the indicative form is today valid in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> (Morinus, De p&oelig;nit., Lib. VIII; Tourn&eacute;ly, ibid., do absolutionis form&acirc;); but many hold that if the deprecatory form exclude not the judicial pronouncement of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and consequently be really equivalent to the <em>ego te absolvo</em>, it is surely not invalid, though all are agreed that it would be illicit as contravening the present law and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Some, not pronouncing judgment on the real merits of the case, think that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has withdrawn faculties from those who do not use the indicative form, but in the absence of positive ordinance this is by no means certain.
<h2>Conditional absolution</h2>

<p>Antiquity makes no mention of conditional absolution. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> alludes in "De Synodo" (Bk. VII, c. xv) to a passage of Gandavensis (d. 1293), but it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether the learned pontiff caught the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>. <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> in the fifteenth century, both in "De schismate tollendo" and "De unitate ecclesi&aelig;", stands as sponsor for conditional absolution, although Cajetan, a century later, calls <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson's</a> position mere <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson's</a> position gradually obtained, and in our day all <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> grant that under certain circumstances such absolution is not only valid but also legitimate (Lehmkuhl-Gury, De p&oelig;nit., absol. sub conditione); valid, because judicial pronouncements are often rendered under certain conditions, and the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> is essentially a judicial act (Counc. of Trent, Sess. XIV); also, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> absolves in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> when certain conditions are fulfilled here below. The fulfilment may escape man's judgment, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> no man may deceive. This very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> makes conditional absolution possible. Conditions are either (a) present, (b) past, or (c) future.</p>

<p>Following a general law, whensoever the condition leaves in suspense the effect intended by the Sacrament, the Sacrament itself is null and void. If the condition does not suspend the sacramental efficacy, the Sacrament may be valid. As a consequence, all future conditions render absolution invalid: "I absolve you if you die today." This is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of conditions past or present, and absolution given, for example, on condition that the subject has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, or is still alive, would certainly not invalidate the Sacrament. What is in itself valid may not be legitimate, and in this important matter reverence due the holy Sacrament must ever be kept in mind, and also the spiritual need of the penitent. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> commonly received is that whenever conditional absolution will safeguard the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and dignity of the Sacrament it may be employed, or whenever the spiritual need of the penitent is clear, but at the same time dispositions <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the valid reception of the Sacrament are in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, then it would be a mercy to impart absolution even if under condition.
<h2>Indirect absolution</h2>

<p>Closely allied to conditional is the absolution termed indirect. It obtains whenever absolution is granted for a fault that has not been submitted to the judgment of the minister in the tribunal of penance. Forgetfulness on the part of the penitent is responsible for most cases of indirect absolution, though sometimes reservation (see <a href="../cathen/12785a.htm">RESERVED CASES</a>) may be.
<h2>Granting of absolution</h2>

<p>In virtue of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are made judges in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. The power to bind as well as the power to loose has been given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The minister therefore must have in mind not only his own powers, viz., order and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but he must also keep in mind the dispositions of the penitent. If <ul><li>(a) the penitent is well-disposed, he must absolve; <li>(b) if the penitent lack the requisite dispositions, he must endeavour to create the proper frame of mind, for he cannot and may not absolve one indisposed; <li>(c) when dispositions remain <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, he employs the privilege given above in conditional absolution.</ul>

<p>When the minister sees fit to grant absolution, then he pronounces the words of the form (<em>supra</em>) over the penitent. It is commonly taught that the penitent must be physically present; consequently, absolution by telegraph has been declared invalid, and when questioned in regard to absolution by the telephone the Sacred Congregation (1 July, 1884) answered <em>Nihil respondendum</em>.
<h2>Absolution outside the Latin Church</h2>
<h3 id="A">In the Greek Church</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the ancient <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> has been set forth above. That the Greeks have always believed that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that they believe it at present, is clear from the formul&aelig; of absolution in vogue among all branches of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; also from the decrees of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> which since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> have again and again expressed this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> (<a href="../cathen/01375a.htm">Alzog</a> on Cyril Lucaris III, 465; Synod of Constantinople, 1638; Synod of <a href="../cathen/08325b.htm">Jassy</a>, 1642; Synod of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, 1672). In the Synod of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> reiterates its <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in Seven Sacraments, among them Penance, which the Lord established when He said: "Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive they are forgiven them, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall retain they are retained." The formul&aelig; of absolution are generally deprecatory, and if now and then the indicative form appears, it may be traced to Latin sources.
<h3 id="B">Russian Church</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> is naturally also that of the Russian. Russian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> all hold that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> possesses the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, where there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance and sincere confession. The form in use at present is as follows: "My child, N. N., may our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord and God Christ Jesus</a> by the mercy of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> absolve thee from thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and I, His unworthy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in virtue of the authority committed to me, absolve thee and declare thee absolved of thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the name of the Father, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>."
<h3 id="C">Armenians</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, in his "Ritus Orientalium" (1863), gives us a full translation of the penitential ritual used by the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. The present version is from the ninth century. The form of absolution is declarative, though it is preceded by a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for mercy and for pardon. It is as follows: "May the merciful Lord have pity on thee and forgive thee thy faults; in virtue of my <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> power, by the authority and command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> expressed in these words, 'whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>', I absolve thee from thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, I absolve thee from thy thoughts, from thy words, from thy deeds, in the name of the Father, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and I restore thee to the Sacrament of the Holy Church. May all thy <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> be for thee an increase of merit, may they be for the glory of life everlasting, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>."
<h3 id="D">Copts</h3>

<p>Dr. Hyvernat asserts that the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> have no penitential formul&aelig;, nor is this surprising, for they inscribe in the ritual only those things not found in other rituals. Father du Bernat, writing to P&egrave;re Fleurian (Lettres &eacute;difiantes), says, in reference to the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> among the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> believe themselves bound to a full confession of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. This finished, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> recites over them the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> said at the beginning of the Mass, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> asking pardon and forgiveness from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to this is added the so-called "Benediction", which Father Bernat says is like the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> said in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> after absolution has been imparted. Dr. Hyvernat, however, asserts that Father Bernat is mistaken when he likens the Benediction to our <em>Passio Domini</em>, for it is like the Latin <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> only inasmuch as it is recited after absolution.
<h3 id="E">Jacobites</h3>

<p>(For the earliest <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> in the Syrian Church see above, <em>Absolution in Patristic age</em>.)

<p>The Syrians who are united with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> now use the declarative form in imparting absolution. This formula is, however, of recent date. The present Jacobite Church not only holds and has held the power to absolve from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but its ritual is expressive of this same power. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a> (Ritus Orientalium) has preserved for us a twelfth-century document which gives in full the order of absolution.
<h3 id="F">Nestorians</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> have at all times believed in the power to absolve in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. Assemani, <a href="../cathen/12769a.htm">Renaudot</a>, Badger (<a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and their Rituals), also <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, have the fullest information on this point. It is noticeable that their formula of absolution is deprecatory, not indicative.
<h3 id="G">Protestants</h3>

<p>The earliest <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> attacked virulently the penitential practice of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, particularly the confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Their opinions expressed in their later <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works do not differ as markedly from the old position as one might suppose. The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> tenet of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone would make all absolution merely declarative, and reduce the pardon granted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the merest announcement of the Gospel, especially of remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> held that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone pardoned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and he saw nothing but <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> in the practice of hoping for pardon from a mere creature. If confession had aught of good it was merely as direction. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> denied all <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sacrament when there was question of Penance; but he held that the pardon expressed by the minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gave to the penitent a greater guarantee of forgiveness. The Confession styled "Helvetian" contents itself with denying the necessity of confession to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but holds that the power granted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to absolve is simply the power to preach to the people the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel of Jesus</a>, and as a consequence the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: "Rite itaque et efficaciter ministri absolvunt dum evangelium Christi et in hoc remissionem peccatorum pr&aelig;dicant."
<h3 id="H">Anglican Church</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">"Book of Common Prayer"</a> there is a formula of Absolution in <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, at the communion service, and in the visitation of the sick. The first two are general, akin to the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> absolution in use in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>; the third is individual by the very nature of the case. Of the third absolution the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> speaks as follows: "Here shall the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> be moved to make a special confession of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if he feel his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> troubled with any weighty matter. After which confession, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall absolve him (if he humbly and heartily desire it) after this sort: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who hath left power to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to absolve all sinners who truly repent and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, of His great mercy forgive thee thine offences and by His authority committed to me, I absolve thee from all thy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in the name of the Father, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." This is the form generally employed by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> when they absolve after having heard private confessions. These formul&aelig;, even the last, are indeed vague, and in the light of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> interpretation (always excepting the advanced Ritualists) mean little more than the power to declare <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven. (Convocation, 1873; Lambeth Conference, 1877; Liddon's "Life of Pusey").

<p>The Ritualists, since the <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a> sermon of 1846, have held with more or less variance that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has granted to His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. They have also held that this power should be exercised after confession has been made to the minister of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Among Ritualists themselves some have insisted that confession to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> either <em>in re</em> or <em>in voto</em>, others have not gone to such lengths. On the discussion in the year 1898, Dr. Temple wrote a Pastoral. One may consult with profit Mashell's "Enquiry upon the Doctrine of the Anglican Church on Absolution"; Boyd's "Confession, Absolution and Real Presence"; <a href="../cathen/06370c.htm">Father Gallwey's</a> "Twelve Lectures on Ritualism" (London, 1879).
