<h1>Abstemii</h1>  

<p>An <em>abstemius</em> is one who cannot take wine without risk of vomiting. As, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> at Mass must be effected in both species, of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, an <em>abstemius</em> is consequently irregular.

<p><a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a>, following the opinion of Francisco Su&aacute;rez, teaches that such irregularity is <em>de jure divino</em>; and that, therefore, the Pope cannot dispense from it. The term is also applied to one who has a strong distaste for wine, though able to take a small quantity. A distaste of this nature does not constitute irregularity, but a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is required, in order to excuse from the use of wine at the purification of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and the ablution of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> fingers at the end of Mass. In these cases the use of wine is an ecclesiastical law from whose observance the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has power to dispense. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 13 January, 1665, grants a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> in this sense to missionaries in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, on account of the scarcity of wine; various similar rulings are to be found in the collection of the decrees of the Congregation of Rites. <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">Abstention</a> from the use of wine has, occasionally, been declared <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. It was one of the tenets of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> in the second century. <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> known as the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, forbade the use of wine, and his adherents refused to make use of it even in the Sacrament of the Altar; in its place they used water. These <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, mentioned by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103130.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I.30</a>), are known as Hydroparastes, <a href="../cathen/01660d.htm">Aquarians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>. The great <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichean heresy</a> followed a few years later. These <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, in their turn, professed the greatest possible aversion to wine, as one of the sources of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, in his book against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, ch. xlvi, says of them, "Vinum non bibunt, dicentes esse fel principum tenebrarum" &mdash; "They drink no wine, for they say it is the gall of the princes of darkness." They made use of water in celebrating Mass. At the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, one of the grievances alleged against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was that she did not allow the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to communicate under both kinds. "We excuse the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>", so runs the Augsburg Confession, "which has suffered the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of only receiving under one kind, not being able to have both; but we do not excuse the authors of this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, who maintain that it was right to forbid the administering of the complete Sacrament." How, then, were those to be admitted to the Lord's Table, who were unable to communicate under the species of wine? A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Synod of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, in 1560, reads: "The Bread of the Lord's Supper shall be administered to those who cannot drink the wine, on condition that they shall declare that they do not abstain out of contempt." Other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> also lay down the rule that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> unable to take wine shall be admitted to the Lord's Table on condition that they shall at least touch with their lips the cup which holds the species of wine; Jurieu, on the other hand, starting from the principle that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has founded the essence of the Eucharist on the two species, held that an abstemius does not receive the Sacrament, because it consists of two parts, and he receives only one. A great controversy ensued among the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> themselves on this point. <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> held that <a href="../cathen/04175a.htm">communion under both kinds</a> could not be of divine <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, since many would thereby be deprived of the Sacrament owing to a natural weakness.
