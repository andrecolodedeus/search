<h1>Abyssinia</h1>  

<h2>Geography</h2>

<p>Abyssinia, extending from the sixth to the fifteenth degree of north latitude, and situated to the south of <a href="../cathen/11147a.htm">Nubia</a>, is, by reason of its peculiar contour, unique among the countries of the African continent. It has been compared, indeed, to a vast fortress, towering above the plains of eastern Africa. It is, in fact, a huge, granitic, basaltic mass, forming a great mountainous oval, with its main ridge toward the east. A chain runs for over 650 miles from north to south; seen from the shores of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, it looks like a vast wall, some 8,000 feet high near Kasen, opposite Massowah; over 10,300 at Mount Souwaira; 11,000 at the plateau of Angolala, and more than 10,000 in Shoa. The Abyssinian chain, however, is mountainous only on the eastern side. On the other, it consists of plateaux of varying altitudes, broken up by mountains shattered by volcanic forces, the summits of which are over 6,500 feet high in Tigr&eacute;, and from 13,000 to 16,000 in Simien. A comparative depression, that of Lake Tana, hollows out the highlands to the southwest. The lake itself is at an elevation of some five thousand feet, and the neighboring plateaux, from that height to six thousand. The volcanic mass of Gojam, on the south, attains a height of more than 13,000 feet, while the peaks of Kaffa arise to an altitude of some 12,000 feet. The remarkable elevation of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> gives it a peculiar climate, and savants have classified its territory into three chief zones. That of the low valleys, or <em>kollas</em>, is a district having the Sudanese climate, great heat, and a heavy summer rainfall. The soil is sandy, dry, and stony; the crops, maize, sugar cane, and cotton. Various kinds of acacias and mimosas form the sole vegetations of these arid, unhealthy regions, whose rushing torrents of the rainy season are but stony beds during the dry. The rocks and caverns are the haunts of lions and leopards; the trees swarm with monkeys. The scattered inhabitants of these burning plains are small, withered, nervous, irritable, and quarrelsome, devoid of the dignity which marks those who live in the high lands. The middle zone, or <em>Voina-dega</em>, with an elevation of from 6,000 to 8,000 feet, is by far the largest part of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, with an equable heat little greater than that of the Mediterranean. Thus Gondar (6,000 feet) has a mean annual temperature of 19&#176; C. (66.2&#176;F), with 16&#176;C (60.8&#176;F) as the minimum of the coldest month. This is a temperature slightly higher than that of Southern <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Greece, but as, in Abyssinia, the summer is the rainy season, the heat is by no means so unbearable as the summer months of the South of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The lands of this region form a series of vast plateaux, covered with rich pasturage, the grazing ground of great herds of sheep and cattle. The air is pure and dry, the temperature moderate, water plentiful and of good quality; vines, olives, lemons, and pomegranates thrive there. Nearly the whole population of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> lives in this region. Here, too, are the cities, which are seldom found elsewhere, as the natural divisions of the country are such as keep the inhabitants in a state of patriarchal <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudalism</a>. The climate is very healthy, and sickness very infrequent. The cold zone, or <em>dega</em>, at an altitude of more than 8,000 feet, is marked by a variable temperature, and by chilly nights. The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> army at a height of 10,400 feet met with four degrees of frost on 28 March. On the heights are found the rhododendrons, mosses, and lichens of the Alps.
<h2>Ethnology</h2>

<p>Few eastern or African nations exhibit such various aspects as the aborigines. Descendants of <a href="../cathen/04575c.htm">Cush</a> are locally known as Agas, or "Freemen", and still form the basis of the Abyssinian nation. On the west, they have intermarried with the ancient Berbers, and with the blacks of the Soudan, who must not be confused with the Niger, <a href="../cathen/04228a.htm">Congo</a>, and Zambesi tribes. On the east, <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> peoples, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> and Himyarites, having crossed the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> in the fourth century B.C., conquered the whole eastern coast of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and settled chiefly in the province called, after them, Amhara. The invasion of the Galla tribes, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, spread through all this region, and especially towards the south. These invasions and mingling of races in all ages have resulted in such diversity of type that the neighboring <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> tribes never speak of the country but as <em>Habech</em> (from which the name <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> is derived), which means "a crowd" or "heap of sweepings". <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> answers to the Upper, or Eastern, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> of the ancients, and comprises four provinces: Tigr&eacute;, Amhara, Goggiam, and Shoa, four small kingdoms entrusted to as many <em>Ras</em>, or <em>Negus</em>, whence the title, <em>negus-se-n&eacute;ghest</em>, i.e., "King of Kings", assumed by the emperor of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. The whole empire contains some 4,000,000 inhabitants. According to the vague traditional legend of the "Glorious memories of the Empire", or <em>K&eacute;br&egrave;-n&eacute;ghest</em>, the dynasty of the Ethiopian kings goes back to King Solomon and Makkeda, Queen of Sheba; and by it the worship of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a> and the Mosaic law were brought to <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>. Whatever <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be in the legend, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that ancient <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> was evangelized in Apostolic times by the eunuch of Queen Candace, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Philip the deacon, but was not wholly <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> until the year 341, when St. Frumentius (<em>Keddous Faramanatos</em>), who was tutor to the emperor's two young sons, won his pupils to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It was they who made both the capital and the empire <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Nor could <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, patriarch of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, find one whom he thought better fitted to rule this infant <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, than its first apostle, Frumentius.
<h2>Christianity</h2>

<p>The whole great <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> empire did not, however, become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> at that period; since, at the very gates of Gondar, the aboriginal tribes of the Komant are <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> today, as they have been for fourteen centuries. Moreover, even the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> provinces retain, despite their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality, many traces of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and Judaic <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">atavism</a>. Even in the nineteenth century, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>, <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">fetishism</a>, serpent-worship, and the cult of various jinns, Jewish practices, rest on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and the custom of vowing children to the keeping of certain religious observances till the age of puberty are still active almost everywhere. In the sixteenth century, King Ghelaodieos found them so deeply rooted in the national habits that he tried to justify these in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as purely civil customs in no way contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. So long as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> could remain in touch with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, it was preserved from the taint of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, victorious almost everywhere else, as well as the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Macedonius and Nestorius. In the seventh century, however, the Caliph Omar, after his conquest of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, came to an understanding with the Jacobite Patriarch Benjamin, whereby the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> and the Abyssinians were forbidden all intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>, but were promised toleration on that condition. Still, the Ethiopian Church, even after the ruin of the Alexandrian Church and of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, resisted more or less successfully for nearly three centuries the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which infected all other churches of the East. Moreover, during the times of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and of Byzantine or <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Muslim</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, it became the refuge of the proscribed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Many monuments of the tenth and eleventh centuries, due to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> refugees, bear witness to this fact by their Latin character, and it is also borne out by the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Lalib&eacute;la.


<h2>Modern missions</h2>

<p>Communication between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> became more difficult, and from the end of the eleventh to the beginning of the thirteenth century one could see no bond existing between <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> and the centre of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiffs</a>, nevertheless, have bestowed a constant solicitude on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>. The first missionaries sent to their aid were the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, whose success, however, roused the fanaticism of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> against them, and caused their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. For more than a hundred years silence enfolded the ruins of this Church. At a later period, the fame of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> having spread, pilgrim <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, on their return from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, wakened once more, by what they told in the Ethiopian court, the wish to be reunited to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The Acts of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> tell of the embassy sent by the Emperor Z&eacute;ra-Jacob with the object of obtaining this result (1452). The union was brought about; but on their home journey, the messengers, while passing through <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, were given up to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, and to the Caliph, and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> before they could bring the good news to their native land. More than a hundred years later, in 1557, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Oviedo penetrated into <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>. One of his successors, Father Pa&euml;z, succeeded in <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converting</a> the Emperor Socinios himself. On 11 December, 1624, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuring</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a>, was reunited to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, a union which, unfortunately, proved to be only temporary. In 1632, the Negus <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> mounted the throne. Addicted as he was to <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> and to every vice, he showed himself the relentless enemy of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and of its moral law. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were handed over to the axe of the executioner, and <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> remained closed to the missionaries until 1702. In that year, three <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> got as far as Gondar, the capital, where they <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> several princes. The Negus wrote with his own hand to <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, professing his submission to <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">His Holiness</a>. Once more the hope <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> futile. A palace revolution overthrew the Negus, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> again assumed the reigns of power. From then until the middle of the nineteenth century, a silence as of death lay on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. In 1846, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> divided <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> into two Apostolic vicariates: that of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, trusted to the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, and that of Galla, given to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. In the former, the labors and successes of M. de Jacobus awakened the jealousy of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. An ex-Emir of Cairo, who had become Abouna of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, and a man of low birth named Kassa, who had been anointed Negus under the name of Theodoros, joined forces to persecute the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, drive out the missionaries, and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put them to death</a>. The Negus Johannes IV, who succeeded Theodoros, followed in his predecessor's footsteps. His reign of twenty years was a time of trouble and suffering for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. At last, however, Menelik, the king of Shoa, who became Negus and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in March, 1889, restored tranquility to the missions. Under his rule <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> rest assured of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and protection throughout the whole Empire of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>.
<h2>Church constitution</h2>

<p>Abyssinia is a province of the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> is a daughter of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Church, and there is nothing to show that the daughter ever really tried to withdraw herself from the maternal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Today the Abyssinians are governed as they were in the time of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, by a special delegate, who is practically the vicar of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, and is locally known as <em>Abouna</em>, or <em>Abou-Salama</em>, "Father of Peace." He has the sole <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a>, throughout <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> and in perpetuity, of anointing the Negus "King of Kings"; of consecrating <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or ordaining <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, of blessing altar-stones, of superintending <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> instruction, and of settling, as a last court of appeal, disputed or difficult questions of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> demands that the Abouna shall always be a foreigner, an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, whom the Negus obtains, or rather buys, from the Khedive and the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Cairo, the alleged successor to St. Mark in the <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">See of Alexandria</a>. Immediately after obtaining his episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, the Abouna sets out for <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, with no hope of return; but lands and large revenues ensure him a comfortable existence there. The <em>Itchagu&eacute;</em>, or Ethiopian <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, is the second religious personage in <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>. The Ethiopian <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> is forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> more than seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but there are a considerable number of secular and religious <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, recruited with little discretion, and deplorably <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. The Ethiopian Church has, in addition to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, an intermediate class, the <em>Deftaras</em>, or literati, who <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to preserve, interpret, and apply the written law, a vast collection of ordinances of the Lower Empire, modified and altered by the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> in order to ensure the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">See of Alexandria</a> over the whole of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language is the Gheez, a mixture of Greek and Arabic.

<p>Since the settlement of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> at Massowah and on the shores of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, where they have founded the colony of Erythraea, <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> has been divided into three missionary divisions. The vicariate of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, and comprising Tigr&eacute;, Amhara, and Gondar, contained, in 1904, 4,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> two churches, two <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, six <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and four native <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, with more than sixty seminarians studying Gheez at Altiniena. The Prefecture of Erythraea, in the charge of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, comprises the entire colony of that name, and contains 14,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> thirty-three churches, and fifty-one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, nine of whom are <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. The vicariate of the Gallas, in the kingdom of Shoa, and among several tribes independent of the Negus, contains 18,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and twenty churches. It is administered by twenty <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, French for the most part, and eight <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. There are in Abyssinia, 200,000 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, with much influence in the country, and filling the most important positions at court; 100,000 <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagans</a>, and 50,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The only <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who have succeeded in gaining a foothold in <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> during the nineteenth century are the missionaries of the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> National Society, who, however, may only labour in Erythraea, where they have two principal centers, at Mancullo, near Massowah, and at Geleb, as well as certain stations in Cunana land and in the province of Hamasen. Their statistics give them 380 church members. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apostolate in <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> must always exercise a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> discretion and an unfailing mildness. The missionaries will have to contend for many years against the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutychian</a> fanaticism of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and the quarrelsome nature of the inhabitants. Moreover, the frequent political revolutions of the past give little hope of settled peace and continued security.
<h2>Political revolutions, wars</h2>

<p>The Galla, or Oromo race in the south has been the terror of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> ever since the sixteenth century. The importation of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> rifles, as well as the dissensions among the Galla tribes gave an opportunity (1870) to Menelik, King of Shoa, to undertaken the conquest of all the colonies of the Oromo nation as far as Lake Victoria-Nyanza and Uganda. This conquest was not achieved until more than thirty years after the time it was undertaken.

<p>In 1846, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> appointed as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar apostolic</a> to the Galla missions Father William Massaia, an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, formerly tutor to King Humbert. The new <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> belonged to the Order of St. Francis, which was the only one that succeeded (1636-1752) in introducing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> into <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. The few apostles who braved the schismatics, however, were all <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries were beheaded at Suakin, and Blessed Agathange of Vendome and Cassianus of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> were ignominiously hanged (1638). More than a century later (1752), three other were stoned to death in a public square of Gondar. From this time, Abyssinia, as if barred from the rest of the world by a wall of iron, was an impenetrable region for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and it was almost a century later that Mgr. Massaia landed at Massowah to undertake to reanimate the old <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Ethiopians. In the disguise of a merchant, under the constant espionage of the mercenaries of the Abouna-Salama and Theodoros, now welcomed by certain chiefs, again attacked by a frenzied crowd, often bound and condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, he always contrived to escape. He left <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he conferred with <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> and Queen Victoria. Having received from them important help in his work, he returned to his mission, in September, 1853. On his arrival, he compiled a Galla dictionary, translated the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> a prince of Lagamara, vaccinated a hundred people daily during smallpox epidemic, and once more fell into the hands of Theodoros, who put him in chains. Mocked and flouted by the populace, he was thrown into a hut open to the four winds of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. His patience, however, won the esteem of Theodoros, who released him. Having been summoned by Menelik, the young King of Shoa, he gained his affection and aroused in him an admiration of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. "You have <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>," said the king to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, "and that is a wonder which neither my <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> nor my <em>deptera</em> [<a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>] can accomplish." After a fruitful apostolic mission of thirty-five years among the Galla tribes, Mgr. Massaia was created a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, and died in 1889, leaving 10,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the country.

<p>The British Counsel, Walter Plowden, a hardy adventurer, frequently gave the Negus Theodoros such timely assistance as led to his success in several <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. Plowden was assassinated, however, and his successor, Captain Charles Duncan Cameron, failed to establish a good understanding with the African emperor. Suspected of having had an understanding with the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Musselmans</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, who had just defeated Theodoros at G&eacute;daril in the Sudan, he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> (July, 1863) with some German missionaries accused of having spoken ill of the Negus. After various promises to release the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, Theodoros wound up by brutally consigning the British Consul and the members of his suite, together with some other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, tied together in pairs, to the fortress of <a href="../cathen/09523a.htm">Magdala</a>, which he had chosen as his capital. On hearing of this outrageous infringement of <a href="../cathen/09073a.htm">international law</a>, the patience of the British gave way, and they declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (July, 1867). Sir Robert Napier, who had already made a name by his victories in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, was placed in command of the troops assigned to this expedition. Colonel Merewether, whose activities in this campaign did much to win for him the rank of general, having previously reconnoitered the ground, suggested that the landing be made at Adulis in Annesley Bay. The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> army comprised 16,000 combatants, an equal number of servants, forty-five elephants, and a great many pack mules. Napier, on landing in Abyssinia, (3 January, 1868), issued a proclamation to the Ethiopians to the effect that the sole object of the invasion was to deliver the captives, and that he had nothing but friendly feelings except for those who should seek to interfere with his progress. With this, the army boldly began its march through the steep defiles of the "great <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> citadel". After marching about fifty-three miles, the vanguard reached the plateau of Senaf&eacute;, where they found a delightful climate, a temperature of 30&#176; to 40&#176;F, and a most fertile country. Word reached them that several Ras and governors of the provinces, discontented with the suspicious Theodoros, stood ready to replenish their commissary and to supply them with horses. Napier made this plateau his base of operations. He was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to cover his line of march by three entrenched camps, the first at Senaf&eacute;, the second at Addizerat, the third at Antolo. At last, on 10 April, the troops reached the slopes of Silassia without having encountered a single hostile soldier, when suddenly a cannon was fired on the heights, and 6,000 Abyssinians hurled themselves down upon the 16,000 British. The Snider rifles, however, which the British used for the first time in this engagement, quickly brought the assailants to a halt, and disabled the greater number. By 13 April, the British were beneath the walls of <a href="../cathen/09523a.htm">Magdala</a>, which surrendered after a two hours' siege. As soon as Theodoros saw the British soldiers entering the city, feeling himself abandoned by all, and conquered, he put a pistol to his mouth, and killed himself. The victorious army then released the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, whom they had hardly hoped to find alive. On 17 April, Napier, henceforth Lord Napier of <a href="../cathen/09523a.htm">Magdala</a>, ordered the inhabitants to evacuate the city, after which the walls were demolished and the public buildings given to the flames. It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to hasten the return of the troops to the sea, as the rains had already made the passage difficult. The troops embarked as they arrived at the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, on descending from the heights of Senaf&eacute;.

<p>This prompt and lucky campaign of the English was to inspire the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> twenty-eight years later to make a like bold attempt. Their <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> designs, however, roused the whole country against them, and the bloody battle of Adua (March, 1896), in which almost 20,000 were killed, put an end to their rash undertaking. In 1897, Mr. Rodd, first secretary of the British Ligation at Cairo, was entrusted with a mission to the Negus. A treaty was signed 14 May, and Menelik proclaimed the Mahdists enemies of his empire. He also asked for the adjustment of the frontiers between Harrar and Somaliland. Lastly, a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Franco</a>-<a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">Anglo</a>-<a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> agreement was concluded which guaranteed the independence of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> and assured to the three Powers bordering on the kingdom their respective <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and interests.
<h2>The Abyssinian Church</h2>

<p>The chief distinction between the Abyssinian Church and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that there is but one nature in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the divine nature and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> being in some manner unified by a species of fusion. It was in <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary's</a> womb according to some, or at the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> according to others, that the Holy Ghost effected this union. Then assuming that the two natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, human and divine, form but one, Mary is the mother of the divine as well as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of her Son, and becomes by that very fact, almost equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>. To these, so to speak, original <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, the Ethiopian Church added some of its own: e.g., the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> suffices to save their children that die unbaptized; the wholesale repudiation of all Ecumenical Councils held since the council of Ephesus, and the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/15014a.htm">traducianism</a> as an explanation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> origin. Moreover, they still retain in full force various practices of the primitive Church which have long since fallen into desuetude elsewhere: e.g., abstinence from the flesh and blood of animals that have been strangled; Baptism by immersion; the custom of administering Communion to little children under the species of wine; resting from work on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and the celebration of the <em>Agape.</em> It may be added that no church has kept to this very day a more visible imprint of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a>. Children of both sexes are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> two weeks after birth. They are then <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, girls on the eightieth and boys on the fortieth day. As in <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, they distinguish by the term "Nazarenes" children dedicated by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to the observance of certain practices or prohibitions, such as drinking hydromel and shaving the head. The canon of Scripture admitted by the Ethiopians comprises, besides the books accepted by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, certain <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> works, such as the "Book of Enoch", the "Ascension of Isaiah", etc. The oldest translation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> into Ethiopian dates from the fourth century, having been made in Gheez. Pell, Platt, and Dillman have edited some of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and Leipzig, but the majority remain untouched, in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Abyssinian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are buried in a state of deplorable <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Little is required of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> beyond the ability to read and to recite the Nicene creed, and a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> rites. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in their numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> receive an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> somewhat more complete, and occasionally there are found among them men versed in <a href="../cathen/07271a.htm">sacred hermeneutics</a>, who can recite by heart the entire <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>.
