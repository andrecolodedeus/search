<h1>Acceptance</h1>  

<p>Acceptance, in canon law, the act by which one receives a thing with <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> or satisfaction. The collation of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> is not complete till it has been accepted by him on whom it has been conferred. Acceptance is the link between the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> and the benefited. It is therefore <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to accept the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, to have <em>jus in re</em>; till the acceptance, there is at most a <em>jus ad rem</em>. (See <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">RIGHT</a>.) Acceptance is needed for the validity of an election. If the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> chosen be absent, a specified time may be given for acceptance, and a further time may be allowed to obtain the confirmation of the election to an office.

<p>Acceptance is of the essence of a gift, which, in law, means a gratuitous transfer of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Delivery of personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> with words of gift suffices; if delivery is not made, a deed or writing under seal should be executed and delivered. For the transfer of real <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, a deed is generally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. In all cases acceptance is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make the transfer binding in law. Acceptance of a law is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to impose the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of submission. Even in a democracy, where the organized people may, or should, take part in the preparation and making of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> it may not refuse to accept and to obey the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> when made and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. Otherwise the legislative authority would be a mockery, and all governmental power would vanish. We are not now posing the question whether an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> law is binding; nor are we discussing how far either custom or desuetude may take away the binding force of a law; both may imply the assent of the lawmaking power. Acceptance by the faithful is not required for the binding force of ecclesiastical laws. The Apostles received from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the power of binding and loosing, and the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> (i.e. the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>) have inherited this power, as has always been recognized in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the lawmaking power established by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will ever have the authority to make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> previous to, and independent of, the acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. If <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> should enact a law contrary to the canons, there is the remedy or an appeal to the highest authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for its annulment. <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> attacked this authority when he proclaimed, in the fifteenth thesis condemned by the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> and <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, that "no one was a temporal prince, or <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was in mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Huss</a> (ibid., Prop. 30) declared that "ecclesiastical obedience was an invention of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and outside the authority of Scripture." <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, in the proposition condemned (1521) by the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, taught that neither <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> nor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> nor any one among men has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to impose on a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> a single syllable without his full acceptance; anything otherwise done is in the spirit of tyranny. The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> favoured the theory that the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and Pope was representative of the will of the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, in 1713, condemned the 90th proposition of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>: "The Church has the power to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, to be used by the chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, with the (at least presumed) consent of the whole body." Against a natural or <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a>, no custom or desuetude can avail for the cessation of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. From a merely ecclesiastical law either custom or desuetude may withdraw the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, wherever they may properly imply the assent of the lawmaking power in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">LAW</a>, CUSTOM.)
