<h1>Acceptants</h1>  

<p>Those <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> who accepted without any reserve or <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> restriction the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Unigenitus</em>, issued in 1713 against the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> doctrines as set forth in the <em>R&eacute;flexions morales sur le Nouveau Testament</em> of the Oratorian, <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Pasquier Quesnel</a>. As is well known, the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">error of Jansenius</a> gave rise to two conflicts in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: the first, early in the second half of the seventeenth century, centred about his book <em>Augustinus</em>, and ceased with the <em>Pax Clementina</em>, also called the <em>paix fourr&eacute;e</em> or <em>False Peace</em> (1669); the second, which began with the eighteenth century, was waged around the above-mentioned work of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>. The peace too hastily granted by <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> was favourable to <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> took deep root in the French Parliaments and affected several <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Fathers of Christian Doctrine</a>, Genevievans, and especially <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>. Attention was called to the spread of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by the success of the <em>R&eacute;flexions morales</em>. This work, published as a small volume in 1671 with the approval of Vialart, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne</a>, had been steadily enlarged in succeeding editions until, in 1693, it numbered four compact volumes bearing always the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of Vialart, who died in 1680. <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">De Noailles</a>, the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, sanctioned the work in 1695, but the following year, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he condemned it. The edition of 1699 was published without the changes demanded by <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, without the preface which he composed for it, and without the approval of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The following year (2 July, 1700) the anonymous work <em>Probl&egrave;me eccl&eacute;siastique, etc.</em>, and the controversies to which it gave rise, again drew attention to the peril of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. At the Assembly of the French Clergy, in the same year, <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> brought about the condemnation of four <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> propositions and of 127 others of lax morality. After the death of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> (1704), <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> led the contest against <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and especially against the distinction between "fact" and "right" (<em>fait et droit</em>). Finally, at the request of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, and following the example of his predecessors, <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> condemned in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Vineam Domini</em> (1705) the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> evasion known as <em>silentium obsequiosum</em>, or respectful silence, and proscribed (1708) the <em>R&eacute;flexions morales</em>. Shortly afterwards, the King caused the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> establishment of Port-Royal to be demolished (1710). <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, however, had not yet been overthrown. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> then urged the Pope (November, 1711) to publish another <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, and promised to have it accepted with due respect by the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. On this assurance <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> established a special congregation to draw up the new constitution. After eighteen months of careful study, the famous <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Unigenitus</em>, destined soon to provoke an outburst of wrath on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (8 September, 1713). In it the Pope condemned 101 propositions from <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel's</a> book as "false, misleading, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a>, suspected and savouring of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, bordering upon <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, frequently condemned; what is more, as being <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and reviving various propositions of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, in the very sense for which they were first proscribed." <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> at first submitted, but later, in an assembly of forty-nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who met at the instance of <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he recalled his submission and with eight of his colleagues ranged himself among the <em>appelants</em>. The forty others voted to accept. The Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> registered the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> (15 February, 1714), and the Sorbonne did the same, albeit under pressure of royal authority. The French Episcopate, with the exception of twenty hesitating or stubborn members, submitted forthwith. To make an end of the matter, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, at <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon's</a> suggestion, conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of holding a national council as a means of restoring unity; but his death prevented this and deferred the hour of final pacification.

<p>The Regent, Philip of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, a man without religious or moral convictions, a "vicious braggart", as <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> styled him, attempted to hold the balance between the two parties. The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> profited by his neutrality. <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> was put at the head of a "conseil de conscience pour les affaires eccl&eacute;siastiques", and four <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the Sorbonne who had been exiled because of their violent opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> were recalled. The Sorbonne, which had accepted the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Unigenitus</em> by a mere majority, now cancelled its acceptance (1716). The Pope through a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> punished the Sorbonne by depriving it of all its privileges. The Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> sided with the Faculty and suppressed the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, while the Sorbonne itself contested the right of the Sovereign Pontiff to withdraw lawfully granted privileges. The following year four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Soanen of Senez, <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm#III">Colbert of Montpellier</a>, de la Broue of Mirepoix, and de Langle of Boulogne, appealed from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Unigenitus</em> to a future general council. Their example was followed by sixteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, ninety-seven <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, a number of cures of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>, Genevievans, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of Saint-Maur, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, members of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and even lay people. This movement extended to the provinces, but not to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, all of which, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, supported the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Papal Bull</a>. Of the 100,000 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> then in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, hardly 3,000 were among the <em>appelants</em>, and 700 of these were in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The great majority voted for acceptance and counted on their side more than 100 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <em>appelants</em> had only 20 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he must act vigorously. He had used every means of persuasion and had written to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> beseeching him to set the example of submission. He even consented to a delay. But the opposition was unyielding. It was then that the Pope published the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Pastoralis Officii</em> (28 August, 1718), in which he pronounced <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> upon all who opposed the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Unigenitus</em>. The same year, 2 October, <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> and his party appealed from this second <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, and the Faculties of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, headed by the famous <a href="../cathen/13119b.htm">Rollin</a>, endorsed the appeal. The Regent thought it time to intervene. He was indifferent to the question of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, but was politic enough to see that censorious people like the <em>appelants</em> were no less dangerous to the State than to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Moreover, his old teacher, the Abb&eacute; Dubois, now his Prime Minister, with an eye perhaps to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat, was in favour of peace. He caused to be composed a <em>Corps de Doctrine</em> (1720) explaining the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Unigenitus</em>, and about one hundred <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> gave their adhesion to it. <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> then accepted the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> (19 November, 1720), "following the explanations which have been approved of by a great number of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>." This ambiguous and uncertain submission did not satisfy <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>; he died, however, without having obtained anything more definite.

<p>Louis XV and his aged minister, the Cardinal de Fleury, opposed the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> with vigour. Authorized by them, <a href="../cathen/14505a.htm">De Tencin</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Embrun, convoked a provincial council (1727) to examine Soanen, the aged <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Senez, who in a pastoral instruction had gone to extremes. Many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> took part in this council, notably De Belzunce, famous for the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he displayed during the plague of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. Although supported by twelve <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and fifty advocates, Soanen was <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspended</a> and sent to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Chaise-Dieu where he died, insubordinate, at the age of ninety-three. After numerous evasions, ending in submission, <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Noailles</a> died in 1729. The only <em>appelants</em> left were the Bishops <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm#III">Colbert of Montpellier</a>, Caylus of Auxerre, and Bossuet of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, a nephew of the great <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bishop of Meaux</a>. At the same time 700 <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, of whom thirty-nine were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, ratified the earlier (1714) acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Unigenitus</em>. It was a triumph for the <em>acceptants</em>, that is to say, for the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
