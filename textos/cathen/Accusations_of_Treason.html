<h1>Accusations of Treason</h1>  

<p>A common misrepresentation concerning the Elizabethan <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of English and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from 1570 onwards is the statement that the victims devoted to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, torture, and death suffered not for their religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> but for treason against the queen and her government. This view, officially <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by Elizabeth's lord high treasurer, William Cecil, Lord Burghley, in 1583, was constantly reiterated by the judges in the courts, by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers in their controversial works, and has thence made its way into popular manuals of history. At the present day it frequently reappears as one of the stock accusations brought against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> controversialists of various types.

<p>The simple fact that in very many instances those condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> ostensibly for treason were offered their lives and liberty if they would attend <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> worship, shows conclusively that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> did in fact suffer for religion; but at this epoch religion and politics were so inextricably confused that this explanation, though valid in the case of individual <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, does not suffice to meet the general accusation. As a recent <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> historian writes: "The vexed question whether the Romanists died for treason or for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> implies an antithesis which had little meaning in that age of mingled politics and religion" (A.F. Pollard, "Political History of England", VI, 377). Everything centres round the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of Elizabeth by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>, 25 February, 1570. This act created a situation full of perplexity for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It even underlies the history of the rising of the northern earls in 1569, for when they rose they had reason to believe that the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> had already taken place. Harassed as they were, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> would take no steps in defence of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> till the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> declared that Elizabeth's misgovernment had so infringed the spiritual liberty of her subjects as to absolve them from their allegiance. Once this declaration was made a number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> acted on it, and there was a certain section who under the influence of Mendoza and others were implicated in plots against Elizabeth which were undoubtedly treasonable from the Government's point of view. But they might well have urged that in so assailing the royal power they were doing no more against Elizabeth than Bolingbroke had done against Richard II, or Richmond against Richard III. Yet neither Henry IV nor Henry VII are usually branded as "traitors".

<p>The subsequent cases of Pym and Hampden, not to mention the successful <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">revolutionaries of 1688</a>, show that success or failure is often made the real test between treason and rebellion. That a certain party of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was in rebellion against Elizabeth is not disputed, but justified rebellion ceases to be treason and may be the noblest patriotism. Thus Allen with many of the exiles of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> and <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Persons</a> with many of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, saw in the rule of Elizabeth a greater danger to the highest interests of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> than had previously been threatened in cases where history had justified the deposition of kings. And the supreme authority had sanctioned this view. Moreover, such exercise of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> prerogative was one of the recognized principles of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> throughout which it had served to protect the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the people. This became evident later, when, after the decline of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power, the autocratic power of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> sovereigns was greatly increased and always at the expense of the people. Nevertheless, it remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in the eyes of Elizabeth and her <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> such opposition was nothing less than high treason. But a large number of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> refused to go so far as rebellion. The historian already quoted admits that the opposition which relied on avowedly treasonable methods was "limited to extremists" (ibid., 297). Elsewhere he says of the rank and file of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>: "They tried to ignore their painful dilemma between two forms of allegiance, for both of which they had deep respect" (p. 370). As <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a> writes: "among the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (the bull) served only to breed <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>, dissensions, and dismay. Many contended that it had been issued by an incompetent authority; others that it could not bind the natives till it should be carried into actual execution by some foreign power; all agreed that it was in their regard an imprudent and cruel expedient, which rendered them liable to the suspicion of disloyalty, and afforded their enemies a presence to brand them with the name of traitors" (ibid., 225).

<p>The terrible strain of this dilemma was relieved by the next <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, who on 14 April 1580, issued a declaration that though Elizabeth and her abettors remained subject to the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, it was not to bind <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to their detriment. The large majority of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were relieved in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> by this <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, and never gave the Government the least ground for suspecting their loyalty, but they persisted in the practice of their religion, which was made possible only by the coming of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. With regard to these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who entered <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at the risk of their lives to preserve the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion and to give facilities for Mass and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> there could be no presumption of treason by the ancient <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. But in the panic which followed the Northern Rising, Parliament had passed a statute (13 Eliz. c. 2) declaring it to be high treason to put into effect any <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> to absolve or reconcile any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to be absolved or reconciled, or to procure or publish any <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> or writing whatsoever. Thus for the first time purely religious acts were declared by Parliament to be treasonable, a position which no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> could admit. It is clear that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> suffering under such a law as this suffered for religion and not for treason. Elizabeth's Government, however, for its own purposes refused to make any distinction between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had been engaged in open opposition to the queen and those who were forced by <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to ignore the provisions of this statute of 1571. These two classes, really distinct, were purposely identified by the Government and treated as one for controversial purposes. For when the reports of so many bloody executions for religion began to horrify <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the queen's <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> adopted the defence that their severity was not exercised against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as such, but as traitors guilty of treason against their sovereign.



<p>This view was put forward officially in a pamphlet by Lord Burghley, which was not only published in English but translated into Latin and other languages for foreign circulation. The very title of this work indicates its scope: "The Execution of Justice in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for maintenance of public and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peace, against certain stirrers of sedition and adherents to the traitors and enemies of the realm without any <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of them for questions of religion, as is falsely reported, and published by the fautors and fosterers of their treasons." This pamphlet, which was issued on 17 December, 1583, may briefly be summarized. Attention is first drawn to late rebellions in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> which had been suppressed by the queen's power. Whereupon some of the defeated rebels had fled into foreign countries and there alleged that they were suffering for religion. Great stress is laid upon the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; and all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> living abroad are represented as engaged in seditious practices with a view to carrying the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> into effect. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> are exhibited merely as foundations established to assist in this disloyal object. They have been "erected to nurse seditious fugitives". The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who came forth at the risk of their lives are not given credit for any religious purpose, but "the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> fugitives come secretly into the realm to induce the people to obey the Pope's bull". This view is important as it shows the pretext put forth by the Government to defend the Act of 1585 by which it became high treason for any <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> simply to come to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The pamphlet proceeds to declare that some of these "sowers of sedition" have been taken, convicted, and executed "not being dealt withal upon questions of religion, but justly condemned as traitors". They were so condemned "by the ancient realm made 200 years past". Moreover, if they retracted their treasonable opinions their lives were spared. As "the foreign traitors continue sending of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to move sedition in the realm" who cloak their real object of enforcing the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> under the pretext of religion and who "labour to bring the realm into a war external and domestical", it becomes the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the queen and her <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> to repel such rebellious practices. Burghley insists that before the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> no one had been charged with capital crimes on the ground of religion, and brings everything back to the question of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. "And if then it be inquired for what cause these others have of late suffered death it is truely to be answered as afore is often remembered that none at all are impeached for treason to the danger of their life but such as do obstinately maintain the contents of the Pope's <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> aforementioned, which do import that her Majesty is not the lawful Queen of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the first and highest point of treason, and that all her subjects are discharged of their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> and obedience, another high point of treason. and all warranted to disobey her and her <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> a third and very large point of treason."

<p>A fourth point is taken from the refusal of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to disavow the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> proceedings in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. After many other points some of an historical nature addressed to foreign princes the writer anticipates the objection that many sufferers had been simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and unarmed scholars. He says "Many are traitors though they have no armour nor weapon." Such people are like spies, "necessary accessaries and adherents proper to further and continue all rebellions and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. . . . The very causes final of these rebellions and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> have been to depose her Majesty from her crown: the causes instrumental are these kind of <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and seedmen of sedition. The pamphlet ends by proposing six questions or tests by which traitors might be distinguished from simple scholars. These interrogatories, known later as "the bloody questions", were ingeniously framed to entangle the victim into admissions with regard to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> action in <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> Elizabeth, which might be construed as treason. This is the government case and it was promptly answered by Allen in his "Answer to the Libel of English Justice", published in 1584, in which he joins issue on all points, showing "that many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> have been <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, condemned and executed for mere matter of religion and for transgression only of new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> which make cases of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to be treason without all pretence or surmise of any old treasons or <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> for the same". He defends <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> from the imputation of treason, points to the oppression of the Government and the prudent attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with regard to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>; he explains the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and deprivation of princes, the advantages of having a supreme authority to decide between princes and people in causes involving questions of deprivation; defends the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> action in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and concludes by showing "that the separation of the prince and realm from the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> and See Apostolic and fall from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion is the only cause of all the present fears and dangers that the State seemeth to stand in. And that they <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> attribute the same to the Pope's Holiness or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and untruly call them the enemies of the Realm".

<p>In the following year, 1585, the Government took another step forward in their policy of drawing religious and indifferent acts into the political net. This was the statute 27 Eliz. c. 2, by which it was made high treason for any <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> or any <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> even to be in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and felony for anyone to harbour or relieve them. Even so biased an historian as David Hume realized the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of this measure of which he says: "In the subsequent part of the queen's reign the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was sometimes executed by the capital punishment of priests; and though the partisans of that princess asserted that they were punished for their treason, not their religion, the apology must only be understood in this sense, that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was enacted on account of the treasonable views and attempts of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, not that every individual who suffered the penalty of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was convicted of treason" (Hist. of Eng., sub an 1584). The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> themselves constantly protested against this accusation of treason, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the queen on the scaffold. In very many instances they were offered a free pardon if they would attend the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church, and some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> unfortunately yielded to the temptation. But the fact of the offer being made sufficiently shows that religion, not treason, was the ground of their offence. This is notably the case with regard to <a href="../cathen/14697a.htm">Blessed Thomas Percy</a> who had himself been the leader of the Northern Rising and who yet was offered his liberty at the price of conformity. There are three <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> directly connected with the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, Felton, <a href="../cathen/08485b.htm">Storey</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14698a.htm">Woodhouse</a>, who for that reason stand in a class apart from the other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; their cases have received special treatment by Father Pollen, S.J. (Camm's "Lives of the English Martyrs", II, xvii-xxii). It may not be amiss to state that so careful is the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in such questions that the cause of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of James Laborne has been postponed for more careful consideration simply because of certain words he uttered about the queen. With regard to all the other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> there is no difficulty in showing that they died for their religion, and that the accusation of treason in their regard is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and unfounded.
