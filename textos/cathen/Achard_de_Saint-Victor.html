<h1>Achard de Saint-Victor</h1>  

<p>Canon regular, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Victor, Paris, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avranches, b. about 1100; d. 1172. By some authorities he is said to have been of English extraction, by others to be of the noble Norman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of de Pertins, of Domfront. He completed his studies at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St-Victor's and entered the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> there. On the death (1155) of the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Gilduin, he was elected to fill the vacant post, at a time when the royal <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was almost at the zenith of its glory and power. Two years later the Cathedral Chapter of <a href="../cathen/13681d.htm">S&eacute;ez</a>, composed of canons regular, elected Achard for their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the choice was duly confirmed by <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a>. But Henry II intervened and intruded his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> Frogier, or Roger. However, subsequent relations between Achard and the Plantagenet were quite cordial, and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> used his influence at the English Court to compel the royal treasurer, Richard of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, to disemburse for the benefit of the poor some moneys which he was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> detaining; his letter to Henry II on the matter is still extant. When, in 1162, Achard was raised to the vacant See of Avranches, henry made no objection to his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and that same year Bishop Achard stood godfather to his daughter Elinor born at Domfront. But the French king, Louis VII, was by no means pleased to see such a shining light of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> Church pass over into Norman territory, as is evident from a letter he then addressed to the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of St-Victor's. In 1163 Achard was in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> assisting at the solemn translation of Edward the Confessor in <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a>.

<p>The chief monument of his ten years' episcopate was the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Abbey of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, the foundation stone of which he laid 91164) and where at his own request he was buried, with this simple inscription: "Hic jacet Achardus episcopus cujus caritate ditata est paupertas nostra." His brethren of St-Victor's celebrated his memory in the following lines: "Huju oliva domus, Anglorum gloria cleri&mdash;Jam dignus celesti luce foveri&mdash;Felix Achardus florens etate senile&mdash;Presul Abrincensis ex hoc signature ovili". Not the least gem in Achard's crown is the memory of his unwavering friendship for St. Thomas a Becket through all the years of his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. In the chronicles of St-Victor's Achard is termed "Blessed". One treatise (Latin original and eighteenth-century French translation) of Achard's is extant in the Bibliotheque Nationale. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It is a long commentary or sermon on the Temptation of Christ in the wilderness, and in it Achard discusses seven degrees of self-renunciation, which he calls the seven <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Haur&eacute;au in his "Histoire literaire du maine", I, quotes several passages and terms the tract vrai morceau de style.
