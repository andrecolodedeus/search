<h1>Achrida</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> in Upper <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albania</a>, the famous <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> and capital of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, now the little village of Ochrida, on the Lake of Ochrida, the ancient <em>Lacus Lychnitis</em>, whose blue and exceedingly transparent waters in remote antiquity gave to the lake its Greek name. The city was known in antiquity as Lychnidus and was so called occasionally in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. In the conflicts of the <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyrian</a> tribes with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> it served the former as a frontier outpost and was later one of the principal points on the great Roman highway known as the via Egnatiana. Its first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Zosimus (c. 344). In the sixth century it was destroyed by an earthquake (Procop., Hist. Arcana, xv), but was rebuilt by <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a> (527-565), who was born in the vicinity, and is said to have been called by him Justiniana Prima, i.e. the most important of the several new cities that bore his name. Duchesne, however, says that this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> belongs to Scupi (Uskub), another frontier town of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> (Les &eacute;glises s&eacute;par&eacute;es, Paris, 1856, 240). The new city was made the capital of the prefecture, or department, of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>, and for the sake of political convenience it was made also the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> capital of the Illyrian or Southern Danubian parts of the empire (Southern <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>). Justinian was unable to obtain immediately for this step a satisfactory <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> from <a href="../cathen/01202c.htm">Pope Agapetus</a> or <a href="../cathen/13793a.htm">Pope Silverius</a>. The Emperor's <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, besides being a usurpation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, was a detriment to the ancient <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> as representative of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> in the Illyrian regions. Nevertheless, the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> claimed, and obtained in fact, the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of <em>autocephalia</em>, or independence, and through its long and chequered history retained, or struggled to retain, this character. <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a>, under pressure from Justinian, recognized the exercise of patriarchal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Justiniana Prima within the broad limits of its civil territory, but <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> treated him as no less subject than other Illyrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> (Duchesne, op. cit., 233-237). The inroads of the Avars and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> in the seventh century brought about the ruin of this ancient Illyrian centre of religion and civilization, and for two centuries its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> character was in abeyance. But after the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> masters of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> (864) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> rose again to great prominence, this time under the name of Achrida (Achris). Though Greek missionaries were the first to preach the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> in this region, the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was sent by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was thence also that the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> drew their first official instruction and counsel in matters of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, a monument of which may be seen in the <em>Responsa ad Consulta Bulgarorum</em> of <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> (858-867), one of the most influential of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> canonical documents (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, xv, 401; <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, Concilieng., iv, 346 sq.). However, the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> King (Car) Bogaris was soon won over by Greek influence. In the <a href="../cathen/04310b.htm">Eighth General Council</a> held at Constantinople (869) <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> was incorporated with the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, and in 870 the Latin missionaries were expelled. Henceforth Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> preside in Achrida; it was made the political capital of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> kingdom and profited by the tenth-century conquests of its warlike rulers so that it became the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of several Greek <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the newly conquered territories in <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, Thessaly, and Thrace. <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> fell unavoidably within the range of the <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and so, from the end of the ninth century, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Achrida was lost to <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western</a> and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> influences. The overthrow of the independent <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> kingdom in the early part of the eleventh century by Basil the Macedonian brought Achrida into closer touch with Constantinople. At a later date some of the great Byzantine <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> (e.g. the Ducas and the Comneni) claimed descent from the Kings, or Cars, of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>. In 1053 the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Leo of Achrida signed with <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael Caerularius</a> the latter's circular letter to John of <a href="../cathen/15016d.htm">Trani</a> (Apulia in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>) against the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. Theophylactus of Achrida (1078) was one of the most famous of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a>; in his correspondence (Ep., 27) he maintains the traditional independence of the Diocese of Achrida. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople, he says, has no right of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is independent. In reality Achrida was during this period seldom in communion with either Constantinople or <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Towards the latter see, however, its sentiments were less than friendly, for in the fourteenth century we find the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Anthimus of Achrida writing against the procession of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from the Father <a href="../cathen/06073a.htm">and the Son</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">TRINITY</a>). Latin missionaries, however, appear in Achrida in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, mostly <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, to whom the preservation of the Roman obedience in these regions is largely owing (see <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">ALBANIA</a>). The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Achrida in the seventeenth century are probably, like those of our own time, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> independence of Achrida seeming in modern times to leave an opening for <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> influence in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01754a.htm">Arsenius</a>, the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, had it finally abolished in 1767 by an order of Sultan Mustapha. At the height of its authority, Achrida could count as subject to its authority ten <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and six episcopal <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.
