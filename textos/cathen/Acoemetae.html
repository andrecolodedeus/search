<h1>Acoemetae</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>akoimetai</em>, from privative <em>a</em> and <em>koiman</em>, to rest).

<p>Sometimes, an appellation common to all <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetics</a> known by the rigour of their vigils; but usually, the name of a special order of Greek or <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> devoting themselves to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and praise without intermission, day and night. That order was founded, about the year 400, by a certain Alexander, a man of noble birth, who fled from the court of Byzantium to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, both from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of solitude and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of episcopal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a>. When he returned to Constantinople, there to establish the <em>laus perennis</em>, he brought with him the experience of a first foundation on the Euphrates and three hundred <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The enterprise, however, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> difficult, owing to the hostility of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Patriarch Nestorius</a> and <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>. Driven from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Mennas which he had reared in the city, and thrown with his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> on the <a href="../cathen/07475c.htm">hospitality</a> of St. Hypathius, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Rufiniana, he finally succeeded in building at the mouth of the Black Sea the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Gomon, where he died, about 440. His successor, Abbot John, founded on the eastern shore of the Bosphorus, opposite Sostenium or Istenia, the Irenaion, always referred to in ancient documents as the "great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>" or motherhouse of the Acoemetae. Under the third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, St. Marcellus, when the hostility of Patriarch and Emperor had somewhat subsided, Studius, a former Consul, founded in the city the famous <a href="../cathen/14316c.htm">"Studium"</a> which later, chiefly under <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">Abbot Theodore</a> (759-826), became a centre of learning as well as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and brought to a culmination the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the order. On the other hand, the very glamour of the new "Studites" gradually cast into the shade the old Acoemetae. The feature that distinguished the Acoemetae from the other <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was the uninterrupted service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, which numbered hundreds of inmates and sometimes went into the thousand, were distributed in national groups, Latins, Greeks, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>; and each group into as many choirs as the membership permitted and the service required: With them the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">divine office</a> was the literal carrying out of <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a>: "Seven times a day have I given praise to Thee," consisting as it did of seven hours: <em>orthrinon, trite, ekte, enate, lychnikon, prothypnion, mesonyktion</em>, which through <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict of Nursia</a> passed into the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> under the equivalent names of <a href="../cathen/12424a.htm">prime</a>, <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">tierce</a>, <a href="../cathen/13747c.htm">sext</a>, <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">none</a>, <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">vespers</a>, <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">compline</a>, <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">matins</a> (nocturns) and <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">lauds</a>. The influence of the Acoemetae on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life was considerable. The splendour of their religious services largely contributed to shape the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <em>laus perennis</em> and similar institutions, passed into the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> with <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> of Agaune and St. Denys. Our modern <a href="../cathen/01152a.htm">perpetual adoration</a> is a remnant of it. Even before the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of the Studites, the copying of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> was in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> among the Acoemetae, and the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the "Great Monastery," consulted even by the Roman Pontiffs, is the first mentioned by the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">historians</a> of Byzantium. The Acoemetae took a prominent part &#151; and always in the sense of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> &#151; in the <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> discussions raised by Nestorius and <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, and later, in the controversies of the Icons. They <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> strong supporters of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Acacius, as did the Studites in that of <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a>. The only flaw which marred the purity of their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and their loyalty to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, occurred in the sixth century, when, the better to combat the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutychian</a> tendencies of the Scythian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, they themselves fell into the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and had to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08421b.htm">Pope John II</a>. But it was the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of a few (<em>quibusdam paucis monachis</em>, says a contemporary document), and it could not seriously detract from the praise given their order by the Roman <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of 484: "Thanks to your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> ever on the watch, and to a special <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, you discern the just from the impious, the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> from the miscreants, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>."
