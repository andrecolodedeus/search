<h1>Acolyte</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>akolouthos</em>; Latin <em>sequens, comes</em>, a follower, an attendant).

<p>An acolyte is a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> promoted to the fourth and highest <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor order</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, ranking next to a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>. The chief offices of an acolyte are to light the <a href="../cathen/01347a.htm">candles on the altar</a>, to carry them in procession, and during the solemn singing of the Gospel; to prepare wine and water for the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a>; and to assist the sacred <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> at the Mass, and other public services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of an acolyte the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presents him with a <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candle</a>, extinguished, and an empty <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a>, using appropriate words expressive of these <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Altar boys are often designated as acolytes and perform the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of such. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the acolyte in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services are fully described in the manuals of liturgy, e.g. Pio Matinucci, "Manuale Sacrarum Caeremoniarum" (Rome, 1880), VI, 625; and De Herdt, "Sacrae Liturgiae Praxis" (Louvain, 1889), II, 28-39.

<p>It is just possible that the obscure passage in the life of Victor I (189-199), <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> attributed by <a href="../cathen/06048a.htm">Ferraris</a> (I, 101) to <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius I</a> (140-155), concerning <em>sequentes</em> may really mean acolytes (Duchesne, Lib. Pont., I, 137; cf. I, 161). Be this as it may, the first authentic document extant in which mention is made of acolytes is a letter (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.43</a>), written in 251, by <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> to Fabius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and in which we possess a definite enumeration of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. There existed at that time in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> forty-six <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, seven sub-deacons, forty-two acolytes, and fifty-two <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, and doorkeepers. It is worthy of note that two hundred and fifty years later the "Constitutum Silvestri," a document of about 501 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Coll. Conc., " II, 626; cf. "Lib. Pont.," ed. Duchesne, Introd., 138), gives forty-five acolytes as the number in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Pope Fabian (236-250), the immediate predecessor of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, had divided <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> into seven <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> districts or regions, setting a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> over each one. A redistribution of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the city soon followed according to these seven divisions. The Roman acolytes were subject to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the region, or, in case of his absence or death, to the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>. In each region there was a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, and according to the numeration above, probably six acolytes. Ancient <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> monuments and documents lead us to believe that a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> was a sort of head-acolyte or arch-acolyte, holding the same relation to the acolytes as the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> to <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, with this difference, however, that there was only one <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, while there was a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> for each region. As late as the first half of the tenth century we meet with the term arch-acolyte in Luitprand of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a> ("Antapodosis", VI, 6; Muratori, "SS. Rer. Ital.", II, 1, 473), where it stands for a "dignity" (q.v.) in the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>. We may therefore regard the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> and acolyte as a development of that of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Moreover, these three categories of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> differ from the lower orders in this, that they are all attached to the service of the altar, while the others are not.

<p>The letters of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (7, 28, 34, 52, 59, 78, 79) give ample <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the fact that at Carthage also, in the middle of the third century, acolytes existed. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (De Vita Constant., III, 8) mentions the acolytes present at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nice</a> (325), not as designated for the service of the altar, but as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> attached to the retinue of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The "Statuta Ecclesiae Antiqua", often referred to as the decrees of the so-called Fourth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Synod of Carthage</a> (398), but really belonging to the end of the fifth, or the early part of the sixth, century (Duchesne, "Christian Worship", 332, 350), prove that this order was then known in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Arles in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, where these decrees were enacted. It would seem, however, that all the churches in the West, and more especially the smaller churches, did not have acolytes. We might conclude that at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, in the fifth century, there were no acolytes, if we could attach credence to the will of Bishop Bennadius, predecessor of <a href="../cathen/12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a>. He gives all the categories of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> except this one (<a href="../cathen/06105a.htm">Flodoard</a>, Hist. Rem. Eccl., I, ix, in P.L., LXXXV, 43). In the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> epigraphy of Gaul mention is made, as far as is known, of only one acolyte, viz., at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 517 (La Blant, "Inser. chr&eacute;t. de la Gaule," I, 36), and, in general, very few epigraphs of acolytes are found in the first five centuries. In the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Collection of Canons (Collectio Canonum Hibernensis, ed. Wasserschleben, Giessen, 1874, 32) the arch-acolyte is not mentioned among the seven <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> degrees, but placed with the psalmist and cantor outside the ordinary <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>.



<p>In the sixth canon of the aforementioned "Statuta" the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of acolytes are specified, as they are by a contemporary writer, <a href="../cathen/08491a.htm">John the Deacon</a>, in his letter to Senarius (P.L., LIX, 404). Specific information concerning the place and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of acolytes in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> between the fifth and ninth centuries is drawn from a series of ancient directions known as the "Ordines Romani" (q.v.-Duchesne, op. Cit., 146 and <em>passim</em>). According to them there were in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (perhaps also in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and other large Western cities) three classes of acolytes, all of whom, nevertheless, had their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in relation to the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> synaxes or assemblies: (1) those of the palace (<em>palatini</em>), who served the Pope (or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>) in his palace, and in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>; (2) those of the region (<em>regionarii</em>), who assisted the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in the different parts of the city; (3) those of the station (<em>stationarii</em>), who served in church; these last were not a distinct body, but belonged to the regional acolytes. Regional acolytes were also termed titular (<em>titulares</em>) from the church to which they were attached (Mabillon, "Comm. in Ord. Rom.", in his "Musaeum Italicum," II, 20; for an old epigraph in Aringhius, 156, see <a href="../cathen/06048a.htm">Ferraris</a>, I, 100; Magani, "Antica Lit. Rom.", <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1899, III, 61 - see also <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">CITY OF ROME</a>. Acolytes of the palace were destined in a particular manner to the service of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, assisting him not only in church functions, but also as ablegates, messengers of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court, in distributing <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, carrying pontifical documents and notices, and performing other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of like character. These offices, however, acolytes shared with readers and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, or arch-acolytes. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> they carried not only the <a href="../cathen/05603b.htm">eulogia</a>, or blessed bread, when occasion required, but also the Blessed Eucharist from the Pope's Mass to that of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to celebrate in the churches (tituli). This is evident from the letter of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> (401-417) to Decentius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (P.L., XX, 556). They also carried the sacred species to the absent, especially to confessors of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> detained in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> (see <a href="../cathen/14461a.htm">TARSICIUS</a>). This office of carrying the Blessed Eucharist, <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>, who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> about 165 or 166, had previously assigned to <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> (Apolog., I, 67), which would indicate that at that time acolytes did not exist.

<p>We learn still further from the "Ordines Romani" that when the Pope was to pontificate in a designated district all the acolytes of that region went to the Lateran Palace to receive and accompany him. In the sixth or seventh century, perhaps a little earlier, the chief acolyte of the stational church, carrying the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">sacred chrism</a> covered with a veil, and, directing the procession, preceded on foot the horse on which the Pope rode. The other acolytes followed, carrying the Gospel-book, burses, and other articles used in the holy sacrifice. They accompanied the Pope to the secretarium or <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">BASILICA</a>). One of them solemnly placed the book of Gospels upon the altar. They carried seven lighted <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candles</a> before the pontiff entering the sanctuary. With lighted <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candles</a>, two acolytes accompanied the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a> for the singing of the Gospel. After the Gospel, another acolyte received the book, which, placed in a case and sealed, was later returned to the Lateran by the head acolyte. An acolyte carried to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at the altar, the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and pall; acolytes received, and cared for, the offerings gathered by the Pope; an acolyte held the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a>, covered with a veil, from the beginning to the middle of the canon. In due time acolytes bore, in linen bags, or burses suspended from their necks, the <em>oblata</em>, or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> loaves from the altar to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the sanctuary; that they might break the sacred species (see <a href="../cathen/06165a.htm">FRACTIO PANIS</a>). It will be seen from these, and other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> devolving upon acolytes, that they were in a large measure responsible for the successful carrying out of pontifical and stational ceremonies. This was particularly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> after the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/13547b.htm">Schola Cantorum</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, of which there is clear evidence from the seventh century onward. Being then the only ones in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> engaged in active ministry, acolytes acquired a much greater importance than they had hitherto enjoyed. <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal priests</a> had no other assistants in their titular churches. During <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and at the solemnization of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, acolytes fulfilled all the functions which hitherto had devolved upon the <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> had absorbed those of the <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> or reader. <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> (1655-67) abolished the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> college of acolytes described above and substituted in their place (26 October, 1655) the twelve voting <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the Signature of Justice. As evidence of their origin these <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> still retain, at <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> functions, many of the offices or <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> described above.

<p>According to the ancient <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> the order of acolyte was conferred as the candidate approached adolescence, about the age of twenty, as the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> (385) to Himerius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, was interpreted (P.L., XIII, 1142). Five years were to elapse before an acolyte could receive <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeaconship</a>. <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> reduced (418) this term to four years. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> leaves to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to determine what space should elapse between the conferring of the acolythate and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeaconship</a>; it is also interesting to note, with Dr. Probst (Kirchenlex., I, 385), that the Council's desire (Sess. XXIII, c. 17, de ref.) concerning the performance of ministerial services exclusively by <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor-order</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> was never fulfilled. In ancient <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> there was no solemn <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of acolytes. At communion-time in any ordinary Mass, even when it was not stational, the candidate approached the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, or in his absence, one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the pontifical court. At an earlier moment of the Mass he had been vested with the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>. Holding in his arms a linen bag (<em>porrigitur in ulnas ejus sacculus super planetam</em>; a symbol of the highest function of these <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, that of carrying, as stated above, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> hosts) he prostrated himself while the Pontiff pronounced over him a simple blessing (Mabillon, op. Cit., II, 85, ed. Paris, 1724). It may be well to mention here the two <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the ancient Roman Mass-book known as the "Sacramentarium Gregorianum" (Mabillon, Lit. Rom. Vetus, II, 407), said by the Pontiff over the acolyte, and the first of which is identical with that of the actual Roman Pontifical "Domine, sancte Pater, aeterne Deus, qui ad Moysen et Aaron locutus es," etc.

<p>According to the aforementioned "Statuta Ecclesiae Antiqua," which give us the ritual usage of the most important churches in Gaul about the year 500, the candidate for acolyte was first instructed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office, and then a <a href="../cathen/03248a.htm">candlestick</a>, with a <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candle</a> extinguished, was placed in his hand by the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, as a sign that the lights of the church would be in his care; moreover, an empty <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a> was given him, symbolical of his office of presenting wine and water at the altar for the holy sacrifice. A short blessing followed. (See <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">MINOR ORDERS</a>; <a href="../cathen/06165a.htm">FRACTIO PANIS</a>; <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">EUCHARIST</a>; <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">MASS</a>.)
