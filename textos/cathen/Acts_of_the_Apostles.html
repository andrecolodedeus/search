<h1>Acts of the Apostles</h1>  

<p>In the accepted order of the books of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the fifth book is called The <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> (<em>praxeis Apostolon</em>). Some have thought that the title of the book was affixed by the author himself. This is the opinion of <a href="../cathen/04378a.htm">Cornely</a> in his "Introduction to the Books of the New Testament" (second edition, page 315). It seems far more probable, however, that the name was subsequently attached to the book just as the headings of the several Gospels were affixed to them. In fact, the name, <em>Acts of the Apostles</em>, does not precisely convey the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the contents of the book; and such a title would scarcely be given to the work by the author himself.
<h2>Content</h2>

<p>The book does not contain the Acts of all the Apostles, neither does it contain all the acts of any Apostle. It opens with a brief notice of the forty days succeeding the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a> during which He appeared to the Apostles, "speaking the things concerning the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>". The promise of the Holy Ghost and the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension of Christ</a> are then briefly recorded. <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a> advises that a successor be chosen in the place of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, and Matthias is chosen by lot. On Pentecost the Holy Ghost descends on the Apostles, and confers on them the gift of tongues. To the wondering witnesses <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a> explains the great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, proving that it is the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> that is operating. By that great discourse many were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">religion of Christ</a> and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, "and there were added unto them in that day about three thousand <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>". This was the beginning of the Judeo-Christian <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. "And the Lord added to them day by day those that were being saved." Peter and John heal a man, lame from his mother's womb, at the door of the Temple which is called Beautiful. The people are filled with wonder and amazement at the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> and run together unto Peter and John in the portico that was called Solomon's. Peter again preaches <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, asserting that by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the lame man had been made strong. "And many of them that heard the word <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>", and the number of the men came to be about five thousand. But now "the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the prefect of the Temple and the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> came upon them, being sorely troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection from the dead</a>. And they laid hands on them, and put them in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> unto the morrow." On the morrow Peter and John are summoned before rulers, elders, and scribes, among whom were present Annas, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High-Priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>, and as many as were of the kindred of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High-Priest</a>. And when they had set Peter and John in the midst they inquired: "By what power, or in want name have ye done this?" Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, answering gave utterance to one of the most sublime professions of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> ever made by man: "Be it known unto you all, and to all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">people of Israel</a>, that in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ of Nazareth</a>, whom ye crucified, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised from the dead</a>, in this name doth this man stand here before you whole. He [<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>] is the stone which was set at naught by you the builders, which was made the head of the corner [<a href="../bible/isa028.htm#vrs16">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#vrs42">Matthew 21:42</a>]. And in no other is there <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: For neither is there any other name under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved." The members of the council were brought face to face with the most positive evidence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. They command the two Apostles to go aside out of the council, and then they confer among themselves, saying "What shall we do with these men? For that indeed a notable <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; and we cannot deny it". Here is one of the splendid instances of that great <em>cumulus</em> of evidence upon which the certitude of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> rests. A bitterly hostile council of the chief <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to declare that a notable <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> had been wrought, which it cannot deny, and which is manifest to all that dwell in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>With dreadful malice the council attempts to restrain the great movement of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. They threaten the Apostles, and charge them not to speak at all or teach in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; Peter and John contemn the threat, calling upon the council to judge whether it be right to hearken unto the council rather than unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The members of the council could not inflict punishment upon the two Apostles, on account of the people, who glorified <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on account of the great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. Peter and John, being freed from custody, return to the other Apostles. They all give glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for boldness to speak the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the place shakes, and they are filled with the Holy Ghost.

<p>The fervour of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at that epoch was very great. They were of one heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; they had all things in common. As many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and delivered the price to the Apostles, and this money was distributed as anyone had need. But a certain Ananias, with Saphira his wife, sold a possession and kept back part of the price, the wife being accessory to the deed. <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a> is inspired by the Holy Ghost to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the deception, and rebukes Ananias for the lie to the Holy Ghost. At the rebuke the man falls dead. Saphira, coming up afterwards, and knowing nothing of the death of her husband, is interrogated by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a> regarding the transaction. She also keeps back a part of the price, and <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lyingly</a> asserts that the full price has been brought to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a> rebukes her, and she also falls dead at his words. The multitude saw in the death of Ananias and Saphira <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> punishment, and great fear came upon all. This <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also confirmed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those that believed and drew disciples to them. At this stage of the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to attest the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of her teaching, and the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">power of miracles</a> was abundantly bestowed upon the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. These <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are not reviewed in detail in Acts, but it is stated: "And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people" (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#vrs12">Acts 5:12</a>). Multitudes both of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were added to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community. The people of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> carried out the sick and laid them on beds and couches in the streets that the shadow of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a> might fall on them. They brought the sick from the cities round about <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and every one was healed.


<p>The most powerful <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at this epoch were the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>. They were especially opposed to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>. The cardinal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Apostles' teaching was: Life Everlasting through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Who was crucified for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and Who is risen from the dead. The <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High-Priest</a> Annas favored the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, and his son Ananus. who afterwards became <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High-Priest</a>, was a <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducee</a> (Josephus, Antiq., XX, viii). These fierce sectaries made with Annas and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a> common cause against the Apostles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and cast them again into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. The Acts leaves us in no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the motive that inspired the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High-Priest</a> and the sectaries: "They were filled with jealousy". The religious leaders of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> saw their influence with the people waning before the power which worked in the Apostles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of the Lord</a> by night opened the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> doors, and brought the Apostles out, and bade them go and preach in the Temple. The council of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, not finding Peter and John in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and learning of their <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> deliverance, are much perplexed. On information that they are teaching in the Temple, they send and take them, but without <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, fearing the people. It is evident throughout that the common people are disposed to follow the Apostles; the opposition comes from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the classes, most of the latter being <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>. The council accuses the Apostles that, contrary to its former injunction not to teach in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name, they had filled <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching. Peter's defence is that they must obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rather than men. He then boldly reiterates the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Redemption and of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. The council is minded to kill the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. At this point <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, a doctor of the Jewish law, held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of all the people, arises in the council in defence of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. He cites precedents to prove that, if the New Teaching be of men, it will be overthrown; and if it be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it will be impossible to overthrow it. <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel's</a> counsel prevails, and the council calls the Apostles, beats them, and lets them go, charging them not to speak in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. But the Apostles departed, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour for the Name. And every day, in the Temple and privately they ceased not to teach and to preach <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus the Christ</a>.

<p>A murmuring having arisen of the Grecian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that their <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> were neglected in the daily ministration, the Apostles, deeming it unworthy that they should forsake the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and serve tables, appoint seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to minister. Chief among the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> was Stephen, a man full of the Holy Spirit. He wrought great signs and wonders among the people. The anti-Christian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> endeavour to resist him, but are not able to withstand the wisdom and the spirit by which he speaks. They suborn witnesses to testify that he has spoken against Moses and the Temple. Stephen is seized and brought into the council. False witnesses testify that they have heard Stephen say that "this <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a> shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us". All who sat in the council saw Stephen's face, as it had been the face of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. He makes a defence, in which he reviews the chief events in the first covenant, and its relation to the New Law. They rush upon Stephen, drag him out of the city, and stone him to death. And he kneels down and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>: "Lord, lay not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge", and dies. Beginning with the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Stephen, a great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> arose against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; all were scattered abroad throughout <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and Samaria, except the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The leader of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was Saul, afterwards to become the great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Philip first preaches in Samaria with great fruit. Like all the preachers of the first days of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Philip confirms his preaching by great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Peter and John go up to Samaria and confirm the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> whom Philip had made. Philip, commanded by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, goes down the road from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, and on the way <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> and baptizes the eunuch of Candace Queen of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>. Philip is thence transported by Divine power to Azotus and preaches to all the coast cities until be comes to C&aelig;sarea.

<p>Saul, breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, sets out for Damascus to apprehend any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> whom he may find there. As he draws near to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> speaks to him out of the heavens and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> him. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Ananias at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, and straightway for some days abides there, preaching in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. He withdraws into Arabia; again returns to Damascus; and after three years be goes up to Jerusalem. At <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is at first distrusted by the disciples of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; but after Barnabas narrates to them <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> marvellous <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, they receive <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and he preaches boldly in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, disputing especially against the Grecian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. They plot to kill him; but the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> bring <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> down to C&aelig;sarea, and send him forth to <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, his native city.

<p>At this epoch Acts describes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> as "at peace, being builded up, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and by the strength of the Holy Ghost it was multiplied". Peter now goes throughout all parts comforting the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. At Lydda he heals the palsied &AElig;neas; and at Joppa he raises the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> Tabitha (Greek, Dorcas) from the dead. These <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> still more confirm the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. At Joppa Peter has the great vision of the sheet let down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> containing all manner of animals, of which he, being in a trance, is commanded to kill and eat. Peter refuses, on the ground that he cannot eat that which is common and unclean. Whereupon it is made known to him from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has cleansed what was before to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> unclean. This great vision, revealed three times, was the manifestation of the will of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> that the ritual law of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> should cease; and that henceforth <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> should be offered without distinction to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>. The meaning of the vision is unfolded to Peter, when he is commanded by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to go to C&aelig;sarea, to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a>, whose messengers were even then come to fetch him. He goes, and hears from <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> also the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion's</a> own vision. He preaches to him and to all assembled; the Holy Ghost descends upon them, and Peter commands that they be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Returning to Jerusalem, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> contend with Peter that he has gone in to men uncircumcised, and eaten with them. He expounds to them his vision at Joppa, and also the vision of <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a>, wherein the latter was commanded by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to send and fetch Peter from Joppa, that he might receive from Peter the Gospel. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> acquiesce, glorifying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and declaring that "unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also hath <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> granted repentance unto life". Those who had been scattered abroad from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at the time of Stephen's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> had travailed as far as <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and Antioch preaching <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; but they preached to none save the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> was not yet understood by them. But now some <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> from <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and Cyrene come up to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and preach the Gospel to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. A great number believe, and turn to the Lord. The report of the work at Antioch comes to the ears of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; and they send Barnabas, "a good man full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>", to them. He takes <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> from <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, and they both dwell at Antioch a whole year, and teach many people. The disciples of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> first at Antioch.

<p>The rest of Acts narrates the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Herod Agrippa</a>; the mission of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Barnabas from Antioch by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, to preach to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> nations; the labours of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Barnabas in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, their return to Antioch; the dissension at Antioch concerning <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; the journey of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Barnabas to Jerusalem, the decision of the Apostolic Council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the separation of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> from Barnabas, in whose stead he takes Silas, or Silvanus; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> visit to his <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> Churches, his foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/12007c.htm">Philippi</a>; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> sufferings for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> visit to Athens, his foundation of the churches of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> and of Ephesus; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> return to Jerusalem, his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> at C&aelig;sarea; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> appeal to C&aelig;sar, his voyage to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the shipwreck; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> arrival at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the manner of his life there. We see therefore that a more proper title of this book would be "The Beginnings of the Christian Religion". It is an artistic whole, the fullest history which we possess of the manner in which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> developed.
<h2>The origin of the Church</h2>

<p>In Acts we see the fulfilment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promises. In <a href="../bible/act001.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had declared that the Apostles should receive power when the Holy Ghost should come upon them, and should be His witnesses both in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and in all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. In <a href="../bible/joh014.htm">John 14:12</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had declared: "He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> in me, the works that I do, he also shall do, and greater works than these shall he do. Because I go to the Father". In these passages is found the key-note of the origin of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> developed according to the plan conceived by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. There is, assuredly, in the narration evidence of the working out of a great plan; for the reason that the writer records the working out of the great design of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, conceived in <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> wisdom, and executed by <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> power. There is throughout a well-defined, systematic order of narration, an exactness and fullness of detail. After the calling of the first twelve Apostles, there is no event in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> so important as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> and commission to teach in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name. Up to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, the inspired historian of the Acts has given us a condensed statement of the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Peter and John are prominent in the work. But the great message is now to issue forth from the confines of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>; all flesh is to see the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is to be the great instrument in preaching <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. In the development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wrought more than all the other Apostles; and therefore in Acts <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> stands forth, the prominent agent of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the world. His appointment as the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> does not prevent him from preaching to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but his richest fruits are gathered from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. He fills proconsular <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the Gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and the greater part of Acts is devoted exclusively to recording his work.
<h2>Division of book</h2>

<p>In the Acts there are no divisions of the narration contemplated by the author. It is open to us to divide the work as we deem fit. The nature of the history therein recorded easily suggests a greater division of Acts into two parts: <ul> <li>The beginning and propagation of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (1-9); <li>The beginning and propagation of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> (10-28). <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a> plays the chief role in the first part; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, in the second part. </ul>
<h2>Object</h2>

<p>The <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> must not be believed to be an isolated writing, but rather an integral part in a well-ordered series. Acts presupposes its readers to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Gospels; it continues the Gospel narrative. The Four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> close with the account of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. St. Mark is the only one who essays to give any of the subsequent history, and he condenses his account into one brief sentence: "And they went forth and preached everywhere: the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed" (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs20">Mark 16:20</a>). Now the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> takes up the narrative here and records succinctly the mighty events which were wrought by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> through chosen human agents. It is a condensed record of the fulfilment of the promises of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> record <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promises which He made to the disciples, regarding the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its mission (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs15">Matthew 16:15-20</a>); the gift of the Holy Ghost (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs49">Luke 24:49</a>; <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs16">John 14:16, 17</a>); the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">gentiles</a> (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs18">Matthew 28:18-20</a>; <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs46">Luke 24:46, 47</a>). Acts records the fulfilment. The history begins at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and ends at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. With divine simplicity Acts shows us the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">religion of Christ</a> among the nations. The distinction between <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> is abolished by the revelation to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a>; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is called to devote himself specially to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> ministry, the Holy Ghost works signs in confirmation of the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; men suffer and die, but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> grows; and thus the whole world sees the Salvation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nowhere in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> is the action of the Holy Ghost in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> so forcibly set forth as in the Acts. He fills the Apostles with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and power on Pentecost; they speak as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak; the Holy Ghost bids Philip the deacon go to the eunuch of Candace; the same Spirit catches up Philip, after the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the eunuch, and brings him to Azotus; the Holy Ghost tells Peter to go to <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a>; when Peter preaches to <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> the Holy Ghost falls on them all; the Holy Ghost directly commands that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Barnabas be set apart for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> ministry; the Holy Ghost forbids <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Silas to preach in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>; constantly, by the laying on of the Apostles' hands, the Holy Ghost comes upon the faithful; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is directed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in everything; the Holy Ghost foretells to him that bonds and afflictions await him in every city; when <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a> prophesies <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, he says: "Thus saith the Holy Ghost: 'So shall the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles'</a>". Acts declares that on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> the grace of the Holy Ghost is poured out; in the splendid description of <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">St. Stephen's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> he is declared full of the Holy Ghost; when Peter makes his defense before rulers, elders, and scribes, he is filled with the Holy Ghost; often it is declared that the Apostles are filled with the Holy Ghost; Philip is chosen as a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> because be is full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the Holy Ghost; when Ananias is sent to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> at <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> he declares that he is sent that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> may receive his sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is declared to be anointed with the Holy Ghost; Barnabas is declared to be full of the Holy Ghost; the men of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands of Peter and John. This history shows the real nature of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>; its members are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Holy Ghost, and are upheld by His power. The source in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible truth in teaching</a>, of grace, and of the power that resists the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a> is the Holy Ghost. By the power of the Spirit the Apostles established the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the great centres of the world: <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, Antioch <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm#II">Antioch of Pisidia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a>, <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a>, <a href="../cathen/12007c.htm">Philippi</a>, <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, Ber&aelig;a, <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, Ephesus, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. From these centres the message went to the surrounding lands. We see in the Acts the realization of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promises just before his <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>: "But ye shall receive power when the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be my witnesses both in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and in all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth". In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> Acts forms a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connecting-link between the Gospels and the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. It gives the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> information concerning the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and his apostolate, and also concerning the formation of the great Churches to which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> wrote his Epistles.
<h2>Authenticity</h2>

<p>The authenticity of the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> be intrinsic evidence; it is attested by the concordant voice of tradition. The unity of style of Acts and its artistic completeness compel us to receive the book as the work of one author. Such an effect could never arise from the piecing together bits of writings of different authors. The writer writes as an eyewitness and compaction of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. The passages <a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs10">Acts 16:10-17</a>; <a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs5">20:5-15</a>; <a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs1">21:1-18</a>; <a href="../bible/act027.htm#vrs1">27:1</a>; <a href="../bible/act028.htm#vrs16">28:16</a> are called the <em>We</em> passages. In these the writer uniformly employs the first <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> plural, closely identifying himself with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. This excludes the theory that Acts is the work of a redactor. As Renan has well said, such use of the pronoun is incompatible with any theory of redaction. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that Luke was the companion and fellow-labourer of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Writing to the Colossians, in his salutation <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> associates with himself, "Luke, the beloved physician" (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs14">4:14</a>). In <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs11">2 Timothy 4:11</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declares: "Only Luke is with me". To Philemon (<a href="../bible/phm001.htm#vrs24">24</a>) <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> calls Luke his fellow-worker. Now in this article, we may suppose the Lucan authorship of the third Gospel as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. The writer of Acts in his opening sentence implicitly declares himself to be the author of the third Gospel. He addresses his work to Theophilus, the addressee of the third Gospel; he mentions his former work and in substance makes known his intention of continuing the history which, in his former treatise, he had brought up to the day when the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> was received up. There is an identity of style between Acts and the third Gospel. An examination of the original Greek texts of the third Gospel and of the Acts reveals that there is in them a remarkable identity of manner of thinking and of writing. There is in both the same tender regard for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the same respect for the Roman Empire, the same treatment of the Jewish rites, the same broad conception that the Gospel is for all men. In forms of expression the third Gospel and the Acts reveal an identity of authorship. Many of the expressions usual in both works occur but rarely in the rest of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; other expressions are found nowhere else save in the third Gospel and in the Acts. If one will compare the following expressions in the Greek, he will be persuaded that both works are of the same author: <ul> <li><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs1">Luke 1:1</a>-<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs24">Acts 15:24-25</a>; <li><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#vrs13">Luke 15:13</a>-<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs5">Acts 1:5</a>, <a href="../bible/act027.htm#vrs14">27:14</a>, <a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs11">19:11</a>; <li><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs20">Luke 1:20, 80</a>-<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs2">Acts 1:2, 22</a>; <a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs29">2:29</a>; <a href="../bible/act007.htm#vrs45">7:45</a>; <li><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs34">Luke 4:34</a>-<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs27">Acts 2:27</a>; <a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs27">4:27, 30</a>; <li><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs5">Luke 23:5</a>-<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs37">Acts 10:37</a>; <li><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs9">Luke 1:9</a>-<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs17">Acts 1:17</a>; <li><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#vrs56">Luke 12:56</a>, <a href="../bible/luk021.htm#vrs35">21:35</a>-<a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs26">Acts 17:26</a>.</ul> The last-cited parallel expression, <em>to prosopon tes ges</em>, is employed only in the third Gospel and in Acts. The evidence of the Lucan authorship of Acts is cumulative. The intrinsic evidence is corroborated by the testimonies of many witnesses. It must be granted that in the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> we find but faint allusions to the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>. The Fathers of that age wrote but little; and the injury of time has robbed us of much of what was written. The Gospels were more prominent in the teachings of that day and they consequently have a more abundant witness. The canon of Muratori contains the canon of Scriptures of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the second century. Of Acts it declares: "But the Acts of all the Apostles are written in one book, which for the excellent Theophilus Luke wrote, because he was an eyewitness of all". In <a href="../cathen/05088a.htm">"The Doctrine of Addai"</a>, which contains the ancient tradition of the <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Church of Edessa</a>, the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> are declared to be a part of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> (Doctrine of Addai, ed. Phillips, 1876, 46). The twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth chapters of St. Iren&aelig;us's third book "Against Heresies" are based upon the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>. Iren&aelig;us convincingly defends the Lucan authorship of the third Gospel and Acts, declaring: "But that this Luke was inseparable from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and was his fellow-labourer in the Gospel, he himself clearly evinces, not as a matter of boasting, but as bound to do so, by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself. . . And all the remaining facts of his courses with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, he recounts. . . As Luke was present at all these occurrences, he carefully noted them down in writing, so that he cannot be convicted of falsehood or boastfulness, etc." Iren&aelig;us unites in himself the witness of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> of the East and the West of the second century. He continues unchanged the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a>. In his treatise "On Fasting" <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> accepts Acts as <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, and calls them the "Commentary of Luke". In his treatise <a href="../fathers/0311.htm"><em>On Prescription against Heretics</em> 22</a>, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> is strong in asserting the canonicity of Acts: "And assuredly, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fulfilled his promise, since it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> that the Holy Ghost did come down. Now they who reject that Scripture can neither belong to the Holy Ghost, seeing that they cannot acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has been sent as yet to the disciples, nor can they presume to be a church themselves, who positively have no means of proving when, and with what infant-nursings this body was established." Again, in chapter xxiii of the same treatise, he issues a challenge to those who reject Acts: "I may say here to those who reject the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>: It is first <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that you show us who this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was; both what he was before he became an Apostle, and how he became an Apostle" etc. <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> is a clear witness. In <a href="../fathers/02105.htm"><em>Stromata</em> V.11</a>, he declares: "Most instructively, therefore, says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>: 'The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that made the world, and all things in it, being the Lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and of earth, dwelleth not in <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> made with hands'" etc. (<a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs24">Acts 17:24, 25</a>). Again, in <a href="../bible/act012.htm">chapter 12</a>, he states: "As Luke, in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, relates that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: 'Men of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, I perceive that in all things, ye are greatly <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious'</a>". In Hom., xiii, on Genesis, ii, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> asserts the Lucan authorship of Acts as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that all the world accepted. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.25</a>) places Acts among <em>ta homologoumena,</em> the books of which no one has <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. The authenticity of Acts is so well <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that even the sceptical Renan was forced to declare: "A thing beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is that the Acts have the same author as the third Gospel, and are a continuation of the same. One finds no necessity to prove this fact, which has never seriously been denied. The prefaces of the two writings, the dedication of both the one and the other to Theophilus, the perfect resemblance of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and manner of expression furnish a convincing demonstration of the fact" (Les Ap&ocirc;tres, Introd., p. x). Again he says: "The third Gospel and the Acts form a well-ordered work, written with reflection and even with art, written by the same hand, and with a definite plan. The two works taken together form a whole, having the same style, presenting the same characteristic expressions, and citing the Scripture in the same manner" (ibid., p. xi).
<h2>Objections against the authenticity</h2>

<p>Nevertheless this well-proved <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been contradicted. Baur, Schwanbeck, De Wette, Davidson, Mayerhoff, Schleiermacher, Bleek, Krenkel, and others have opposed the authenticity of the Acts. An objection is drawn from the discrepancy between <a href="../bible/act009.htm">Acts 9:19-28</a> and <a href="../bible/gal001.htm">Galatians 1:17-19</a>. In <a href="../bible/gal001.htm">Galatians 1:17-18</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> declares that, immediately after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, he went away into Arabia, and again returned to Damascus. "Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas." In Acts no mention is made of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> journey into Arabia; and the journey to Jerusalem is placed immediately after the notice of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> preaching in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>. Hilgenfeld, Wendt, Weiz&auml;cker, Weiss, and others allege here a contradiction between the writer of the Acts and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Their charge is vain: There is here verified what is the usual fact when two inspired writers narrate synchronistic events. No writer of either Testament had in mind to write a complete history. Out of the great mass of words and deeds they grouped together those things which they deemed best for their scope. They always concur on the great lines of the doctrines and the main facts; they differ in that one omits certain things which another relates. The writers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> wrote with the conviction that the world had already received the message by oral communication. Not all could have a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the written word, but all heard the voice of those who preached <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The intense activity of the first teachers of the New Law made it a living reality in every land. The few writings which were produced were considered as supplementary to the greater economy of preaching. Hence we find notable omissions in all the writers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; and every writer has some things proper to himself. In the present instance the writer of Acts has omitted <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> journey into Arabia and sojourn there. The evidence of the omission is in the text itself. In <a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs19">Acts 9:19</a>, the writer speaks of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> sojourn in Damascus as covering a period of "certain days". This is the indefinite description of a relatively short space of time. In <a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs23">Acts 9:23</a>, he connects the next event narrated with the foregoing by declaring that it came to pass "after many days were fulfilled". It is evident that some series of events must have had place between the "certain days" of the nineteenth verse, and the "many days" of the twenty-third verse; these events are <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> journey into Arabia, his sojourn there, and his return to Damascus. Another objection is urged from <a href="../bible/1th003.htm#vrs1">1 Thessalonians 3:1-2</a>, compared with <a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs14">Acts 17:14-15</a> and <a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs5">18:5</a>. In <a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs14">Acts 17:14-15</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> leaves Timothy and Silas at Ber&aelig;a, with a commandment to come to him at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. In <a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs5">Acts 18:5</a>, Timothy and Silas come out of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. But in <a href="../bible/1th003.htm#vrs1">1 Thessalonians 3:1-2</a>, Timothy is sent by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> out of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> to <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, and no mention is made of Silas. We must appeal to the principle that when a writer omits one or more members in a series of events he does not thereby contradict another writer who may narrate the thing omitted. Timothy and Silas came down from Ber&aelig;a to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. In his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the Macedonian churches, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> sent Timothy back from <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> to <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, and Silas to some other part of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>. When they return out of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> they come to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. Acts has omitted their coming to Athens and their return to <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>. In Acts many things are condensed into a narrow compass. Thus, to the Galatian ministry of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, which must have lasted a considerable time, Acts devotes the one sentence: "They passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia" (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs6">Acts 16:6</a>). The fourth journey of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to Jerusalem in described in one verse (<a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs22">Acts 18:22</a>). The objection is urged that, from <a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs12">Acts 16:12</a>, it is evident that the author of the Acts was with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/12007c.htm">Philippi</a>. Therefore, they say that, since Luke was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when he wrote thence to the Philippians, had Luke been the author of Acts, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> would have associated Luke with himself in his salutation to the Philippians in the letter which he wrote them. On the contrary, we find in it no mention of Luke; but Timothy is associated with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the salutation. This is a mere negative argument, and of no avail. The apostolic men of that day neither sought nor gave vain personal recognition in their work. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> wrote to the Romans without ever mentioning <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a>. There was no struggle for place or fame among those men. It may hare been that, though Luke was with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> at <a href="../cathen/12007c.htm">Philippi</a>, Timothy was the better known to that Church. Again, at the moment of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> writing Luke may have been absent from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> allege that there is an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the discourse of <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a> (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#vrs36">Acts 5:36</a>). <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a> refers to the insurrection of Theodas as a thing that had happened before the days of the Apostles, whereas <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Antiq., XX, v, 1) places the rebellion of Theodas under Fadus, fourteen years after the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the speech of <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a>. Here, as elsewhere, the adversaries of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> presuppose every writer who disagrees with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> to be right. Every one who has examined <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> must be struck by his carelessness and inaccuracy. He wrote mainly from memory, and often contradicts himself. In the present instance some suppose that he has confused the insurrection of Theodas with that of a certain Mathias, of whom he speaks in Antiq., XVII, vi, 4. <em>Theodas</em> is a contraction of <em>Theodoros,</em> and is identical in signification with the Hebrew name <em>Mathias,</em> both names signifying, "Gift of God". This is the opinion of Corluy in Vigouroux, "Dictionnaire de la Bible". Against Corluy's opinion it may rightly be objected that <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a> clearly intimates that the author of the insurrection of which he speaks was not actuated by holy motives. He speaks of him as a seditious man, who misled his followers, "giving himself out to be somebody". But <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> describes Mathias as a most eloquent interpreter of the Jewish law, a man beloved by the people, whose lectures those who were studious of virtue frequented. Moreover, he incited the young men to pull down the golden eagle which the impious <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> had erected in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple of God</a>. Certainly such an act was pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not the act of an impostor. The argument of <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a> is based on the fact that Theodas claimed to be something which he was not. The character of Theodas as given by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, XX, v, 1, accords with the implied character of the Theodas of Acts. Were it not for the discrepancy of dates, the two testimonies would be in perfect accord. It seems far more probable, therefore, that both writers speak of the same man, and that <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> has <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> placed his epoch about thirty years too late. Of course it is possible that there may have been two Theodases of similar character: one of the days of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the Great, whom <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> does not name, but who is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a>; and one in the days of Cuspius Fadus the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, whose insurrection <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> records. There must have been many of such character in the days of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the Great</a>, for <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, speaking of that epoch, declares that "at this time there were ten thousand other disorders in Jud&aelig;a which were like tumults" (Antiq., XVII, x, 4).

<p>It is urged that the three accounts of the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs7">Acts 9:7</a>; <a href="../bible/act022.htm#vrs9">22:9</a>; <a href="../bible/act026.htm#vrs14">26:14</a>) do not agree. In <a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs7">Acts 9:7</a>, the author declares that "the men that journeyed with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <em>stood</em> speechless, hearing the voice, but beholding no man". In <a href="../bible/act022.htm#vrs9">Acts 22:9</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declares: "And they that were with me beheld indeed the light; but they heard not the voice of Him that spake to me". In <a href="../bible/act026.htm#vrs14">26:14</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declares that they all fell to the earth, which seems to contradict the first statement, that they "stood speechless". This is purely a question of circumstantial detail, of very minor moment. There are many solutions of this difficulty. Supported by many precedents, we may hold that in the several narrations of the same event inspiration does not compel an absolute agreement in mere extrinsic details which in nowise affects the substance of the narration. In all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, where the same event is several times narrated by the same writer, or narrated by several writers, there is some slight divergency, as it is natural there should be with those who spoke and wrote from memory. <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Divine inspiration</a> covers the substance of the narration. For those who insist that divine inspiration extends also to these minor details there are valid solutions. Pape and others give to the <em>eistekeisan</em> the sense of an emphatic <em>einai</em>, and thus it could be rendered: "The men that journeyed with him became speechless", thus agreeing with <a href="../bible/act026.htm#vrs14">26:14</a>. Moreover, the three accounts can be placed in agreement by supposing that the several accounts contemplate the event at different moments of its course. All saw a great light; all heard a sound from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. They fell on their faces in fear; and then, arising, stood still and speechless, while <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> conversed with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whose articulate voice he alone heard. In <a href="../bible/act009.htm">Acts 9:7</a>, the marginal reading of the Revised Edition of Oxford should be accepted: "hearing the sound". The Greek is <em>akoyontes tes phones</em>. When the writer speaks of the articulate voice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> alone heard, he employs the phrase outer phrase, <em>ekousan phonen</em>. Thus the same term, <em>phone</em>, by a different grammatical construction, may signify the inarticulate sound of the voice which all heard and the articulate voice which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> alone heard.

<p>It is urged that <a href="../bible/act016.htm">Acts 16:6</a> and <a href="../bible/act018.htm">18:23</a> represent <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> as merely passing through Galatia, whereas the Epistle to the Galatians gives evidence of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> longer sojourn in Galatia. <a href="../cathen/04378a.htm">Cornely</a> and others answer this difficulty by supposing that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> employs the term <em>Galatia</em> in the administrative sense, as a province, which comprised Galatia proper, Lycaonia, <a href="../cathen/12116b.htm">Pisidia</a>, Isauria, and a great part of Phrygia; whereas St. Luke employs the term to denote Galatia proper. But we are not limited to this explanation; St. Luke in Acts often severely condenses his narrative. He devotes but one verse (xviii, 22) to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> fourth journey to Jerusalem; he condenses his narrative of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> two years of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> at C&aelig;sarea into a few lines. Thus he may also have judged good for his scope to pass over in one sentence <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> Galatian ministry.
<h2>Date of composition</h2>

<p>As regards the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the Book of Acts, we may at most assign a probable date for the completion of the book. It is recognized by all that Acts ends abruptly. The author devotes but two verses to the two years which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> spent at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. These two years were in a certain sense uneventful. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> dwelt peaceably at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and preached the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> to all who went in unto him. It seems probable that during this peaceful epoch St. Luke composed the Book of Acts and terminated it abruptly at the end of the two years, as some unrecorded vicissitude carried him out into other events. The date of the completion of Acts is therefore dependent on the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> Roman captivity. Writers are quite concordant in placing the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> coming to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the year 62; hence the year 64 is the most probable date for the Acts.
<h2>Texts of the Acts</h2>

<p>In the Gr&aelig;co-Latin <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> D and E of Acts, we find a text widely differing from that of the other <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>, and from the received text. By Sanday and Headlam (Romans, p. xxi) this is called the <em>delta</em> text; by Blass (Acta Apostolorum, p. 24) it is called the <em>beta</em> text. The famous Latin Codex now at <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a>, from its size called the <em>Codex Gigas,</em> also in the main represents this text. Dr. Bornemann (Acta Apost.) endeavoured to prove that the aforesaid text was Luke's original, but his theory has not been received. Dr. Blass (Acta Apost., p. vii) endeavours to prove that Luke wrote first a rough draft of Acts, and that this is preserved in D and E. Luke revised this rough draft, and sent it to Theophilus; and this revised copy he supposes to be the original of our received text. Belser, Nestle, Zoeckler, and others have adopted his theory. The theory is, however, rejected by the greater number. It seems far more probable that D and E contain a recension, wherein the copyists have added, paraphrased, and changed things in the text, according to that tendency which prevailed up to the second half of the second century of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era.
<h2>The Biblical Commission</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02557a.htm">Biblical Commission</a>, 12 June, 1913, published the following answers to various questions about the Acts: The author of the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> is Luke the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>, as is clear from Tradition, internal evidence in the Acts themselves and in their relation to the third Gospel (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs1">Luke 1:1-4</a>; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs1">Acts 1:1-2</a>). The unity of their authorship can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> critically by their language, style and plan of narrative, and by their unity of scope and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The occasional substitution of the first <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> plural for the third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> so far from impairing, only establishes more strongly their unity of composition and authenticity. The relations of Luke with the chief founders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Palestine, and with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; his industry and diligence as an eyewitness and in examining witnesses; the remarkable agreement of the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> with the Epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and with the more genuine historical records, all go to show that Luke had at his command most trustworthy sources, and that he used them in such a manner as to make his work historically authoritative. This authority is not diminished by the difficulties alleged against the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> facts he records, by his manner of condensing statements, by apparent disagreements with profane or Biblical history, or by apparent inconsistencies with his own or with other scriptural writings.
