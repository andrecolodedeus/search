<h1>Acts of the Martyrs</h1>  

<p>In a strict sense the Acts of the Martyrs are the official records of the trials of early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> made by the notaries of the court. In a wider sense, however, the title is applied to all the narratives of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> trial and death. In the latter sense, they may be classified as follows: <ul><li> Official reports of the interrogatories (<em>acta</em>, <em>gesta</em>). Those extant, like the "Acta Proconsulis" (Cyprian, "Ep. lxxvii ") are few in number and have only come down to us in editions prepared with a view to the edification of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The "Passio Cypriani" and "Acta Martyrum Scillitanorum" are typical of this class. Of these the former is a composite work of three separate documents showing the minimum of editorial additions in a few connecting phrases. The first document gives an account of the trial of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> in 257, the second, his arrest and trial in 258, the third, of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. <li> Non-official records made by eye-witnesses or at least by contemporaries recording the testimony of eye-witnesses. Such are the "Martyrium S. Polycarpi", admitting though it does much that may be due to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> fancy of the eye-witnesses. The "Acta SS. Perpetu&aelig; et Felicitatis" is perhaps of all extant Acta the most beautiful and famous, for it includes the autograph notes of Perpetua and Saturus and an eye-witness's account of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. And to these must be added the "Epistola Ecclesiarum Viennensis et Lugdunensis", telling the story of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and other Acta not so famous. <li> Documents of a later date than the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> based on Acta of the first or second class, and therefore subjected to editorial manipulation of various kinds. It is this class which affords the critic the greatest scope for his discernment. What distinguishes these Acta from the subsequent classes is their literary basis. The editor was not constructing a story to suit oral tradition or to explain a monument. He was editing a literary document according to his own taste and purpose. The class is numerous and its contents highly debatable, for though additional study may raise any particular Acta to a higher class, it is far more likely as a rule to reduce it.</ul>

<p>Besides these three classes of more or less reliable documents, many others pass under the name of Acta Martyrum, though their historicity is of little or no value. They are romances, either written around a few real facts which have been preserved in popular or literary tradition, or else pure works of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, containing no real facts whatever. Among the historical romances we may instance the story of Felicitas and her seven sons, which in its present form seems to be a variation of IV Maccabees, viii, 1, though there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of the underlying facts, one of which has actually been confirmed by <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi's</a> discovery of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Januarius, the eldest son in the narrative. And according to such strict critics as M. Dufourcq (Etude sur les Gesta martyrum romains, Paris, 1900) and P. Delehaye (Analecta Bollandiana, XVI, 235-248), the Roman "Legendarium" can claim no higher class than this; so that, apart from monumental, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, and topographical traditions, much of the literary evidence for the great <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is embedded in historical romances. It may be a matter for surprise that there should be such a class of Acta as the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginative</a> romances, which have no facts at all for their foundation. But they were the novels of those days which unfortunately came to be taken as history. Perhaps such is the case with the story of Genesius the Comedian who was suddenly converted while mimicking the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Christian mysteries</a> (Von der Lage, "Studien z. Genesius Legende", <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1898-9), and the Acts of Didymus and Theodora, the latter of whom was saved by the former, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> soldier, from a punishment worse than death. And even less reputable than these so-called Acta are the story of Barlaam and Josaphat which is the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> adaptation of the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddha</a> legend, the Faust-legend of <a href="../cathen/04583a.htm">Cyprian of Antioch</a>, and the romance of the heroine who, under the various names of Pelagia, Marina, Eugenia, Margaret, or Apollinaria is admitted in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> dress to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, convicted of misconduct, and posthumously rehabilitated. St. Liberata also, the <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">bearded</a> lady who was nailed to a cross, is a saint of fiction only, though the romance was probably invented with the definite purpose of explaining the draped figure of a crucifix.

<p>Still these two classes of romantic Acta can hardly be regarded as forgeries in the strict sense of that term. They are literary figments, but as they were written with the intention of edifying and not deceiving the reader, a special class must be reserved for hagiographical forgeries. To this must be relegated all those Acts, Passions, Lives, Legends, and Translations which have been written with the express purpose of perverting history, such, for instance, as the legends and translations falsely attaching a saint's name to some special church or city. Their authors disgraced the name of hagiographer, and they would not merit mention were it not that conscious deceit has in consequence been attributed to those hagiographers, who, having for their object to edify and not to instruct, have written Acta which were meant to be read as romances and not as history.

<p>Besides these detached Acta Martyrum, there are other literary documents concerning the life and death of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> which may be mentioned here. The Calendaria were lists of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> celebrated by the different Churches according to their different dates. The Martyrologies represent collections of different Calendaria and sometimes add details of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. The Itineraries are guide-books drawn up for the use of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to the sanctuaries of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; they are not without their utility in so far as they reveal, not only the resting places of the great dead, but also the traditions which were current in the seventh century. The writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> also embody many references to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, as, for instance, the sermons of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, Augustine, Peter Chrysologus, and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">John Damascene</a>.

<p>Finally there are to be considered the collections of Lives, intended for public and private reading. Most important of all are the "Historia Ecclesiastica" of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (265-340), and his "De Martyribus Palestin&aelig;"; but unfortunately his <em>martyron synagoge</em> or Collection of Acts of the Martyrs, to which he refers in the preface of the fifth book of his "Historia Ecclesiastica", is no longer extant. The fourteen poems of Aurelius Prudentius Clemens, published in 404 as the "Persitephanon liber", celebrated the praises of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; but as the author allowed himself the license of the poet with his material, he is not always reliable. The writers of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> are responsible for a very large element of the fictitious in the stories of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; they did not even make a proper use of the material they had at their disposal. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> was the first of these <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> hagiographers with his "De virtutibus S. Martini", "De gloria Confessorum", and "De vitis Sanctorum". <a href="../cathen/10225a.htm">Simeon Metaphrastes</a> is even less reliable; it has even been questioned whether he was not consciously deceitful. See, however, the article on METAPHRASTES. But the most famous collection of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was the "Golden Legend" of Jacopo de Soragine, first printed in 1476. All these <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers include <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in their collections. So do Mombritius (Milan, 1476), Lipomanus (Venice, 1551), and <a href="../cathen/14343c.htm">Surius</a> (Cologne, 1570). <a href="../cathen/09114b.htm">J. Faber Stapulensis</a> included only Martyrs in his "Martyrum agones antiquis ex monumentis genuine descriptos" (1525), and they are only the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> whose feasts are celebrated in the month of January. But an epoch was marked in the history of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> by the "Acta primorum martyrum sincera et selecta" of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Theodore Ruinart (Paris, 1689) and frequently reprinted (Ratisbon, 1858). Other collections of Acta, subsequent to Ruinart's are Ilbachius, "Acta Martyrum Vindicata" (Rome, 1723). S. Assemai, "Acta SS. Martyrum orient. et occ." (Rome, 1748). T. Mamachii "Origines et Antiquitates Christian&aelig;" (Rome, 1749). The critical study of the Acta Martyrum has been vigorously prosecuted within the last few years, and the standpoint of the critics considerably changed since the attempt of Ruinart to make his selection of Acta. Many of his Acta Sincera will no longer rank as <em>sincera</em>; and if they be arranged in different classes according to their historicity very few can claim a place in our first or second class. But on the other hand the discovery of texts and the arch&aelig;ological researches of <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> and others have confirmed individual stories of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. And a general result of criticism has been to substantiate such main facts as the causes of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the number and heroism of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the popularity of their cultus, and the historicity of the popular heroes.

<p>The chief problem, therefore, for modern critics is to discover the literary history of the Acta which have come down to us. It cannot be denied that some attempt was made at the very first to keep the history of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> inviolate. The public reading of the Acta in the churches would naturally afford a guarantee of their authenticity; and this custom certainly obtained in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, for the Third <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (c. 47) permitted the reading of the "Passiones Martyrum cum anniversarii dies eorum celebrentur". There was also an interchange of Acta between different Churches as we see from the "Martyrium S. Polycarpi" and the "Epistola Ecclesi&aelig; Viennensis et Lugdunensis". But it is not known to what extent those customs were practised. And during the persecutions of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> there must have been a wholesale destruction of documents, with the result that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would lose the accounts of its Martyr's history. This seems to be especially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which possesses so few authentic Acta in spite of the number and fame of its <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; for the Romans had apparently lost the thread of these traditions as early as the second half of the fourth century. The poems of Prudentius, the Calendaria, and even the writings of Pope Damasus show that the story of the persecutions had fallen into obscurity. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> beneath her feet, and celebrated their memory with intense devotion, and yet she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> but little of their history.

<p>Under these circumstances it is not improbable that the desire of the faithful for fuller information would easily be satisfied by raconteurs who, having only scanty material at their disposal, would amplify and multiply the few facts preserved in tradition and attach what they considered suitable stories to historical names and localities. And in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> it is argued these legends were committed to writing, and have come down to us as the Roman <em>legendarium</em>. In support of this severe criticism it is urged that the Roman Acta are for the most part not earlier than the sixth century (Dufourcq), and that spurious Acta were certainly not unknown during the period. The Roman Council of 494 actually condemned the public reading of the Acta (P.L., LIX, 171-2). And this Roman protest had been already anticipated by the Sixth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (401) which protested against the cult of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> whose <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was not certain (canon 17). St. Augustine (354-340) also had written: "Though for other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> we can hardly find accounts which we can read on their festivals, the Passion of St. Stephen is in a canonical book" (Sermo, 315, P.L., XXXVIII, 1426). Subsequently in 692 the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan Council</a> at Constantinople <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> those who were responsible for the reading of spurious Acta. The supposition, therefore, of such an origin for the Roman legends is not improbable. And unfortunately the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are not the only ones whose Acta are unreliable. Of the seventy-four separate Passions included by Ruinart in his Acta Sincera, the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> Delehaye places only thirteen in the first or second class, as original documents. Further study of particular Acta may, of course, raise this number; and other original Acta may be discovered. The labours of such critics as Gebhardt, Aub&eacute;, Franchi de Cavalieri, Le Blant, Conybeare, Harnack, the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, and many others, have in fact, not infrequently issued in this direction, while at the same time they have gathered an extensive bibliography around the several Acta. These must therefore be valued on their respective merits. It may, however, be noticed here that the <a href="../cathen/04491c.htm">higher criticism</a> is as dangerous when applied to the Acts of the Martyrs as it is for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. Arguments may of course, be drawn from the formal setting of the document, its accuracy in dates, names, and topography, and still stronger arguments from what may be called the informal setting given to it unconsciously by its author. But in the first case the formal setting can surely be imitated, and it is unsafe therefore to seek to establish historicity by such an argument. It is equally unsafe to presume that the probability of a narrative, or its simplicity is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that it is genuine. Even the improbable may contain more facts of history than many a narrative which bears the appearance of sobriety and restraint. Nor is conciseness a sure <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that a document is of an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; St. Mark's Gospel is not thus proved to be the earliest of the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a>. The informal setting is more reliable; philology and <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> are better tests than dates and geography, for it needs a clever romancer indeed to identify himself so fully with his heroes as to share their thoughts and emotions. And yet even with this concession to <a href="../cathen/04491c.htm">higher criticism</a>, it still remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the critic is on safer ground when he has succeeded in establishing the pedigree of his document by external evidence.
