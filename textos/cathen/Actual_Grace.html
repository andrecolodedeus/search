<h1>Actual Grace</h1>  

<p>Grace (<em>gratia, Charis</em>), in general, is a supernatural <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a> to intellectual creatures (men, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>) for their eternal salvation, whether the latter be furthered and attained through salutary acts or a state of holiness.

<p>Before the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the Schoolmen seldom distinguished <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> from sanctifying grace. But, in consequence of modern <a href="../cathen/06710a.htm">controversies regarding grace</a>, it has become usual and necessary in theology to draw a sharper distinction between the transient help to act (<a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>) and the permanent state of grace (sanctifying grace). For this reason we adopt this distinction as our principle of division in our exposition of the Catholic doctrine. In this article we shall treat only of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>. (See also <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">SANCTIFYING GRACE</a>.)

<p>Actual grace derives its name, <em>actual</em>, from the Latin <em>actualis</em> (<em>ad actum</em>), for it is granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the performance of salutary acts and is present and disappears with the action itself. Its opposite, therefore, is not <em>possible</em> grace, which is without usefulness or importance, but <em>habitual</em> grace, which causes a state of holiness, so that the mutual relations between these two kinds of grace are the relation between <em>action</em> and <em>state</em>, not those between <em>actuality</em> and <em>potentiality</em>. Later, we shall discuss habitual grace more fully under the name of sanctifying or justifying grace. As to <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, we have to examine: (1) its Nature; (2) its Properties. The third, and difficult, question of the relationship between grace and liberty shall be reserved for discussion in the article <a href="../cathen/06710a.htm">CONTROVERSIES ON GRACE</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Nature of actual grace</h2>

<p>To know the nature of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, we must consider both the comprehension and the extension of the term. Its comprehension is exhibited to us by (a) its definition; its extension, by the complete enumeration of all Divine helps of grace; in other words, by (b) the logical division of the idea, inasmuch as the sum of all the particulars represents, in every science, the logical extent of an idea or term.
<h3 id="A">The definition of actual grace</h3>

<p>The definition of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> is based on the idea of grace in general, which, in Biblical, classical, and modern language, admits of a fourfold meaning. In the first place, subjectively, grace signifies good will, benevolence; then, objectively, it designates every favour which proceeds from this benevolence and, consequently, every gratuitous gift (<em>donum gratuitum, beneficium</em>). In the former (subjective) sense, the king's <em>grace</em> grants life to the criminal condemned to death; in the latter (objective) sense the king distributes <em>graces</em> to his lieges. In this connection grace also stands for charm, attractiveness; as when we speak of the three Graces in mythology, or of the grace poured forth on the lips of the bridegroom (<a href="../bible/psa044.htm#vrs3">Psalm 44:3</a>), because charm calls forth benevolent love in the giver and prompts him to the bestowal of benefactions. As the recipient of graces experiences, on his part, sentiments of gratefulness, and expresses these sentiments in thanks, the word <em>gratiae</em> (plural of <em>gratia</em>) also stands for thanksgiving in the expressions <em>gratias agere</em> and <em>Deo gratias</em>, which have their counterpart in the English, to say grace after meals.

<p>A comparison of these four senses of the word <em>grace</em> reveals a clear relationship of analogy among them, since <em>grace</em>, in its objective signification of "gratuitous gift" or "favour", occupies a central position around which the other meanings may be logically grouped. For the attractiveness of the recipient as well as the benevolence of the giver is the cause, whereas the expression of thanks which proceeds from the grateful disposition is the effect, of the gratuitous gift of grace. This last-mentioned meaning is, consequently the fundamental one in grace. The characteristic idea of a free gift must be taken in the strict sense and exclude merit in every form, be it in the range of commutative justice as, e.g., in sale and purchase, or in that of distributive justice, as is the case in the so-called remunerations and gratuities. Hence St. Paul says: "If by grace, it is not now by works: otherwise grace is no more grace" (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#vrs6">Romans 11:6</a>).

<p>True, even gratuitous Divine gifts may still fall within the range of mere nature. Thus we petition <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, under the guidance of the Church, for mere natural graces, as health, favourable weather, deliverance from plague, famine, and war. Now such natural graces, which appear simultaneously as due and gratuitous, are by no means a contradiction in themselves. For, first, the whole creation is for mankind a gratuitous gift of the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom neither justice nor equity compelled to create the world. And secondly the individual man can, in virtue of his title of creation, lay a rightful claim only to the essential endowments of his nature. Goods granted over and above this class, though belonging to the just demands of human nature in general, have for him the significance of an <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, or favour, as, for example, eminent talents, robust health, perfect limbs, fortitude. We would have omitted mentioning this so-called "grace of creation", had not <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, by emphasizing the gratuitous character of such natural graces, succeeded, at the Synod of Diospolis or Lydda (A.D. 415) in deluding the unsuspecting bishops in regard to the dangers of his heresy. The five African bishops, Augustine among them, in their report to <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a>, rightly called attention to the fact that <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> admitted only the grace through which we are men, but denied grace properly so called, through which we are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">children of God</a>. Whenever Scripture and tradition speak simply of <em>grace</em>, reference is made to a supernatural grace which is opposed to natural grace as to its contrary and lies so far beyond all rightful claim and strenuous effort of the creature that it remains positively undue to the already existing nature, because it includes goods of a Divine order, as, e.g., Divine sonship, indwelling of the Spirit, <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>. Actual grace is of this kind, because as a means, it stands in intrinsic and essential relation to these Divine goods which are the end. As a consequence, the most important element characteristic of its nature must be the supernatural.

<p>As a further determining factor must be added its necessary derivation from the merits of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Christ's redemption</a>; for there is the question of Christian grace. In the Thomist theory of redemption, which considers not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but the Trinity, as the cause of grace in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and in our first parents in Paradise, the addition of this new characteristic appears self-explanatory. As to the Scotists, they derive each and every supernatural grace in heaven and on earth solely from the merits of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">God-Man</a> would have appeared on earth even had Adam not sinned. But they, too, are compelled to introduce, in the present dispensation, a distinction between the "grace of Christ" and the "grace of the Redeemer" for the reason that, in their ideal theory, neither the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> nor the inhabitants of Paradise owe their holiness to the Redeemer. The addition, <em>ex meritis Christi</em>, must therefore be included in the notion of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>. But there are also merely external graces, which owe their existence to the merits of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Christ's redemption</a> &#151; as the Bible, preaching, the crucifix, the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. One of these, the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a>, marks even the highest point of all possible graces. The <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> themselves sought to outdo one another in their encomiums on the excellency of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> example and its effectiveness in suggesting pious thoughts and salutary resolutions. They thus endeavoured to avoid the admission of interior graces inherent in the soul; for these alone were opposed to <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius'</a> proudly virtuous supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> (<em>liberum arbitrium</em>), the whole strength of which resided within itself. For this reason the Church all the more emphatically proclaimed, and still proclaims, the necessity of interior grace for which exterior graces are merely a preparation. Yet there are also interior graces which do not procure the individual sanctification of the recipient, but the sanctification of others through the recipient. These, by the extension of the generic term to specifically designate a new subdivision, are, by antonomasia, called gratuitously given graces (<em>gratia gratis datae</em>). To this class belong the extraordinary charismata of the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miracle-worker</a>, the prophet, the speaker of tongues, etc. (see <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs4">1 Corinthians 12:4 sqq.</a>), as well as the ordinary powers of the priest and confessor. As the object of these graces is, according to their nature, the spread of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> on earth and the sanctification of men, their possession in itself does not exclude personal unholiness. The will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, is that personal righteousness and holiness should also distinguish the possessor. With regard to the personal holiness of man, only that interior grace is of importance which is interiorly inherent in the soul and renders it holy and pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence its name, <em>ingratiating grace</em> (<em>gratia gratum faciens</em>). To this category belongs not only sanctifying, but also <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>.



<p>Taking into account, then, all the elements so far considered, we may define <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> as <em>a supernatural help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for salutary acts granted in consideration of the merits of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</em>

<p>It is called a "help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for salutary acts", because, on the one hand, it differs from permanent sanctifying grace, in that it consists only in a passing influence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the soul, and, on the other, it is destined only for actions which have a necessary relation to man's eternal salvation. It is further called a "supernatural help" so as to exclude from its definition not only all merely natural graces, but also, in a special manner, ordinary Divine conservation and concurrence (<em>concursus generalis divinus</em>). Finally, the "merits of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" are named as its meritorious cause because all graces granted to fallen man are derived from this one source. It is for this reason that the prayers of the Church either invoke <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> directly or conclude with the words: <em>Through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ Our Lord</a>.</em>

<p>We have laid down above, as the most important characteristic of the nature of actual (and of every Christian) grace, its supernatural character. This was done partly because a deeper insight into its nature may be gained from the analysis of this element. As pure nature is in itself completely incapable of performing salutary acts through its own strength, <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> must come to the rescue of its incapacity and supply the deficient powers, without which no supernatural activity is possible. Actual grace thus becomes a special causal principle which communicates to impotent nature moral, and especially physical, powers. Grace, as a moral cause, presupposes the existence of obstacles which render the work of salvation so difficult that their removal is morally impossible without special Divine help. Grace must be brought into operation as healing grace (<em>gratia sanans, medicinalis</em>); <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, bent towards the earth and weakened by concupiscence, is yet filled with love of good and horror of evil. The consciousness of the necessity of this moral influence may become so perfect that we beg of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the grace of a violent victory over our evil nature; witness the celebrated prayer of the Church: "Ad te nostras, etiam rebelles, compelle propitius voluntates" (Vouchsafe to compel our wills to Thee albeit they resist). In the ordinary course of things the Divine inspiration of joy in virtue and aversion from sin will, no doubt, methodically lead to the free performance of salutary acts; but the moral influence of grace can effect the temporary control of freedom in the sinner. The sudden conversion of the Apostle Paul is an illustration of this. It will be readily understood that the above-mentioned triumph over the obstacles to salvation demands in itself a grace which is natural only in substance, but supernatural in mode. Hence many theologians require even for the so-called state of pure nature (which never existed) such natural graces as are mere remedies against the <em>fomes peccati</em> of natural concupiscence. The end of supernatural bliss and the consequently necessary endowment with supernatural means of grace would not have existed in this state (<em>status natura purae</em>), but the disastrous results of an evil tendency unbridled would have been experienced to the same extent as after the fall.

<p>More important than the moral causality of grace is its physical causality, for man must also receive from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the physical power to perform salutary works. Without it, activity in the order of salvation is not only more difficult and laborious, it is altogether impossible. The feet of a child, to draw a comparison from actual life, may be so weak that a mere moral influence, such as the holding out of a beautiful toy, will not suffice to enable it to walk without the physical support of the mother &#151; the use of the leading-strings. The latter situation is the one in which man is placed with regard to supernatural activity.

<p>From the question which is to be discussed later, and which regards the metaphysical necessity of grace for all salutary acts, whether of an easy or difficult nature, it follows, with irresistible logic, that the incapacity of nature cannot be ascribed solely to a mere weakened condition and moral difficulties resulting from sin, but that it must be attributed also, and principally, to physical inability. The communication of the physical power to the soul admits, theologically, of only one interpretation, namely, that grace raises the faculties of the soul (intellect and will) above their natural constitution into a supernatural sphere of being, and thus renders them capable of substantially supernatural operations. The reason why, through our inner consciousness, we can gain no psychological knowledge of this higher activity of the soul lies in the fact that our self-consciousness extends solely to the acts, and in no wise to the substance, of the soul. From this same fact arises the philosophical necessity of proving the spirituality, the immortality, and the very existence of the human soul from the characteristic nature of its activity. Inexorable theological logic postulates the supernatural nature of the acts tending towards our salvation, because theological faith, for example, "the beginning, foundation, and source of all justification", must certainly be of the same supernatural order as the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">intuitive vision of God</a> to which it ultimately leads. The necessity of the physical causality of grace, as is readily seen, is nowise dependent on the existence of concupiscence, but remains just as imperative for our first parents in their state of innocence and for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> subject to no evil tendency. Actual grace, therefore, considered under this aspect, bears the name of "elevating grace" (<em>gratia elevans</em>), though not in a sense which would exclude from it the possibility of simultaneously fulfilling the moral function of healing grace in the present state of man. It is only after these considerations that the comprehension of the nature of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> in all its relations becomes possible, that we may say, with Perrone: Actual grace is that unmerited interior assistance which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in virtue of the merits of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, confers upon fallen man in order to strengthen, on the one hand, his infirmity resulting from sin and, on the other, to render him capable, by elevation to the supernatural order, of supernatural acts of the soul, so that he may attain justification, persevere in it to the end, and thus enter into everlasting life.
<h3 id="B">The logical division of actual grace</h3>

<p>The logical division of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> should enumerate all the kinds to which the definition is universally applicable. If we adopt the different faculties of the soul as our principle of division, we shall have three kinds: graces of the intellect, of the will, and of the sensitive faculties. With regard to the consent of the will we distinguish two pairs of graces: first, preventing and co-operating; then efficacious and merely sufficient grace. It must be immediately shown that all these graces are no arbitrarily invented entities, but actually existing realities.

<h4 id="i">Graces of the different faculties of the soul</h4>

<p>The illuminating grace of the intellect (<em>gratia illuminationis, illustrationis</em>) first presents itself for consideration. It is that grace which in the work of salvation suggests good thoughts to the intellect. This may happen in a twofold manner, either mediately or immediately. The existence of mediate graces of the mind is not only vouched for a priori by the presence of merely external graces, as when a stirring sermon or the sight of the crucifix forces the sinner to earnest reflection; it is also explicitly attested by Holy Writ where the "commandment of the Lord" is represented as "enlightening the eyes" (<a href="../bible/psa018.htm#vrs9">Psalm 18:9</a>), and the external example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as a model for our imitation (I Pet., ii, 21). But, as this mediate grace need neither interrupt the psychological course of the law governing the association of ideas nor be of a strictly supernatural nature, its sole object will be to prepare unostentatiously the way for a grace of greater importance and necessity, immediate illuminating grace. In the latter, the Holy Ghost Himself through immediate elevation and penetration of the powers of the mind prompts the soul and manifests to it in a supernatural light the eternal truths of salvation. Though our sacred discourses be perfect masterpieces of eloquence, though our picture of the wounds of the crucified Saviour be ever so vivid and realistic, they alone can never be the first step towards the conversion of a sinner, except when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a vigorous impulse stirs the heart and, according to an expression of St. Fulgentius (Ep. xvii, De incarn. et grat., n. 67), "opens the ear of the interior man". St. Paul acknowledges, also, that the faith which his own preaching and that of his disciple Apollo had sown in Corinth, and which, under their "planting and watering" (mediate grace of preaching), had taken root, would have miserably perished, had not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself given "the increase". (See <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs6">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>: "Ego plantavi, Apollo rigavit, sed Deus incrementum dedit.") Among the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> none has more strongly emphasized the fruitlessness of preaching without interior illumination than the Doctor of Grace, Augustine, who says among other things: "Magisteria forinsecus adjutoria quaedam sunt et admonitiones; cathedram in caelo habet qui corda tenet" ("Instruction and admonition help somewhat externally, but he who reaches the heart has a place in heaven" &#151; Tract. III, 13, in I Joh.). The more speculative question may now be asked: Whether the mediate and immediate grace of the mind affects the idea, the judgment, or the reasoning. There can be no doubt that it primarily influences the judgment (<em>judicium</em>), be the latter theoretical (e.g. on the credibility of revelation) or practical (e.g. regarding the hideous character of sin). But the reasoning process and the idea (<em>apprehensio</em>) may also become a grace of the mind, firstly, because they both belong to the essence of human knowledge, and grace always operates in a manner conformable to nature; secondly because ideas are in final analysis but the result and fruit of condensed judgments and reasonings.

<p>Besides the grace of the mind, the strengthening grace of the will (generally called <em>gratia inspirationis</em>) plays not only the most important, but an indispensable, part, for no works of salvation are even thinkable without operations of the will. It may also be either mediate or immediate, according as the pious affections and wholesome resolutions are awakened in the soul by the immediately preceding illumination of the mind or by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself (by appropriation the Holy Ghost). Owing to the psychological interpenetration of cognition and volition, every (mediate or immediate) grace of the mind is in itself also a grace affecting the will. This twofold action &#151; on intellect and will &#151; has therefore the significance of two different acts of the soul, but of only one grace. Consequently, immediate elevation and motion of the will by the Holy Spirit can alone be considered a new grace. The <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> logically denied the existence especially of this grace, even if, according to the improbable opinion of some historians of dogma, they were forced by Augustine in the course of the debate to admit at least the immediate grace of the mind. Augustine threw in the whole weight of his personality in favour of the existence and necessity of the grace of the will, to which he applied the names, <em>delectatio caelestis, inspiratio dilectionis, cupiditas boni</em>, and the like. The celebrated Provincial Council of Carthage (A.D. 418) confirmed his teaching when it declared that grace does not simply consist in the manifestation of the Divine precepts whereby we may know our positive and negative duties, but it also confers upon us the power to love and accomplish whatever we have recognized as righteous in things pertaining to salvation (cf. Denzinger, "Enchiridion", 10th ed., n. 104, Freiburg, 1908). The Church has never shared the ethical optimism of Socrates, which made virtue consist in mere knowledge, and held that mere teaching was sufficient to inculcate it. If even natural virtue must be fought for, and is acquired only through energetic work an constant practice, how much more does not a supernatural life of virtue require the Divine help of grace with which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> must freely co-operate, and thus advance by slow degrees in perfection. The strengthening grace of the will, like the grace of the mind, assumes the form of vital acts of the soul and manifests itself chiefly in what are called affections of the will. Scholastic psychology enumerates eleven such affections, namely: love and hatred, delight and sadness, desire and aversion, hope and despair, daring and fear, finally, anger. This whole list of feelings has, with the sole exception of despair, which imperils the work of salvation, a practical significance in relation to good and evil; these affections may therefore develop into real graces of the will. But, inasmuch as all motions of the will may be ultimately reduced to love as fundamental feeling (cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/2025.htm#article2">Summa I-II:25:2</a>), the functions of the grace of the will may be systematically focussed in love; hence the concise declaration of the above-mentioned Synod of Carthage (1. c.): "Cum sit utrumque donum Dei, et scire Quid facere debeamus et diligere ut faciamus" (Since both are gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; the knowing what we ought to do, and the desire to do it). But care must be taken not to understand immediately, by this "love", perfect love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which comes only at the end of the process of justification as the crowning-stone of the edifice, even though Augustine (<a href="../fathers/130108.htm"><em>On the Holy Trinity</em> VIII.10</a>, and frequently) honours with the name <em>caritas</em> the mere love for good and any good motion of the will whatsoever. Berti (De theol. discipl., XIV, 7), therefore, is wrong when he asserts that, according to Augustine, the only grace properly so called is the theological virtue of charity. Are faith, hope, contrition, fear, only graces improperly so called, or do they become graces in the true sense only in connection with charity?

<p>It cannot be determined with certainty of faith whether to the graces of mind and will so far spoken of should be added special actual graces affecting the sensitive faculties of the soul. But their existence may be asserted with great probability. For if, according to an appropriate remark of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De anima, I, viii), it is true that thinking is impossible without imagination, supernatural thought also must find its originator and point of support in a corresponding phantasm to which, like the ivy on the wall, it clings and thus creeps upward. At any rate, the harmonious agreement of the grace of the intellect with the accompanying phantasm can but be of favourable influence on the soul visited by grace. It is likewise clear that in the rebellious motions of concupiscence, which reside in the sensitive faculties, the grace of the will has a dangerous enemy which must be overcome by the infusion of contrary dispositions, as aversion from sin, before the will is aroused to make firm resolutions. Paul, consequently, thrice be sought the Lord that the sting of the flesh might depart from him, but was answered: "Sufficit tibi gratia mea" (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs9">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).

<p>If we take the attitude of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> as the dividing principle of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, we must first have a grace which precedes the free determination of the will and another which follows this determination and co-operates with the will. This is the first pair of graces, preventing and co-operating grace (<em>gratia praeveniens et cooperans</em>). Preventing grace must, according to its physical nature consist in unfree, indeliberate vital acts of the soul; co-operating grace, on the contrary, solely in free, deliberate actions of the will. The latter assume the character of actual graces, not only because they are immediately suggested by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also because they may become, after the achievement of success, the principle of new salutary acts. In this manner an intense act of perfect love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may simultaneously effect and, as it were, assure by itself the observance of the Divine commandments. The existence of preventing grace, officially determined by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, cap. v), must be admitted with the same certainty as the facts that the illuminating grace of the intellect belongs to a faculty not free in itself and that the grace of the will must first and foremost exhibit itself in spontaneous, indeliberate, unfree emotions. This is proved by the Biblical metaphors of the reluctant hearing of the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/jer017.htm">Jeremiah 17:23</a>; <a href="../bible/psa094.htm#vrs8">Psalm 94:8</a>), of the drawing by the Father (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm">John 6:44</a>), of the knocking at the gate (<a href="../bible/rev003.htm">Apocalypse 3:20</a>). The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> bear witness to the reality of preventing grace in their very appropriate formula: "Gratia est in nobis, sed sine nobis", that is, grace as a vital act is in the soul, but as an unfree, salutary act it does not proceed from the soul, but immediately from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus Augustine (De grat. et lib. arbitr., xvii 33), <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (Moral., XVI, x), Bernard of Clairvaux (De grat. et lib. arbitr., xiv), and others. As the unfree emotion of the will are by their very nature destined to elicit free salutary acts, it is clear that preventing grace must develop into helping or co-operating grace as soon as <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> gives its consent. These free salutary acts are, according to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, cap. xvi), not only actual graces, but also meritorious actions (<em>actus meritorii</em>). There is just as little doubt possible regarding their existence as concerning the fact that many men freely follow the call of grace, work out their eternal salvation, and attain the beatific vision, so that the dogma of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Christian heaven</a> proves simultaneously the reality of co-operating graces. Their principal advocate is Augustine (De grat. et lib. arbitr., xvi, 32). If the more philosophical question of the co-operation of grace and liberty be raised, it will be easily perceived that the supernatural element of the free salutary act can be only from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, its vitality only from the will. The postulated unity of the action of the will could evidently not be safeguarded, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the will Performed either two separate acts or mere halves of an act. It can exist only when the supernatural power of grace transforms itself into the vital strength of the will, constitutes the latter as a free faculty <em>in actu primo</em> by elevation to the supernatural order, and simultaneously co-operates as supernatural Divine concurrence in the performance of the real salutary act or <em>actus secundus.</em> This co-operation is not unlike that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the creature in the natural order, in which both perform together one and the same act, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as first cause (<em>causa prima</em>), the creature as secondary cause (<em>causa secunda</em>). For further particulars see <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Contra Gent.", III, lxx.

<p>A second pair of graces important for the understanding of the controversies on grace is that of efficacious and merely sufficient grace (<em>gratia efficax et mere sufficiens</em>). By efficacious grace is understood that Divine assistance which, considered even <em>in actu primo</em>, includes with infallible certainty, and consequently in its definition, the free salutary act; for did it remain inefficacious, it would cease to be efficacious and would therefore be self-contradictory. As to whether the infallibility of its success is the result of the physical nature of this grace or of the infallible foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<em>scientia media</em>) is a much debated question between Thomists and Molinists which need not be further treated here. Its existence, however, is admitted as an article of faith by both sides and is established with the same firmness as the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the elect or the existence of a heaven peopled with innumerable saints. As to "merely sufficient grace", <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> have, as is well known, eliminated it from their doctrinal system. They admitted only efficacious graces whose action overpowers the will and leaves no room for freedom. If Jansen (d. 1638) nominally admitted "sufficient grace", calling it "little grace" (<em>gratia parva</em>), he understood by it, in reality, only "insufficient grace", i.e. "one from which no action can result, except its insufficiency be removed by another grace" (De grat. Christ., IV, x). He did not shrink from reviling sufficient grace, understood in the Catholic sense, as a monstrous conception and a means of filling <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> with reprobates, while later <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> discovered in it such a pernicious character as to infer the appropriateness of the prayer: "a gratia sufficiente, libera nos Domine" ("From sufficient grace, O Lord deliver us". &#151; Cf. prop. 6 damn. ab Alex. VIII, a. 1690 in Denzinger, n. 1296). The Catholic idea of sufficient grace is obtained by the distinction of a twofold element in every <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, its intrinsic energy (<em>potestas agendi, vis</em>) and its extrinsic efficiency (<em>efficientia</em>). Under the former aspect there exists between sufficient and efficacious grace, both considered <em>in actu primo</em>, no real, but only a logical, distinction; for sufficient grace also confers full power for action, but is condemned to unfruitfulness owing to the free resistance of the will. If, on the contrary, extrinsic efficiency be considered, it is evident that the will either co-operates freely or not . If it refuses its co-operation, even the strongest grace remains a merely sufficient one (<em>gratia mere sufficiens</em>) although by nature it would have been completely sufficient (<em>gratia vere sufficiens</em>) and with good will could have been efficacious. This ecclesiastical conception of the nature of sufficient grace, to which the Catholic systems of grace must invariably conform themselves, is nothing else but a reproduction of the teaching of the Bible. To cite only one text (<a href="../bible/pro001.htm#vrs24">Proverbs 1:24</a>), the calling and the stretching-out of the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> certainly signifies the complete sufficiency of grace, just as the obstinate refusal of the sinner "to regard", is tantamount to the free rejection of the proffered hand. Augustine is in complete agreement with the constant tradition on this point, and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> have vainly claimed him as one of their own. We have an example of his teaching in the following text: "Gratia Dei est quae hominum adjuvat voluntates; qua ut non adjuventur, in ipsis itidem causa est, non in Deo" ("It is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> that helps the wills of men; and when they are not helped by it, the reason is in themselves, not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." &#151; <a href="../fathers/15012.htm"><em>Of Sin and Merit</em> II.17</a>). On the Greek Fathers see Isaac Habert, Theologia Graecor. Patrum, II, 6 sq. (Paris, 1646).
<h2 id="section2">Properties of actual grace</h2>

<p>After the treatment of the nature of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, we come logically to the discussion of its properties. These are three in number: necessity, gratuity, and universality.
<h3 id="A">The necessity of actual grace</h3>

<p>With the early <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, the necessity of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> may be so exaggerated as to lead to the assertion of the absolute and complete incapacity of mere nature to do good; or, with the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> and Semipelagians, it may be so understood as to extend the capacity of nature to each and every thing, even to supernatural activity, or at least to its essential elements. The three heresies of early <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, and Semipelagianism furnish us with the practical division which we adopt for the systematic exposition of the Catholic doctrine.

<h4 id="i">Early Protestantism and Jansenism</h4>

<p>We maintain against early <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> the capacity of mere nature in regard to both religious knowledge and moral action. Fundamental for natural k00religion and ethics is the article of faith which asserts the power of mere reason to derive a certain natural knowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from creation (Vatican., Sess. III, de revelat., can. i). This is a central truth which is most clearly attested by Scripture (Wisdom, xiii, 1 sqq.; Rom., I, 20 sq.; ii, 14 sq.) and tradition. Unswervingly adhering to this position, the Church has ever exhibited herself as a mighty defender of reason and its inherent powers against the ravages of scepticism so subversive of all truth. Through the whole course of centuries she has steadfastly clung to the unalterable conviction that a faculty of perception constituted for vision, like human reason, cannot possibly be condemned to blindness, and that its natural powers enable it to know, even in the fallen state, whatever is within its legitimate sphere. On the other hand, the Church also erected against presumptuous Rationalism and Theosophism a bulwark for the defence of knowledge by faith, a knowledge superior to, and different in principle from rational knowledge. With Clement of Alexandria she drew a sharp distinction between <em>gnosis</em> and <em>pistis</em> &#151; knowledge and faith, philosophy and revelation, assigning to reason the double role of indispensable forerunner and docile handmaid (cf. Vatican., Sess. III, cap. iv). This noble struggle of the Church for the rights of reason and it true relation to faith explains historically her decidedly hostile attitude towards the scepticism of Nicholas de Ultricuria (A.D. 1348), towards the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> philosophy of Pomponatius (1513) defending a "twofold truth", towards the so-called "log-stick-and-stone" theory (<em>Klotz-Stock-und-Steintheorie</em>) of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a> and his followers, so inimical to reason, towards the doctrine of the complete powerlessness of nature without grace defended by Baius and Jansen, towards the system of Hermes impregnated with <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> criticism, towards traditionalism, which based all moral and religious knowledge on the authority of language and instruction, finally, against the modern Agnosticism of the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a>, which undermines the very foundations of faith and which was only recently dealt so fatal a blow by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X's</a> condemnation. Documentary evidence has thus been produced that the Catholic Church far from being an "institution of obscurantism", has at all times fulfilled a powerful and far-reaching mission of civilization, since she took reason and science under her powerful patronage and defended their rights against those very oppressors of reason who are accustomed to bring against her the groundless charge of intellectual inferiority. A sound intellectualism is just as indispensable a condition of her life as the doctrine of a supernatural order raised above all the limits of nature. (cf. Chastel, "De la valeur de la raison humaine", Paris, 1854.)

<p>Not less reasonable an attitude was assumed by the Church respecting the moral capabilities of fallen man in the domain of natural ethics. Against Baianism, the forerunner of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, she adhered in her teaching to the conviction confirmed by healthy experience, that natural man is capable of performing some naturally good works without <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, and particularly without the grace of faith, and that not all the deeds of infidels and pagans are sins. This is evidenced by the condemnation of two propositions of Baius by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a> in the year 1567: "Liberum arbitrium sine gratiae Dei adjutorio nonnisi ad peccandum valet" ("Free will without the aid of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">God's grace</a> avails for nothing but sin." &#151; Prop. xxvii), and again: "Omnia opera infidelium sunt peccata et philosophorum virtutes sunt vitia" ("All the acts of infidels are sins, and their virtues are vices." &#151; Prop. 25). The history of paganism and everyday experience condemn, moreover, with equal emphasis these extravagant exaggerations of Baius. Among the duties of the natural moral law some &#151; as love for parents or children, abstention from theft and drunkenness &#151; are of such an elementary character that it is impossible to perceive why they could not be fulfilled without grace and faith at least by judicious, cultured, and noble-minded pagans. Did not the Saviour himself recognize as something good natural human love and fraternal greeting, such as they exist also among publicans and pagans? He denied to them only a supernatural reward (<em>mercedem</em>, <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs46">Matthew 5:46 sq.</a>). And Paul has explicitly stated that "the Gentiles, who have not the [Mosaic] law, do by nature [<em>naturaliter, physei</em>] those things that are of the law" (Rom., ii, 14). The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> did not judge differently. Baius, it is true, adduced Augustine as his chief witness, and in the latter's writings we find, to be sure, sentences which seem to favour him. Baius, however, overlooked the fact that the former rhetorician and Platonic idealist of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> does not always weigh every word as carefully as the wary Schoolman <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, but consciously delights (cf. <a href="../fathers/1801096.htm"><em>Enarration on Psalm 96</em>, no. 19</a>) in antonomastically applying to the genus the designation which belongs only to the highest species. As he calls the least good motion of the will <em>caritas</em>, by anticipation, so he brands every unmeritorious work (<em>opus steriliter bonum</em>) as sin (<em>peccatum</em>) and false virtue (<em>falsa virtus</em>). In both cases it is an obvious use of the rhetorical figure called catachresis. With a strong perception for the ethically good, wherever it may be found, he eulogizes elsewhere the chastity of his heathen friend Alypius (Confess., VI, x) and of the pagan Polemo (Ep. cxl, 2), admires the civil virtues of the Romans, the masters of the world (Ep. cxxxviii, 3), and gives expression to the truth that even the most wicked man is not found completely wanting in naturally good works ("De Spiritu et litera", c. xxviii. &#151; Cf. <a href="../cathen/13062b.htm">Ripalda</a>, "De Ente supernaturali", tom. III: "Adversus Baium et Baianos", Cologne, 1648; J. Ernst, "Werke und Tugenden der Unglaubigen nach Augustinus", Freiburg, 1871).

<p>The ethical capacity of pure, and especially of fallen, nature has undoubtedly also its determined limits which it cannot overstep. In a general manner, the possibility of the observance of the easier natural precepts without the aid of natural or supernatural grace may be asserted, but not the possibility of the observance of the more difficult commandments and prohibitions of the natural law. The difficulty of determining where the easy ends and the difficult begins will naturally lead, in some secondary questions, to great diversity of opinion among theologians. In fundamental points, however, harmony is easily obtainable and exists in fact. In the first place, all without exception are agreed on the proposition that fallen man cannot of his own strength observe the natural law in its entirety and for a long time without occasional errors and lapses into grievous sin. And how could he? For, according to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, Cap. xiii), even the already justified man will be victorious in the "conflict with the flesh, the world, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>" only on condition that he co-operate with never-failing grace (cf. Rom., vii, 22 sqq.). Secondly, all theologians admit that the natural will, unaided by Divine assistance, succumbs, especially in the fallen state, with moral (not physical) necessity to the attack of vehement and enduring temptations against the Decalogue. For could it by its own strength decide the conflict in its own favour even at the most critical moments, that power which we have just eliminated would be restored to it, namely the power to observe unaided, through the prompt victory over vehement temptations, the whole natural law in all its extent. The practical significance of this second universally admitted proposition lies in the acknowledgment that, according to revelation, there is no man on earth who does not occasionally meet with this or that grievous temptation to mortal sin, and even the justified are no exception to this law; wherefore, even they are bound to constant vigilance in fear and trembling and to never-ceasing prayer for Divine assistance (cf. Council of Trent, 1. c.). In the third question, whether natural love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even in its highest form (<em>amor Dei naturalis perfectus</em>), is possible without grace, the opinions of theologians are still very divergent. <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> denies this possibility on the ground that, without any grace, a mere natural justification could in such a case be brought into being through the love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Scotus, on the contrary, spiritedly defends the attainability of the highest natural love for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A golden middle course will easily open to the one who accurately distinguishes between affective and effective love. The affective element of the highest love is, as natural duty, accessible to the mere natural will with out grace. Effective love, on the contrary, since it supposes an unchanging, systematic, and active will, would entail the above-discarded possibility of triumphing over all temptations and of observing the whole moral law. (For further details on these interesting problems, see Pohle, "Lehrbuch der Dogmatik", 4th ed., II, 364-70, <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1909.)

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, the mere absence of the state of grace and love (<em>status gratiae et caritatis</em>) branded as sins all the deeds of the sinner, even the ethically good ones (e.g., almsgiving). This was the lowest ebb in its disparagement and depreciation of the moral forces in man; and here, too, Baius had paved the way. The possession of sanctifying grace or theological love thus became the measure and criterion of natural morality. Taking as his basis the total corruption of nature through original sin (i.e. concupiscence) as taught by early <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, Quesnel, especially (Prop. xliv in Denzinger, n. 1394), gave the above-expressed thought the alleged Augustinian form that there is no medium between love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and love of the world, charity and concupiscence, so that even the prayers of the impious are nothing else but sins. (Cfr. Prop. xlix: "Oratio impiorum est novum peccatum et quod Deus illis concedit, est novum in eos judicium"). The answer of the Church to such severe exaggerations was the dogmatic Bull, "Unigenitus" (1713), of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Pope Clement XI</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, can. vii) had however already decreed against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a>: "Si quis dixerit, opera omnia quae ante justificationem fiunt . . . vere esse peccata . . . anathema sit" (If anyone shall say that all the works done before justification are indeed sins, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>). Moreover, what reasonable man would concede that the process of justification with its so-called dispositions consists in a long series of sins? And if the Bible, in order to effect the conversion of the sinner, frequently summons him to contrition and penance, to prayer and almsdeeds, shall we admit the blasphemy that the Most Holy summons him to the commission of so many sins?

<p>The Catholic doctrine on this point obstinately adhered to through all the centuries, is so clear that even an Augustine could not have departed from it without becoming a public heretic. True, Baius and Quesnel succeeded in cleverly concealing their heresy in a phraseology similar to the Augustinian, but without penetrating the meaning of Augustine. The latter, it must be conceded, in the course of the struggle with self-confident <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, ultimately so strongly emphasized the opposition between grace and sin, love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and love of the world, that the intermediary domain of naturally good works almost completely disappeared. But Scholasticism had long since applied the necessary correction to this exaggeration. That the sinner, in consequence of his habitual state of sin, must sin in everything, is not the doctrine of Augustine. The universality of sin in the world which he contemplated, is not for him the result of a fundamental necessity, but merely the manifestation of a general historical phenomenon which admits of exceptions (De spir. et lit., c. xxvii, n. 48). He specifically declares marital love, love of children and friends to be something lawful in all men, something commendable, natural and dutiful, even though Divine love alone leads to heaven. He admits the possibility of these natural virtues also in the impious: "Sed videtis, istam caritatem esse posse et impiorum, i.e. paganorum, Judaeorum, haereticorum" (Serm. cccxlix de temp. in Migne, P.L., XXXIX, 1529).

<h4 id="ii">Pelagianism</h4>

<p><a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, which still survives under new forms, fell into the extreme directly opposed to the theories rejected above. It exaggerated the capacity of human nature to an incredible degree, and hardly left any room for Christian grace. It amounted to nothing less than the divinization of the moral forces of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Even when it was question of acts tending to supernatural salvation, natural will was declared able to rise by its own strength from justification to eternal life. Rank naturalism in its essence, <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> contained, as a logical consequence, the suppression of original sin and the negation of grace. It laid down the proud assertion that the sovereign will may ultimately raise itself to complete holiness and impeccability (<em>impeccantia, anamartesia</em>) through the persevering observance of all the precepts, even the most difficult, and through the infallible triumph over every temptation, even the most vehement. This was an unmistakable reproduction of the ancient Stoic ideal of virtue. For the self-confident <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a>, the petition of the Lord's Prayer, "Lead us not into temptation", served, properly speaking, no purpose: it was at most a proof of his humility, not a profession of the truth. In no other part of the system is the vanity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Diogenes so glaringly perceptible through the lacerated cloak of the philosopher. Hence the Provincial Synod of Carthage (418) insisted on the true doctrine on this very point (see Denzinger, nn. 106-8) and emphasized the absolute necessity of grace for all salutary acts. True, <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> (d. 405) and his disciple Caelestius, who found an active associate in the skilful and learned Bishop Julian of Eclanum, admitted from the beginning the improper creative grace, later also a merely external supernatural grace, such as the Bible and the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But the heresiarch rejected with all the more obstinacy the inner grace of the Holy Ghost, especially for the will. The object of grace was, at the most, to facilitate the work of salvation, in no wise to make it fundamentally possible. Never before had a heretic dared to lay the axe so unsparingly to the deepest roots of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. And never again did it occur in ecclesiastical history that one man alone, with the weapons of the mind and ecclesiastical science overthrew and annihilated in one generation an equally dangerous heresy. This man was Augustine. In the short period between A.D. 411 and A.D. 413 no fewer than twenty-four synods were held which considered the heresy of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>. But the death-blow was dealt as early as 416 at <a href="../cathen/10304b.htm">Mileve</a>, where fifty-nine bishops, under the leadership of St. Augustine, laid down the fundamental canons which were subsequently (418) repeated at Carthage and received, after the celebrated "Tractoria" of Pope Zosimus (418), the value of definitions of faith. It was there that the absolute necessity of grace for salvation triumphed over the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> idea of its mere utility, and the absolute incapacity of nature over supreme self-sufficiency. When Augustine died, in 430, <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> was dead. The decisions of faith issued at <a href="../cathen/10304b.htm">Mileve</a> and Carthage were frequently renewed by ecumenical councils, as in 529 at Orange, lastly at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> (Sess. VI, can. ii).

<p>The beautiful parable of the vine and its branches (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs1">John 15:1 sqq.</a>) should have been sufficient to reveal to <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> what a striking contrast there was between it and antecedent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Augustine and the synods time and again used it in the controversy as a very decisive proof out of the mouth of the Saviour Himself. Only when the supernatural vital union of the Apostles with the vine (<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>) planted by the Father is established, does it become possible to bring forth supernatural fruit; for "without me you can do nothing" (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm">John 15:5</a>). The categorical assertion of the necessity of grace for the holy Apostles themselves brings home to us still more forcibly the absolute incapacity of mere fallen nature in the performance of salutary acts. All supernatural activity may be concretely summed up in the three following elements: salutary thoughts, holy resolves, good actions. Now the Apostle Paul teaches that right thinking is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#vrs5">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>), that the righteous will must be based on Divine mercy (Rom. ix, 16), finally that it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who works in us, "both to will and to accomplish" (Phil., ii, 13). The victorious struggle of St. Augustine, which earned for him the honourable title of "Doctor of Grace", was merely a struggle for the ancient Catholic truth. <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> was immediately felt in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community as a thorn in the flesh and as the poison of novelty. Before all the world Augustine could attest: "Talis est haeresis pelagiana, non antiqua, sed ante non multum tempus exorta" ("Such is the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian heresy</a>, not ancient, but having sprung up a short time ago." &#151; De grat., et lib. arbitr., c. iv). In fact, the teaching of the most ancient <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, e.g. Irenaeus (Adv. haer., III, xvii, 2), did not differ from that of Augustine, although it was less vigorous and explicit. The constant practice of prayer in the ancient Church pointed significantly to her lively faith in the necessity of grace, for prayer and grace are correlative ideas, which cannot be separated. Hence the celebrated axiom of <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Pope Celestine I</a> (d. 432): "Ut legem credendi statuat lex supplicandi" ("That the law of prayer may determine the law of belief" &#151; See Denzinger, n. 139). It is clearly evident that the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> wished the universally expressed necessity of grace to be understood not merely a moral necessity for the strengthening of human weakness, but as a metaphysical one for the communication of physical powers. For in their comparisons they state that grace is not less necessary than are wings for flying, the eyes for seeing, the rain for the growth of plants, etc. In accordance with this, they also declare that, in as far as supernatural activity is concerned, grace is just as indispensable for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> not subect to concupiscence, and was for man before the fall, as it is for man after the sin of Adam.

<p>There is need of special refutation of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius's</a> presumptuous contention that man is capable of avoiding unaided during his whole lifetime all sins; nay, that he can even rise to impeccability. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, can. xxiii), with much more precision than the Synod of <a href="../cathen/10304b.htm">Mileve</a> (416), answered this monstrosity with the definition of faith: "Si quis hominem semel justificatum dixerit . . posse in tota vita peccata omnia etiam venialia vitare, nisi ex speciali Dei privilegio, quemadmodum de beata Virgine tenet ecclesia, anathema sit" (If anyone shall say that a man once justified . . . can, throughout his life, avoid all sins, even venial, unless by a special privilege of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the Church believes of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Bl. Virgin Mary</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>).

<p>This celebrated canon presents some difficulties of thought which must be briefly discussed. In its gist it is an affirmation that not even the justified, much less the sinner and infidel, can avoid all sins, especially venial ones, through his whole life except by special privilege such as was granted to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. The canon does not assert that besides Mary other saints, as St. Joseph or <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, possessed this privilege. Almost all theologians rightly consider this to be the sole exception, justified only by the dignity of the Divine maternity. Justice is done to the wording of the canon, if by <em>tota vita</em> we understand a long period, about a generation, and by <em>peccata venialia</em> chiefly the semi-deliberate venial sins due to surprise or precipitancy. It is in no way declared that a great saint is unable to keep free from all sin during a short interval, as the interval of a day; nor that he is incapable of avoiding for a long time with ordinary grace and without special privilege all venial sins committed with full deliberation or complete liberty. The same must be said with still greater reason of mortal sins, although the preservation of baptismal innocence may be of rare occurrence. The expression, <em>omnia peccata</em>, must be understood collectively, as applying to the sum, and not distributively, as meaning each individual sin, which would no longer be a sin if it could not be avoided in every instance For the same reason the words, <em>non posse</em>, designate not a physical, but a moral impossibility of avoiding sin, i.e. a difficulty based on insuperable obstacles which only a special privilege could suppress. The meaning is, therefore: The observer of a long series of temptations in the life of a just man will find that at some time or other, today or tomorrow, the will held captive by concupiscence will succumb with moral necessity. This may be due to negligence, surprise, weariness, or moral weakness &#151; all of which are factors that do not completely destroy the freedom of the will and thus admit at least of a venial sin. This hard truth must naturally grieve a proud heart. But it is precisely to curb pride, that most dangerous enemy of our salvation, and to nourish in us the precious virtue of humility, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> permits these falls into sin. Nothing incites us more powerfully to vigilance and perseverance in prayer than the consciousness of our sinfulness and infirmity. Even the greatest saint must, therefore, pray daily not out of <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a> or self-deception, but out of an intimate knowledge of his heart: "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors" (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs12">Matthew 6:12</a>). A holy Apostle had to acknowledge of himself and his intimate friends: "In many things we all offend" (<a href="../bible/jam003.htm">James 3:2</a>). Boldly, could the hagiographer in the Old Testament raise the question not difficult of answer: "Who can say: My heart is clean, I am pure from sin?" (<a href="../bible/pro020.htm">Proverbs 20:9</a>). This view, defended by the Bible, was also the constant sentiment of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, to whom the proud language of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> was unknown. To the latter's consideration Augustine (De nat. et grat., xxxvi) presents the impressive thoughts: "Could we bring together here in living form all the saints of both sexes and question them whether they were without sin, would they not exclaim unanimously: 'If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us'?" (<a href="../bible/1jo001.htm">1 John 1:8</a>)

<h4 id="iii">Semipelagianism</h4>

<p>Semipelagianism is an unsuccessful attempt to effect a compromise between <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> and Augustinism, attributing to mere nature and its capabilities a somewhat greater importance in matters pertaining to salvation than Augustine was willing to concede. Several pious monks of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> (hence also the name of "Massilians"), John Cassian (d. 432) at their head, held (about A.D. 428) the following opinion of the relationship between nature and grace: <ul><li>A distinction must be established between "the beginning of faith" (<em>initium fidei</em>) and "increase in the faith" (<em>augmentum fidei</em>); the former may be referred to the natural power of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, while increase in the faith and faith itself can only be the work of Christian grace. <li>Nature can merit grace through its own efforts, but this natural merit (<em>meritum naturae</em>) is only founded in equity, it does not confer, as <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> contended, a right in strict justice. <li><a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">"Final perseverance"</a> (<em>donum perseverantiae</em>) specifically can be secured by the justified with their own strength, and is therefore not a special grace. <li>The bestowal or denial of baptismal grace in children is dependent on their conditional future merits or demerits, which the Omniscience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foresaw not historically, but hypothetically from eternity.</ul> Although this last proposition is philosophically false, the Church has never condemned it as heretical; the first three theses, on the contrary, have been rejected as opposed to Catholic teaching.

<p>Informed by his disciples, Prosper and Hilary, of events at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, Augustine energetically set to work, in spite of his advanced age, and wrote his two books against the Semipelagians: "De Praedestinatione sanctorum" and "De dono perseverantiae". Simultaneously he humbly acknowledged that he had the misfortune of having professed similar errors previously to his episcopal consecration (A.D. 394). He attacked resolutely, though with mildness and moderation, all the positions of his adversaries, rightly looking upon their attitude as a relapse into the already defeated <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>. After Augustine's death, his disciples resumed the struggle. They succeeded in interesting in their cause <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Pope Celestine I</a>, who, in his dogmatic writing to the bishops of Gaul (431), laid down as a rule of faith the fundamental teaching of St. Augustine on original sin and grace. But as this so-called "Indiculus" was issued more as a papal instruction than as an <em>ex cathedra</em> definition, the controversy still continued for almost a century, until St. Caesarius of Arles convoked the Second Synod of Orange (A.D. 529). This synod received the solemn confirmation of <a href="../cathen/02660a.htm">Pope Boniface II</a> (530) and was thus vested with &oelig;cumenical authority. (According to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a> and Gutberlet this confirmation extended only to the first eight canons and the epilogue.) From now on Semipelagianism, also, was proscribed as heresy, and Augustinism was completely victorious.

<p>In the refutation of Semipelagianism, in so far as the necessity of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> is concerned, it will not be amiss to follow an adult through all the stage on the way to salvation, from the state of unbelief and mortal sin to the state of grace and a happy death. With regard, first, to the period of unbelief, the Second Synod of Orange (can. v) decreed that prevenient grace is absolutely necessary to the infidel not only for faith itself, but also for the very beginning of faith. By the "beginning of faith", it intended to designate all the good aspirations and motions to believe which precede faith properly so called, as early dawn precedes sunrise. Consequently, the whole preparation for the faith is made under the influence of grace, e.g. the instruction of persons to be converted. The accuracy of this view is confirmed by the Bible. According to the assurance of the Saviour, external preaching is useless if the invisible influence of grace (the being drawn by the Father) does not set in to effect the gradual "coming" to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs44">John 6:44</a>). Were faith rooted in mere nature, were it based on mere natural inclination to believe or on natural merit, nature could legitimately glory in its own achievement of the work of salvation in its entirety, from faith to justification--nay, to beatific vision itself. And still Paul (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#vrs7">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>; <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#vrs8">Ephesians 2:8 sq.</a>) abominates nothing so much as the "glorying" of nature. Although Augustine could substantiate his doctrine by references to the anterior <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, as <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, he seems to have been embarrassed by the Semipelagian appeal to the Greeks, chiefly <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>. He pleaded the circumstances of the time (De praed. sanctor., c. xiv). In fact, difference of doctrine between the East and the West cannot be denied. With delight could the Semipelagians quote from <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> passages like the following: "We must first select good and then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> adds what appertains to his office; he does not act antecedently to our will so as not to destroy our liberty" (Hom. xii in Hebr., n. 3). How must this attitude of the Eastern Church be explained?

<p>To gain a correct notion of the then existing circumstances, it must be remembered that the Greeks had to defend not only grace, but almost more so the freedom of the will. For the antichristian systems of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, Manichaeism, and neo-Platonism--all products of the East--stood completely under the spell of the liberty-destroying philosophy of fatalism. In such an environment it was important to preserve intact the freedom of the will even under the influence of grace, to arouse slothful nature from the fatalistic sleep, and to recommend the ascetical maxim: "Help yourself, and Heaven will help you." It may have been imprudent to leave the necessity of prevenient grace altogether in the background because of false considerations of timeliness, and to insist almost exclusively on co-operating grace while silently presupposing the existence of prevenient grace. But was <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> opposing a <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> or a <a href="../cathen/03404a.htm">Cassian</a>? In fact he also knew and admitted prevenient grace, as when he writes: "You do not hold of yourself, but you have received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence you have received what you possess and not only this or that, but everything you have. For these are not your own merits, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a>. Although you cite faith, you owe it nevertheless to call" (Hom. xii in I Cor.). <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> was always orthodox in the doctrine on grace.

<p>After the triumph over unbelief, the process of justification begins with faith and concludes only with the infusion of sanctifying grace and theological love. The question is whether, on this arduous road, grace must precede and co-operate with every salutary step of the believing sinner. The negative attitude of the Semipelagians, who ascribed the dispositions for justification to the natural efforts of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, was proscribed as heretical at Orange (can. vii) and again at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> (Sess. VI, can. iii). Rightly so. For the thoroughly <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">supernatural sonship of God</a> (<em>filiatio adoptiva</em>), which ultimately terminates the process of justification, can be attained only through absolutely supernatural acts, for the performance of which nature without grace is physically incapable. Hence the Bible, besides faith, also refers other dispositions, as "hope" (Rom., xv, 13) and "love" (I John, iv, 7) explicitly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their author; and tradition has unswervingly adhered to the priority of grace (cf. St. Augustine, "Enchir.", xxxii). Once the adult has finally reached the state of grace after a happy termination of the process of justification, the obligation devolves upon him of complying with many negative and positive duties in order to preserve sanctifying grace, persevere in virtue until the end, and gain heaven after a happy death. Will he be capable of accomplishing all this without a constant stream of actual graces? It might appear so. For the justified person is, through the possession of sanctifying grace and supernatural virtues, permanently maintained in the supernatural order. It is not unnatural, therefore, to admit, prescinding from <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">final perseverance</a>, that he is enabled by his supernatural habit to perform salutary actions. This is in reality the teaching of Molina, Bellarmine, Billot, and others. But to this view Perrone (De gratia, n. 203) rightly objects that Holy Writ makes no distinction between the different degrees of the work of salvation, that Augustine (De nat. et grat., xxiv) proclaims the constant need of grace also for the "healthy" and "justified", and finally that the Church requires an uninterrupted influence of grace even for the good works of the just and puts in the mouths of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> without exception the prayer: "Actiones nostras, quaesumus Domine, aspirando praeveni et adjuvando prosequere", etc. And does not concupiscence, which remains also in the justified, stand in need of at least healing grace? Moreover, no passive habit puts itself in motion, but, like a well-tuned harp, must be, as it were, brought into play by some external agency. It might be added that nature, raised to a permanent supernatural state, still retains its natural activity and consequently requires a supernatural impulse for supernatural actions.

<p>The most important concern, however, which the just man must take to heart is <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">final perseverance</a>, because it is a decided characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> and assures entrance into heaven with infallible certainty. The Semipelagian delusion that this great grace may be due to the initiative and power of the just was refuted, after the Second Synod of Orange (can. x), chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI can. xxii) in the following proposition of faith: "Si quis dixerit, justificatum . . . sine speciali auxilio Dei in accepta justitia perseverare posse . . ., anathema sit." Here, also, the explanation of some difficulties will facilitate the correct interpretation of the canon. <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">Final perseverance</a>, in its most perfect sense, consists in the untarnished preservation of baptismal innocence until death. In a less strict sense it is the preservation of the state of grace from the last conversion until death. In both senses we have what is called perfect perseverance (<em>perseverantia perfecta</em>). By imperfect perseverance (<em>perseverantia imperfecta</em>) must be understood the temporary continuance in grace, e.g., for a month or a year, until the commission of the next mortal sin. We must distinguish also between passive and active perseverance, according as the justified dies in the state of grace, independently of his will, as baptized children and the insane, or actively co-operates with grace whenever the state of grace is imperilled by grievous temptations. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> had, above all, this latter case in view, since it speaks of the necessity of a special assistance (<em>auxilium speciale</em>), which can designate nothing else but an <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a> or rather a whole series of these. This "special grace" is, consequently, not conferred with the possesion of sanctifying grace, nor is it to be confounded with ordinary graces, nor finally to be looked upon as a result of the mere power of perseverance (<em>posse perseverare</em>). Hence, as a new and special grace, it ultimately is but a continuous series of efficacious (not merely sufficient) graces combined with a particular external protection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> against fall into sin and with the final experience of a happy death. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, can. xvi) is therefore justified in speaking of it as a great gift --"magnum donum". The Bible extols <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">final perseverance</a>, now as a special grace not included in the bare notion of justification (Phil., i, 6; <a href="../bible/1pe001.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>), now as the precious fruit of special prayer (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs41">Matthew 26:41</a>; <a href="../bible/joh017.htm">John 17:11</a>; <a href="../bible/col004.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>). Augustine (De dono persev., c. iii) used the necessity of such prayer as a basis of argumentation, but added, for the consolation of the faithful, that, while this great grace could not be merited by good works, it could by persevering genuine prayer be obtained with infallible certainty. Hence the practice of pious <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to pray daily for a good death can never be too earnestly commended.
<h3 id="B">The gratuity of actual grace</h3>

<p>Beside the necessity of <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, its absolute gratuity stands out as the second fundamental question in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> on this subject. The very name of <em>grace</em> excludes the notion of merit. But the gratuity of specifically Christian grace is so great and of such a superior character that even mere natural petition for grace or positive natural dispositions cannot determine <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the bestowal of his supernatural assistance. A mere negative preparation or mere negative dispositions, on the contrary, which consist only in the natural removal of obstacles, are in all probability not essentially opposed to gratuity. Owing to its gratuitous character, grace cannot be earned by strictly natural merit either in strict justice (<em>meritum de condigno</em>) or as a matter of fitness (<em>meritum de congruo</em>). But is not this assertion in conflict with the dogma that the just man can, through supernatural works, merit <em>de condigno</em> an increase in the state of grace and eternal glory, just as the sinner can, through salutary acts, earn <em>de congruo</em> justification and all graces leading up to it? That it is not, will be clearly evident if it be remembered that the merits springing from supernatural grace are no longer natural, but supernatural (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. VI, cap. xvi). The absolute gratuity of grace is, therefore, safeguarded if it is referred to the initial grace (<em>prima gratia vocans</em>), with which the work of salvation begins, and which is preceded by pure and mere nature. For it then follows that the whole subsequent series of graces, up to justification, is not and cannot be merited any more than the initial grace. We shall now briefly examine the gratuity of grace in its several degrees as indicated above.

<p>1. The gratuitous character of grace categorically excludes real and strict natural merit with a rightful claim to just compensation as well as merit improperly so called implying a claim to reward as a matter of fitness. The meritorious character of our actions in the former sense was defended by the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, while the Semipelagians advocated it in the latter meaning. To this twofold error the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> teaching authority of the Church opposed the dogmatic declaration that the initial grace preparatory to justification is in no wise due to natural merit as a determining factor (cf. Second Synod of Orange, epilogue; Council of Trent, Sess. VI, cap. v). The categorical synodal expression, <em>nullis praecedentibus meritis</em>, wards off from grace, as a poisonous breath, not only the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> condign merit, but also the Semipelagian congruous merit. The presupposition that grace can be merited by natural deeds involves a latent contradiction. For it would be attributing to nature the power to bridge over with its own strength the chasm lying between the natural and the supernatural order. In powerfully eloquent words does Paul, in the Epistle to the Romans, declare that the vocation to the Faith was not granted to the Jews in consequence of the works of the Mosaic Law, nor to the pagans because of the observance of the natural moral law, but that the concession was entirely gratuitous. He inserts the harsh statement: "Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will; and whom he will, he hardeneth" (Rom., ix, 18). The Doctor of Grace, Augustine (De peccato orig., xxiv, 28), like a second Paul, advocates the absolute gratuity of grace, when he writes: "Non enim gratia Dei erit ullo modo nisi gratuita fuerit omni modo" (For it will not be the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> in any way unless it has been gratuitous in every way). He lays stress on the fundamental principle: "Grace does not find the merits in existence, but causes them", and substantiates it decisively thus: "Non gratia ex merito, sed meritum ex gratia. Nam si gratia ex merito, emisti, non gratis accepisti" (Not grace by merit, but merit by grace. For if grace by merit, thou hast bought, not received <em>gratis.</em>--Serm. 169, c. II). Not even <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> could be suspected of Semipelagianism, as he thought in this matter precisely like Paul and Augustine.

<p>2. While natural merit suppresses the idea of gratuity in grace, the same cannot be affirmed of natural prayer (<em>preces naturae, oratio naturalis</em>), as long as we do not ascribe to it any intrinsic right to be heard and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a duty to answer it--a right and duty which are undoubtedly implied in supernatural petitions (cf. <a href="../bible/joh016.htm">John 16:23 sq.</a>). Prayer does not, like merit, appeal to the justice or equity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to his liberality and mercy. The sphere of influence of prayer is consequently much more extensive than the power of merit. The gratuity of Christian grace is, nevertheless, to be understood so strictly that pure nature cannot obtain even the smallest grace by the most fervent prayer. Such is the doctrine asserted by the Second Synod of Orange (can. iii) against the Semipelagians. It is based on a positive Divine decree and can no longer be deduced from the intrinsic impossibility of the contrary. It is therefore permissible, without prejudice to the Faith, to adopt <a href="../cathen/13062b.htm">Ripalda's</a> opinion (De ente supernat., disp. xix, sect. 3), which holds that, in an economy of salvation different from the present, natural prayer for grace would be entitled to be heard. How little this is the case in the present dispensation is best learned from the language of the Bible. We are told that in our infirmity "we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings" (Rom. viii, 26; cf. <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs3">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>). The supernatural union with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is, moreover, represented as the indispensable condition of every successful petition (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm">John 15:7</a>). Every wholesome prayer being in itself a salutary act, it must, according to antecedent statements, spring from prevenient grace. Augustine (De dono persev. xxiii, 64) in vivid descriptions brings home to the Semipelagians their delusion in thinking that true prayer comes from us and not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who inspires it.

<p>On an almost identical level with natural prayer stand the positive preparation and dispositions to grace (<em>capacitas, sive praeparatio positiva</em>). It often occurs in human life that the positive disposition to a natural good includes in itself a certain claim to satisfaction, as, e.g. thirst of itself calls for quenching. This is still more the case when the disposition has been acquired by a positive preparation for the good in question. Thus the student has acquired by his preparation for the examination a certain claim to be sooner or later admitted to it. But how about grace? Does there exist in man a positive disposition and a claim to grace in the sense that the withholding of this expected blessing would sensibly injure and bitterly disappoint the soul? Or can man, unaided, positively dispose himself for the reception of grace, confident that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will reward his natural efforts with the bestowal of supernatural grace? Both suppositions are untenable. For, according to the express teaching of the Apostle Paul and of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, the gratuity of grace is rooted solely in the supreme freedom of the Divine will, and the nature of man possesses not even the slightest claim to grace. As a consequence, the relapse into Semipelagianism is unavoidable as soon as we seek in the positive disposition or preparation a cause for the bestowal of grace. It should be remembered, moreover, that nature is never found in its pure form, but that, from the beginning, mankind is defiled by original sin. This consideration still more forcibly puts before us the necessity of denying to sinful nature the power to draw down upon itself, like an arid region, the effusion of Divine grace, either by its natural constitution or its own endeavours.

<p>3. Negative disposition or preparation (<em>capacitas sive praeparatio negativa</em>) designates, in general, the absence or removal of obstacles which are an impediment to the introduction of a new form, as green wood is dried up to become fit for burning. The question arises, whether the requirement of such merely negative natural preparation is reconcilable with the absolute gratuity of grace. Some of the earlier Schoolmen cited in answer the celebrated much-debated axiom: <em>Facienti quod in se est, Deus non denegat gratiam</em> (To the one who does what in him lies, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not deny grace). If among the proposed interpretations of this proposition we adopt the one asserting that, in consequence of the commendable endeavours of the natural will, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not withhold from anyone the first grace of vocation, we necessarily fall into the Semipelagian heresy refuted above. In order systematically to exclude this contingency, many Schoolmen thus interpreted the axiom with <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/2109.htm#article6">Summa I-II:109:6</a>): "To the one who accomplishes what he can with the help of supernatural grace <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grants further and more powerful graces up to justification." But, interpreted in this manner the axiom offers nothing new and has nothing to do with the above-proposed question. There remains, therefore, a third interpretation: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, out of mere liberality, does not withhold His grace from the one who accomplishes what he can with his natural moral strength, i.e. from the one who, by deliberate abstention from offences, seeks to dispose <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> favourably towards him and thus prepares himself negatively for grace. Some theologians (e.g. Vasquez, Glossner) declared even this most mitigated and mildest interpretation to be Semipelagian. Most modern theological authorities, however, with Molina, Suarez, and Lessius, see in it nothing else but the expression of the truth: To the one who prepares himself negatively and places no obstacle to the ever-ready influence of grace, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in general is more inclined to offer his grace than to another who wallows in the mire of sin and thus neglects to accomplish what lies in his power. In this manner the cause of the distribution of grace is located not in the dignity of nature, but, conformably to orthodoxy, in the universal will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to save mankind
<h3 id="C">The universality of actual grace</h3>

<p>The universality of grace does not conflict with its gratuity, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in virtue of his will to save all men, distributes with sovereign liberty his graces to all adults without exception. But if the universality of grace is only a result of the Divine will to save all mankind, we must first turn our attention to the latter as the basis of the former.

<h4 id="i">God's will to save all men</h4>

<p>By the "will to save" (<em>voluntas Dei salvifica</em>) theologians understand the earnest and sincere will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to free all men from sin and lead them to <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">supernatural happiness</a>. As this will refers to human nature as such, it is a merciful will, also called "first" or "antecedent will" (<em>voluntas prima sive antecedens</em>). It is not absolute, but conditional, inasmuch as no one is saved if he does not will it or does not comply with the conditions laid down by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for salvation. The "second" or "consequent will" (<em>voluntas secunda sive consequens</em>), on the contrary, can only be absolute, i.e. a will of justice, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must simply reward or punish according as one has deserved by his works heaven or <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. We consider here solely the "antecedent will" to save; regarding the will of justice see <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">PREDESTINATlON</a>.

<p>Against the error of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> the ecclesiastical teaching authority (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. VI, can. xvii; Prop. v Jansenii damn., in Denzinger, n. 827, 1096) proclaimed in the first place the doctrine that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> seriously wills the salvation not of the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> only, but also of other men. As the Church obliged all her faithful to the recital of the passage of the creed, "Qui propter nos homines et propter nostram salutem descendit de caelis", it is also established with certainty of faith that at least all the faithful are included in the universality of salvation willed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Not to mention the touching scene in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> weeps over the impenitent Jerusalem (cf. <a href="../bible/mat023.htm#vrs37">Matthew 23:37</a>), the following is the declaration of the Saviour himself respecting believers: "For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so loved the world, as to give his only-begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm">John 3:16</a>). Far from limiting the will to save to these two classes of men, the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> and believers, theologians adhere to the theological conclusion that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without regard to original sin, wills the eternal salvation of all the posterity of Adam. The range of this will certainly extends further than the circle of believers, the eternal reprobation of many of whom is a notorious fact. For <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Pope Alexander VIII</a> (1690) condemned the proposition that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died "for all the faithful and only for them" (<em>pro omnibus et solis fidelibus.</em>--See Denzinger, n. 1294). The foreknowledge of original sin is no reason for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to except some men from his will of redemption, as the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> sect called Infralapsarians or Postlapsarians (from infra, or post, lapsum) asserted in Holland against the strictly <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> opinion of those called Supralapsarians or Antelapsarians (from <em>supra</em>, or <em>ante, lapsum.</em>--See <a href="../cathen/01740c.htm">ARMINIANISM</a>). In proof of the Catholic contention, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, cap. ii) rested on the Biblical text which exhibits the propitiatory sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as offered not only for our sins, "but also for those of the whole world" (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm">1 John 2:2</a>). We possess, besides, two classical Scriptural passages which exclude all doubt. The Book of Wisdom (xi, 24 sqq.) eulogizes in stirring language the all-exceeding mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and bases its universality on the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence of God</a> (<em>quia omnia potes</em>), on his universal domination (<em>quoniam tua sunt; diligis omnia, quae fecisti</em>), and on his love for souls (<em>qui amas animas</em>). Wherever, therefore, Divine omnipotence and domination extend, wherever immortal souls are to be found, thither also the will to grant salvation extends, so that it cannot be exclusive of any human being. After St. Paul (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs1">1 Timothy 2:1 sqq.</a>) has ordained prayers for all men and proclaimed them "acceptable in the sight of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">God our Saviour</a>, who will have all men to be saved" (<em>omnes homines vult salvos fieri</em>), he adds a threefold motivation: "For there is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and one mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>: who gave himself a redemption for all" (1. c.). Hence it is just as true that the will to grant salvation extends to all men as it is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all men, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as mediator assumed the nature of all men and redeemed them on the Cross. In regard to tradition, Passaglia, as early as 1851, brilliantly demonstrated the universality of this Divine intention from two hundred <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> and ecclesiastical writers. Augustine alone presents some difficulty. It may, however, be considered as certain to-day that the great Bishop of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> interpreted in the year 412 the Pauline text with all the other <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> in the sense of a universal will to save all men without exception and that subsequently he never explicitly retracted this view (De spir. et lit., xxiii, 58). But it is equally certain that from 421 onwards (cf. Enchir., xxvii, 103; Contr. Julian., IV, viii, 42; De corr. et grat., xv, 47) he attempted such tortuous and violent interpretations of the clear, unmistakable text that the Divine will regarding human salvation was no longer universal, but particular. The mystery can only be solved by the admission that Augustine still believed in a plurality of literal senses in the Bible (cf. Confes. XII, xvii sqq.). To avoid the necessity of imputing to the Holy Ghost the inspiration of contradictions in the same text, he conceived in his three divergent interpretations the Divine will concerning salvation as the "second" or "consequent will", which, as absolute will destining men to eternal happiness, must naturally be particular, no less than the consequent will affecting the reprobate (of. J.B. Faure, "Notae in Enchir. s. Augustini", c. 103, p. 195 sqq., Naples, 1847). The most difficult problem concerning this Divine will to save all men, a real <em>crux theologorum</em> lies in the mysterious attitude of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> towards children dying without baptism. Did <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sincerely and earnestly will the salvation also of the little ones who, without fault of their own, fail to receive the baptism of water or blood and are thus forever deprived of the beatific vision? Only a few theologians (e.g. Bellarmine, Vasquez) are bold enough to answer this question in the negative. Either invincible ignorance, as among the pagans, or the physical order of nature, as in still-births, precludes the possibility of the administration of baptism without the least culpability on the part of the children. The difficulty lies, therefore, in the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the author of the natural order, eventually declines to remove the existing obstacles by means of a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. The well-meant opinion of some theologians (Arrubal, Kilber, Mannens) that the whole and full guilt falls in all instances not on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but on men (for example, on the imprudence of the mothers), is evidently too airy an hypothesis to be entitled to consideration. The subterfuge of Klee, the writer on dogma, that self-consciousness is awakened for a short time in dying children, to render baptism of desire possible to them, is just as unsatisfactory and objectionable as Cardinal Cajetan's admission, disapproved of by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, that the prayer of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> parents, acting like a baptism of desire, saves their children for heaven. We are thus confronted with an unsolved mystery. Our ignorance of the manner does not destroy, however, the theological certainty of the fact. For the above-cited Biblical texts are of such unquestionable universality that it is impossible to exclude a priori millions of children from the Divine will to save humankind.--Cf. Bolgeni, "Stato dei bambini morti senza battesimo" (Rome, 1787); Didiot, "Ungetauft verstorbene Kinder, Dogmatische Trostbriefe" (Kempen, 1898); a. Seitz, Die Heilsnotwendigkeit der Kirche" (Freiburg, 1903), pp. 301 sqq.

<h4 id="ii">The universality of grace</h4>

<p>The universality of grace is a necessary consequence of the will to save all men. For adults this will transforms itself into the concrete Divine will to distribute "sufficient" graces; it evidently involves no obligation on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to bestow only "efficacious" graces. If it can be established, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grants to the three classes of the just, sinners, and infidels truly sufficient graces for their eternal salvation, the proof of the universality of grace will have been furnished. Without prejudice to this universality, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may either await the moment of its actual necessity before bestowing grace, or He may, even in time of need (e.g. in vehement temptation), grant immediately only the grace of prayer (<em>gratia orationis sive remote sufficiens</em>). But in the latter case he must be ever ready to confer immediate grace for action (<em>gr. operationis s. proxime sufficiens</em>), if the adult has made a faithful use of the grace of prayer.

<p>So far as the category of the just is concerned, the heretical proposition of Jansen, that "the observance of some <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments of God</a> is impossible to the just for want of grace" (see Denzinger, n. 1092), had already been exploded by the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (see Council of Trent, Sess. VI, can. xviii). In fact Holy Writ teaches concerning the just, that the yoke of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is sweet, and His burden light (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs30">Matthew 11:30</a>), that the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments of God</a> are not heavy (I John, v, 3), that "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it" (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs13">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>). These statements warrant not only the full possibility of the observance of the Divine commandments and the triumph over vehement temptation;, they virtually express simultaneously the concession of the necessary grace without which all these salutary acts are known to be absolutely impossible. It is true that in the polemical writings of some <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> and Semipelagians we read the proposition: "The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> is not granted to all." But a closer examination of the passages immediately reveals the fact that they speak of efficacious, not of sufficient, grace. This distinction is expressly stated by the anonymous writer of the fifth century whom Pope Gelasius commends as an "experienced ecclesiastical teacher" (<em>probatus ecclesiae magister</em>). In his excellent work "De vocatione gentium", he differentiates the "general" (<em>benignitas Dei generalis</em>) and the "particular" economy of grace (<em>specialis misericordia</em>), referring the former to the distribution of sufficient, the latter to that of efficacious, graces. We come to the second class, that of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sinners, among whom we reckon apostates and formal heretics, as these can hardly be placed on a par with the heathen. In their valuation of the distribution of grace, theologians distinguish somewhat sharply between ordinary sinners (among whom they include habitual and relapsing sinners) and those sinners whose intellect is blinded, and whose heart is hardened, the so-called obdurate sinners (<em>obcaecati et indurati, impaenitentes</em>). The bestowal of grace on the former group is, they say, of a higher degree of certainty than its concession to the latter, although for both the universality of sufficient grace is beyond any doubt. Not only is it said of sinners in general: "I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live" (<a href="../bible/eze033.htm#vrs11">Ezekiel 33:11</a>), and again: "The Lord . . . . dealeth patiently for your sake, not willing that any should perish, but that all should return to penance" (<a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#vrs9">2 Peter 3:9</a>), but even the obdurate and impenitent sinners are energetically summoned by the Bible to dutiful penance or at least are most vehemently are reprimanded because of their wickedness (Is. lxv 2; Rom., ii, 4; <a href="../bible/act007.htm">Acts 7:51</a>). Now where a duty of conversion exists, the necessary grace must be at hand without which no conversion is possible. For, as Augustine (De nat. et grat., xliii, n. 50) affirms: "Deus impossibilia non jubet" (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not give impossible orders). Obduracy, however, forms such a powerful obstacle to conversion that some ancient theologians embraced the untenable opinion that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> finally completely withdraws from these sinners, a withdrawal due to His mercy, which desires to save them from a more severe punishment in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. But <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> (De verit., Q. xxiv, a. 11) stated that "complete obduracy" (<em>obstinatio perfecta</em>), or absolute impossibility of conversion, begins only in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> itself "incomplete obduracy", on the contrary, ever presents on earth in the enfeebled moral affections of the heart a point of contact through which the appeal of grace may obtain entrance. Were the rigorist opinion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> complete abandonment of the obdurate correct, despair of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy would be perfectly justified in such souls. The Catholic catechism, however, presents this as a new grievous sin.

<p>The third and last question arises: Is the <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace of God</a> also conceded to the heathen? The Divine readiness to grant assistance also to the heathen (see Denzinger, n. 1295, 1379) is a certain truth confirmed by the Church against the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> Arnauld and Quesnel. To question it is to deny the above-demonstrated intention of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to save all men; for the overwhelming majority of mankind would fall outside its range. The Apostle of the Gentiles, Paul (Rom., ii, 6 sqq.), lays stress on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> impartiality towards Jews and Greeks, without "respect of persons", on the Day of Judgment, when he will reward also the Greek "that worketh good" with eternal life. The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, as <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement of Rome</a> (I ep. ad Cor. vii), Clement of Alexandria (Cohort. ad gent., 9), and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (Hom. viii in John, n. 1), do not doubt the dispensation of sufficient graces to the nations "that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death". Orosius (De arbitr. libert., n. 19), a disciple of St. Augustine, proceeds so far in his optimism as to believe in this distribution of grace "quotidie per tempora, per dies, per momenta, per <em>atoma</em> et cunctis et singulis" (daily through the seasons, through the days, through the moments, through the smallest possible divisions of time, and to all men and every man). But the clearer the fact, the more obscure the manner. In what way, one instinctively asks, did <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> provide for the salvation of the heathen? Theologians to-day generally give the following presentation of the process: It is presupposed that, according to Hebr., xi, 6, the two dogmas of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> and of future retribution must be, in all instances, believed not only, by necessity of means (<em>necessitate medii</em>), but also with explicit faith (<em>fide explicita</em>) before the process of justification can be initiated. As a consequence, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will not refrain in extraordinary cases from <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> intervention in order to save a noble-minded heathen who conscientiously observes the natural moral law. He may either, in a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> manner, depute a missionary to him (<a href="../bible/act001.htm">Acts 1:1 sqq.</a>), or teach him the revealed truth through an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> (Cardinal Toletus), or he may come to his assistance by an interior private revelation. It is clear, nevertheless, that these different ways cannot be considered as everyday ordinary means. For the multitude of heathen this assistance must be found in a universal means of salvation equally independent of wonderful events and of the preaching of <a href="../cathen/10375a.htm">Christian missionaries</a>. Some modern theologians discover it in the circumstance that the two dogmas mentioned above were already contained in the primitive supernatural revelation made in Paradise for all mankind. These truths were subsequently spread over the whole world, survive, as a meagre remnant, in the traditions of the pagan nations, and are orally transmitted from generation to generation as supernatural truths of salvation. The knowableness of these dogmas by unaided reason does not constitute an objection, for they are simultaneously natural and revealed truths. Once the condition of external preaching (cf. Rom., x, 17: "fides ex auditu") has thus been fulfilled, it only remains for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to hasten to man's assistance with his supernatural illuminating and strengthening grace and to initiate with the faith in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and retribution (which implicitly includes all else necessary for salvation) the process of justification. In this manner the attainment of the state of grace and of eternal glory becomes possible for the heathen who faithfully co-operates with the grace of vocation. However all this may be, one thing is certain: every heathen who incurs <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a> will be forced on the last day to the honest confession: "It is not for want of grace, but through my own fault that I am lost."
