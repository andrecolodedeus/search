<h1>Actus et Potentia</h1>  

<p>A technical expression in <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic</a> phraseology.

<p>I. The terms <em>actus</em> and <em>potentia</em> were used by the scholastics to translate <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> <em>energeia</em> or <em>entelecheia</em>, and <em>dynamis</em>. There is no single word in English that would be an exact rendering of either. Act, action, actuality, perfection, determination express the various meanings of <em>actus</em>; potency, potentiality, power, capacity, those of <em>potentia</em>. In general, <em>potentia</em> means an aptitude to change, to act or to be acted upon, to give or to receive some new determination. Actus means the fulfilment of such a capacity. So, <em>potentia</em> always refers to something future, which at present exists only as a germ to be evolved; <em>actus</em> denotes the corresponding complete reality. In a word, <em>potentia</em> is the determinable being, <em>actus</em> the determined being. The term <em>actus</em>, therefore, has a much greater extension than act or operation. Every operation is an <em>actus</em>, because it is the complement of a power; but all other perfections and determinations, whatever be their nature, are also <em>actus</em>. On the other hand, the being <em>in potenti&acirc;</em> is not to be identified with the possible being. The latter belongs to the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> order; it is a notion whose elements involve no contradiction. The former belongs to the real order; it exists in a subject which, though undetermined, is capable of determination. Potentia is more than a mere statement of futurity, which has reference to time only; it implies a positive aptitude to be realized in the future. It would also be a mistake to identify the scholastic <em>actus</em> and <em>potentia</em> with the actual and potential energy of physics. These terms apply only to material substances, and are exclusively dynamic; they signify the capacity for doing work, or the actual performing of work. The scholastic terms apply to all, even spiritual, beings, and refer to any reality which they possess or can acquire. The <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelian</a> "energy" (<em>actus</em>) as such, i.e., considered as actuality, can never be potential, these two terms being opposed to each other. Actuality and potentiality are mutually exclusive, since one means the presence, and the other the absence, of the same determination. Yet, in all beings except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/01125b.htm">ACTUS PURUS</a>) there is a combination of actuality and potentiality; they possess some determinations and are capable of acquiring others. Moreover, the same reality may be considered as actuality or potentiality, according as we take a retrospective or a prospective point of view. In man, skill and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> are actualities if we compare them to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which they presuppose. But if we compare them to the actions themselves, or to the actual recall of acquired <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to consciousness, they are powers, or <em>potentiae</em>. If we keep the same point of view, it is impossible for the same thing to be at the same time <em>in actu</em> and <em>in potenti&acirc;</em> with regard to the same determination.

<p><a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> explain this theory by many illustrations, one of which will suffice. The <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> exists potentially in the block of marble, because marble has an aptitude to receive the shape of a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>. This aptitude is something real in the marble, since many other substances are deprived of it. It is a receptive potentiality. With regard to the same <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> has the power, by his action, to carve the marble into the form of a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>. His is an active power, a real skill or ability which is lacking in many other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. In order to have the actual <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> (<em>actus</em>), it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> to exercise (<em>actus</em>) his real skill (<em>potentia</em>) on a substance which is not yet a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, but which has a real aptitude (<em>potentia</em>) to become one. I can form no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> either of the marble's potentiality or of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor's</a> skill unless I first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is meant by an actual <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>. In the same manner, the man born blind is unable to understand what is meant by the faculty of vision. In general, <em>potentia</em> has no meaning, and cannot be defined except through the corresponding <em>actus</em>.

<p>II. The distinction between <em>potentia</em> and <em>actus</em> is at the basis of, and pervades, the whole scholastic system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Whatever is determinable is considered as potential with regard to the actual determination. Genus and species, subject and predicate, quantity and shape, child and adult, <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, etc., are examples of potentiality and actuality. Here we must confine ourselves to the fundamental applications in <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> and in <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>. (1) In <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> the distinction runs through the ten <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelian</a> categories. All being, whether substance or <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, is either <em>in actu</em> or <em>in potenti&acirc;</em>. The essence of creatures is a potentiality with regard to their existence. Material substances are composed of primary matter and substantial form (see Matter and Form), matter being a pure potentiality, i.e., wholly undetermined, and form being the first determination given to matter. Efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> is also an application of potentiality and actuality; the cause, when at rest, remains able to act. Change is a transition from the state of potentiality to that of actuality. Generation, growth, and evolution suppose a capacity which becomes fulfilled. (2) In <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> special emphasis is laid on the reality of the <em>potentiae</em>, or <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculties</a>, and their distinction both from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and from their operations. External senses are determined or actualized by an external stimulus (see Species), which gives them the determination <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the act of perception. The internal senses (<em>sensus communis, phantasia, memoria, aestimativa</em>) depend on external sensations for their exercise. Memory and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> preserve <em>in potenti&acirc;</em> traces of past impressions, and when the proper conditions are verified the image becomes actual. We have no innate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, but in the beginning human intelligence is simply a power to acquire <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. By its operation, the active power of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (<em>intellectus agens</em>) forms the <em>species intelligibilis</em> or the determination <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the intelligence (<em>intellectus possibilis</em>) for its cognitive act. All tendency and desire is actualized by some good which one strives to acquire. In rational <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> man is conceived as one substantial being, composed of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form, united as <em>potentia</em> and <em>actus</em>.

<p>There is a tendency today in nearly all the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> towards "actuality" theories. But, if analyzed carefully, such theories will necessarily yield potential elements. In all things we find capacities for further development and evolution, forces and aptitudes which come to be utilized little by little. In scholastic terminology these are now real, but not actual. They exist only as <em>potentiae</em>, which, to manifest themselves, await the proper actualization.
