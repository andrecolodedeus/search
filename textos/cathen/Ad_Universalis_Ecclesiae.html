<h1>Ad Universalis Ecclesiae</h1>  

<p>A papal constitution dealing with the conditions for admission to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men in which solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are prescribed. It was issued by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 7 February, 1862. This Pope had issued from time to time various decrees: e.g. "Romani Pontifices" (25 January, 1848), "Regulari Disciplinae" (for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and adjacent isles, 25 January, 1848), and "Neminem Latet" (19 March, 1857). These three decrees found their completion and perfection in the constitution, "Ad Universalis Ecclesiae." It marks a distinct departure from the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> law, both as to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> age and other requirements for admission of men to solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in orders, congregations, and institutes, old and new, in which solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are prescribed. The immediate occasion of its <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> was the settlement, once and forever, of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> which had arisen and been presented to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> about the validity of solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> made without due observance of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, "Neminem Latet", i.e. without the three years' profession of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. It gives the reason of the "Neminem Latet" regulation, which was to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, congregations, and institutes from losing their genuine spirit and former excellence by hastily and imprudently admitting youths having no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vocation or of whose lives, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, bodily and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> endowments, no proper investigation had been made and no testimonial to the aforesaid had been requested of, or received from, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of their native place, or of the places where they had sojourned for the year immediately preceding their admission to the house of <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>. This the "Neminem Latet" accomplished by decreeing that <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> after the completion of their probation and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and, if <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, of the sixteenth year of their age (prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>), or of a more advanced age, if the rule of their order approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> required it, if <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, the age fixed by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> (in Suprema), should make profession of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> for the term of three full years; and after the completion of said term, to be computed from day of profession to the last hour of the third year, if found worthy, they were to be admitted to solemn profession, unless their superiors, for just and reasonable cause, postponed the solemn profession; such postponement being prohibited beyond the twenty-fifth year of age, except in the orders and countries where a longer term of simple profession was conceded by special <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The Pope says that, nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> had been admitted to solemn profession without the three years' simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, thereby giving great cause for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning the validity of said solemn profession; and a decision upon that matter was requested from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. As the "Neminem Latet" said not a word about the nullity of solemn profession made in opposition to its regulation, the solemn profession made without the prescribed three years of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> was valid, though illicit. This was decided later (S. Cong. on State of Regulars, 16 August, 1866). "We, therefore," declares <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in this constitution, <blockquote>in a matter of such great importance, desiring to remove all occasion of future <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, of Our own motion and certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and in the plenitude of Our Apostolic power as regards the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of men of whatever order, congregation, or institution in which solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are made, do determine and <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to be null and void and of no value the profession of solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, knowingly or ignorantly, in any manner, colour or pretext, made by <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> or <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, who, although they had completed the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> probation and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, had not previously made profession of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and remained in that profession for the entire three years, even though the superiors, or they, or both respectively, had the intention of admitting to, or making, solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and had used all the ceremonies prescribed for solemn profession.</blockquote>

<p>Women were not included in this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. They, unless where special <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> were granted, as in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (Bizzarri, 158), and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (Bizzarri, 463), followed the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> regulation until <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (3 May, 1902, Decretum "Perpensis", S.C. Epp. et Regul.) enjoined on them the same profession of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> for three years prior to the solemn profession, under penalty of nullity.
