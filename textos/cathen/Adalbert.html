<h1>Adalbert</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>-<a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>; born about 1000; died 1072 at Goslar; son of Count Friedrich von Goseck, and Agnes of the lineage of the Weimar Counts. He became successively canon in Halberstadt; <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> (1032); Provost of the Halberstadt Cathedral; and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> (1043 or 1045) by royal appointment, with supremacy over the Scandinavian Peninsula and a great part of the Wend lands, in addition to the territory north of the Elbe. He is probably the Adalbert mentioned as the Chancellor for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> under <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Henry III</a> in 1045. At the very outset of his episcopal career he took up the old feud of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> with the Billings, in which he had the cooperation of <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Henry III</a>. Having accompanied the Emperor on a campaign against the Liutzi (1045), he also journeyed with him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1046). Upon the settlement of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Henry</a> wished to make Adalbert Pope, but he refused, and presented his friend Suidger (<a href="../cathen/04017a.htm">Clement II</a>) as a candidate. He cooperated in the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the Wends, and three new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> were erected, all subject to Hamburg. Adalbert then conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a great northern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, with its seat at <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, but was constantly foiled. The Kings of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> and Sweden began to send their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and Sven Estrithson, King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, appealed to <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Henry</a> and <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a> for an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of his own, which would mean a loss to Hamburg of lands just yielding fruits after two hundred years of evangelization. The assent of Adalbert was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for such a decision, which he promised to ratify only on condition that his dream of a northern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> be realized. The whole discussion was cut short by the death of both Pope (1054) and Emperor (1056).

<p>During the regency of Empress Agnes, Adalbert lost his hold on the court, and the young Emperor, <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>, fell under the influence of Anno, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. Despite the ancient feud between Hamburg and Cologne, Adalbert gained control of <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Henry's</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, eventually superseding Anno in his confidence and esteem. In extenuation of Adalbert's eagerness to obtain privileges for his archdiocese it must be recalled that he had sacrificed much in the royal service, and that his influence was ever for the more open and straightforward course of action, in contradistinction to that of the opposition party. His flattery and indulgence of <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Henry</a>, however, were baneful in their effects. Forced to retire from court in 1066, by the jealousy of the nobles, he was again admitted to <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Henry's</a> councils in 1069. His ascendency over the Emperor ended only with his death (1072). Archbishop Adalbert is characterized by <a href="../cathen/01132c.htm">Adam of Bremen</a> as <em>minax vultu et habitu verborumque altitudine suspectus audientibus</em>. Generous, prudent, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> as he was, his character was marred by indomitable <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be depicted in the blackest colours.
