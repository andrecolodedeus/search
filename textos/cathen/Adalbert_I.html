<h1>Adalbert I</h1>  

<p>(Or ALBERT).

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (Mayence) 1111 to 1137. He was of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Counts of Saarbr&uuml;cken, and under both <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry V</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> he held the office of imperial chancellor, discharging his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> with energy and skill. In 1110, as head of an embassy sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to arrange for the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry V</a> as Emperor (crowned king 6 January, 1099), he had much to do with bringing about the Treaty of Sutri, in which advantage was taken of the character of <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pope Paschal II</a>, formerly <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluny</a>, who was a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">saintly</a> man, but no diplomat. A disagreement arising regarding the treaty, <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry</a> subjected the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> to a harsh <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of two months. Fearing <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, the Pope finally granted <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry</a> the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> of conferring the <a href="../cathen/13059a.htm">ring</a> and staff on <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, providing they were elected by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>, and soon after he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry</a> in St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1111). <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry</a>, according to compact, named Adalbert <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in reward for his part in the shameful intrigue against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Supreme Pontiff</a>. From the day when, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> elect, he received the insignia of his office, Adalbert become a changed man. Whether this marvellous change was due to a realization of his sacred <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> or to an awakening to the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry's</a> conduct at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, we cannot say. At any rate the ex-chancellor, lately so blindly <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the Emperor in right or wrong, became henceforth a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> and loyal defender of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. In 1112 <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry V</a> was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and Adalbert fearlessly <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a>; whereupon the enraged Emperor cast him into a dark dungeon. After three years of cruel <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> had reduced him to a mere skeleton, the people of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, rising in a body, forced <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry</a> to release him. The episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, delayed by his confinement, was then received at the hands of Otto, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> (1115). Later, when, under <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Pope Calixtus II</a>, Adalbert was made a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry</a> seized some pretext for attacking <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, whereupon Adalbert aroused the <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> princes to arms. The two armies met, but <a href="../cathen/01682b.htm">arbitration</a> prevented a battle. As a result, the Council of Worms (1122) was finally held, bringing to a close the <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">long strife regarding Investitures</a>. In 1125 <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry V</a> was on his deathbed, and being without male issue sent the imperial insignia to his wife Matilda, daughter of Henry I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The politic Adalbert, ever on the alert to ward off any danger of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, induced Matilda to return the insignia, and called an assembly of princes, who chose as <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Henry's</a> successor Lothair II the Saxon, afterwards <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Emperor in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Pope Innocent II</a> (1133). Thus the Empire passed from the house of Franconia to that of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, which had so long <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> itself loyal to the cause of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Adalbert died in 1137, having atoned for his early <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> by long years of faithful and efficient service in all that touched the interests of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
