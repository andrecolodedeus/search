<h1>Adam Contzen</h1>  

<p>Economist and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, b. in 1573 (according to Sommervogel in 1575), at Montjoie in the Dutchy of J&uuml;lich, which is now part of the Rhine province of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>; d. 19 June, 1635, at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> in 1595, was professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15720a.htm">University of W&uuml;rzburg</a> in 1606, and was transferred to the University of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1610, where he occupied the chair of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> for more than ten years. He had a share in the organization of the University of Molsheim, in Alsace, of which he was chancellor, 1622-1623. Contzen was a learned and versatile writer in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversy, in political economy, and in the interpretation of Scriptures. He defended the controversial works of Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> against the attacks of Professor Pareus of Heidelberg, and when the latter sought to unite the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Contzen demonstrated the impractical nature of the project in his work, "De unione et synodo Evangelicorum", and showed the only way of restoring peace to the German nation in his important work "De Pace Germani&aelig; libri duo, prioe de fals&acirc;, alter de ver&acirc;" (Mainz, 1616). This work was twice reprinted in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, in 1642 and in 1685. His <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> on the restoration of peace were further developed in the works occasioned by the centenary of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, one of which, Jubilum Jubilorum" was published (1618) in Latin and German. His most interesting work, which marks him as a thinker in advance of his age, "Politicorum lib. X", was published in <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1621 and 1629. The book has been called an "Anti-Macchiavelli" because the author describes the ruler of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> commonwealth in accordance with the principals of Revelation. In the questions of political and national economy which he discusses he advocates the reform of taxation, the freeing of the soil from excessive burdens, state ownership of certain industries for the purposes of revenue, indirect taxation of objects of luxury, a combination of the protective system with free trade, and state aid for popular associations. The Elector Macmillan of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> was so impressed by the ability shown in this work that he chose Contzen for his confessor. During his residence in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, which began in 1623, he completed and published his commentary on the four Gospels, and on the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> to the Romans, the Corinthians, and the Galatians. He also wrote a political novel, "Methodus doctrin&aelig; civilis, seu Abissini regis Historia", in which he showed the practical working of his political theories.
