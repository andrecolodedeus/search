<h1>Adam de Marisco</h1>  

<p>(or ADAM MARSH)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> who probably came from the county of Somerset, but the date of his birth is unknown; died at the end of 1257 or the beginning of 1258. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he acquired a great reputation. He had been for three years <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of <a href="../cathen/15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a>, in <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, when he joined the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> about 1237. He succeeded <a href="../cathen/07037a.htm">Robert Grosseteste</a> as lecturer at the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> house in <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, and soon became acquainted with many of the most distinguished men of the time. The extent and character of his correspondence shows how widespread was his personal influence, and is a striking illustration of the moral force exerted by the early <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Adam was intimate with <a href="../cathen/07037a.htm">Grosseteste</a> and Archbishop Boniface, with <a href="../cathen/13045a.htm">Richard of Cornwall</a> and Simon de Montfort. Always a reformer himself, he must have helped to give Earl Simon, who began his career in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as a foreign favourite, his deep patriotic and religious interest in the cause of reform. Over Henry III a no direct influence, but he had friends at Court and he was most anxious to combine peace and reform. Unfortunately he died just when the great political crisis of the reign was beginning. Before his death his name was proposed by Archbishop Boniface for the <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">See of Ely</a>, where there had been a disputed election, but he seems to have been opposed by the monastic interest. As a man of learning Adam had much to do with the organization of studies at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, and as "Doctor Illustris" was known throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a> professed for him the same perhaps rather excessive admiration with which he regarded <a href="../cathen/07037a.htm">Grosseteste</a>, calling them the "greatest clerks in the world". Among the works attributed to Adam are commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a>, on parts of Scripture, and on <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>.
