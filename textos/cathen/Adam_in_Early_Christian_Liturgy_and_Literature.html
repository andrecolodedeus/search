<h1>Adam in Early Christian Liturgy and Literature</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> importance to the Fathers and to the authors of the many <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings of the first five centuries of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> is clearly shown by their frequent allusions to him. His place in the liturgy is however, by no means a prominent one. His name occurs in the calendar, and in one <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, nor does he fare much better in the Western. The sections which refer to him are the first prophecy on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> and the readings of the Book of Genesis at <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a> time. In literature, on the other hand, he is more generously treated, and has become the hero of several books, such as: <em>The Book of the Penance or Combat of Adam</em> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, <em>Dictionnaire des apocryphes</em>, vol. II); <em>The Struggle of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> which they underwent after being driven out of the Garden, and during their stay in the cave of treasures, by the command of The Lord their Creator</em> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, op. cit.). The <em>Codex Nazaraeus</em> (ibid.); the <em>Testament of Adam</em>; the <em>Apocalypse of Adam</em>; the <em>Book of the Daughters of Adam</em>; the <em>Penance of Adam</em>, etc. also show to what an extent the memory of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a> was made use of in literature.

<p>The <em>Testament of Adam</em>, now consisting of merely a few fragments, is of great interest. Its precise place in the history of literature can only be determined after a study of the connection which exists between it and writings of the same or of an earlier period. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> fragments which have to do with the division of the hours of the day and night make it possible to perceive in what way Persian <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> influenced <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. Passages may be found in the <em>Apostolical Constitutions</em> of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> which seem to bear some relation to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> contained in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> fragments. The following is a translation of one of them: <blockquote> First fragment. Night hours.

<p><em>First hour:</em> This is the hour in which the demons adore; and, so long as they are adoring, they cease to do harm to man, because the hidden power of the Creator restrains them.

<p><em>Second hour:</em> This is the hour in which the fish adore, and all the reptiles that are in the sea.

<p><em>Third hour:</em> Adoration of the lower abysses, and of the light that is in the abysses, and of the lower light which man cannot fathom.

<p><em>Fourth hour:</em> Trisagion of the Seraphim. Before my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> saith Adam I heard at this hour, O my son, the noise of their wings in Paradise; for the Seraphim had gone on beating their wings, making a harmonious sound, in the temple set apart for their worship. But after my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the transgression of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> order, I ceased to hear and see them, even as was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>.

<p><em>Fifth hour:</em> Adoration of the waters that are above the heavens. At this hour, O my son Seth, we heard, I and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the noise of the great waves, lifting their voice to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because of the hidden sign of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which moves them.

<p><em>Sixth hour:</em> A gathering of clouds, and great religious awe, which veils the middle of the night.

<p><em>Seventh hour:</em> Rest of the powers, and of all natures, while the waters sleep; and at this hour, if one shall take water, let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> mix holy oil therewith, and sign with this oil those who suffer, and do not sleep; they shall be healed.

<p><em>Eighth hour:</em> Thanks given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the growth of plants and seeds, when the dew of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> falls upon them.

<p><em>Ninth hour:</em> Service of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who stand before the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p><em>Tenth hour:</em> Adoration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The gate of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> opens that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of all that lives may enter in; they prostrate themselves, and then withdraw. At this hour all that man asks of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is granted him, when the Seraphim beat their wings or the cock crows.

<p><em>Eleventh hour:</em> Great joy of all the earth when the sun rises from the paradise of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Living God</a> over all creation, and lifts itself over the universe.

<p><em>Twelfth hour:</em> Waiting and deep silence amid all the orders of light and spirits, until the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> shall have set perfumes before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then all the orders and all the powers of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> draw apart. </blockquote>

<p>There is a long and important article on the <em>Liber Adami</em> by Sylvestre de Sacy in the <em>Journal des Savants</em> for 1819-20. The book condemns continence, and prescribes marriage; allows the eating of the flesh of animals, fish, and birds. The liturgical ritual provided for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> three times a day: after sunrise, at the seventh hour, and at sunset. The Nazarenes are bound to <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> and to preaching, must <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> their children in the Jordan, and choose the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">first day of the week</a> for the ceremony.
