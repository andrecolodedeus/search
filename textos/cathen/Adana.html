<h1>Adana</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> (Asiatic Turkey). This ancient <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> colony "of willows" is situated about nineteen miles from the sea, on the right bank of the Sarus, or Seyhoun, in the heart of Cilicia Campestris. It was once a part of the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucidae</a>, and after the passing of Antiochus Epiphanes it took (171 n. C.) the name of Antioch of Sarus. Later it received from <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a> (117-138) the title of Hadriana and from <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Emperor Maximinianus</a> that of Maximiana. It has some political importance as capital of the <em>vilayet</em> or district. Adana appears in the fourth century as a see subject to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> and the patriarch of Antioch. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the Greek <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> disappeared, and is now represented in Cilicia by only one <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who styles himself <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> and Adana, and resides in the latter town. Most of his diocesans are foreigners, and come from Cappadocia or the Archipelago. They are much attached to Hellenism, and desire to be under the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Constantinople and not of Antioch. They even live in open strife with the latter, since the election (1899) of an Arabic-speaking <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> Adana, deprived of a Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, had an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> one, subject to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Sis. The first of this line known to history is a certain Stephen, who distinguished himself in 1307 and 1316. Under him a great national <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> council (the last of its kind), attended by the patriarch and the king, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the nobility, was held at Adana (1316). Thirty years earlier, in 1286, another <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> council met for forty days in Adana for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/05374b.htm">electing</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> Constantine and to dispose of several other questions. Today the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> of Adana are divided into Gregorians, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. For the Gregorians it is the centre of one of the fourteen or fifteen districts governed by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Sis; he is represented in Adana by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there is an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at Adana. As regards <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, Adana is a mission station of the Central Turkey Mission of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (about 1,000 members). The Reformed <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> Church (U.S.A.) holds it as a missionary station attended from <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>. There are, moreover, at Adana some <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> merchants and some <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> employed in various capacities. The total population amounts to about 45,000 inhabitants during the two or three months when the decortication and the cleaning of cotton attract a great many workers. During the rest of the year the population does not exceed 30,000 inhabitants, viz.: 14,000 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, 12,575 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, 3,425 Greeks, and a few others. There are in the town 18 mosques, 37 <em>medresses</em>, and 8 <em>tekkes</em>, 2 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> churches, 1 Latin church, 1 <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek church</a>, and 1 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church; 29 <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of which 28 are elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and one is secondary, 2 Greek <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and 2 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> one for boys directed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, the other for girls, under the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. The latter includes a day-school and a boarding-school.
