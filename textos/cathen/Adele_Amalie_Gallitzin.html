<h1>Adele Amalie Gallitzin</h1>  

<p>(Or GOLYZIN).

<p>Princess; b. at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 28 Aug., 1748; d. at Angelmodde, near <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, 17 April, 1806. She was the daughter of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> General Count von Schmettau, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, though she soon became estranged from her religion. In 1768, she married the Russian Prince Dimitry Alexejewitsch Gallitzin, who was under Catherine II ambassador at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> and <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">The Hague</a>. In each of these capitals, the princess, thanks to her beauty and her eminent qualities of mind and heart, played a brilliant role. At the age of twenty-four she forsook <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> suddenly and devoted herself to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of her children. She applied herself assiduously to the study of mathematics, classical philology, and philosophy under the noted <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Franz Hemsterhuis, who kindled her enthusiasm for <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socratic</a>-<a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a>, and later under the name of "Diokles" dedicated to her the "Diotima", his famous "Lettres sur l'atheisme". The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> reform introduced by <a href="../cathen/06325a.htm">Franz v. F&uuml;rstenberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of M&uuml;nster, induced her to take up her residence in the <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalian</a> capital. Here she soon became the centre of a set of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> men led by <a href="../cathen/06325a.htm">F&uuml;rstenberg</a>. This circle also included the gymnasial teachers, (whom she incited to the deeper study of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>), Overberg, the reformer of popular <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">Clemens Augustus von Droste-Vischering</a>, <a href="../cathen/14299b.htm">Count Leopold von Stolberg</a>, the profound <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Hamann, who was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in her garden. The poet Claudius of the "Wandsbecker Bote" was also a familiar visitor, and Goethe numbered the hours passed by him in this circle among his most pleasant recollections. The reading of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, necessitated by the religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of her children, and her constant intercourse with noble <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, led to her return to positive religious convictions. On 28 Aug., 1786, at the instance of Overberg, she approached the tribunal of penance for the first time in many years. Soon after she made this <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> her <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. Under his influence, she underwent a complete change which affected all her surroundings. Her <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> took on a larger growth, and produced the most admirable fruit. She became the centre of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> activity in <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>. In those <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolutionary</a> and godless times, she provided for the spread of religious writings, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a support for the religious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of many of her friends, and induced others, among them <a href="../cathen/14299b.htm">Count Stolberg</a>, to make their peace with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Her gentle charity assuaged the distress of many, and she readily and generously assisted poor and destitute <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. For extensive circles hers was a model of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and her social activity was for many a providential blessing. Portions of her correspondence and diaries were published by Scheuter (M&uuml;nster, 1874-76) in three parts. This admirable lady was the mother of the well-known American missionary <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Prince Demetrius Gallitzin</a>.
