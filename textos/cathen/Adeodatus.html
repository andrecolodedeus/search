<h1>Adeodatus</h1>  

<p>Son of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo</a>, b. 372; d. 388.

<p><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was not <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> until he was thirty-two years of age. At seventeen he contracted an illicit relation with a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and Adeodatus was born of this union. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, in his delight, named him "Adeodatus", i.e. the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">"gift of God"</a>. When <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, later, to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, this young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and the child went with him, and she and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> continued their guilty relations. The young Adeodatus was the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and hope of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and possessed of an extraordinary <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> endowment. Bound by this natural enthralment, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> would not bring himself to break from it; and as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> union was an obstacle to his receiving the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/10482a.htm">St. Monica</a>, his mother, desired him to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a> the mother of his child, feeling that then his mind would be enlightened by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Just as the name of the mother of Adeodatus has never been told, so also there has never been given the reason why she and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> did not marry at this juncture, though there was evidently some strong if not insurmountable one. Finally they separated. "She was stronger than I", wrote <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, "and made her sacrifice with a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and a generosity which I was not strong enough to imitate." She returned to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, whence she had come, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which had led her to sacrifice the object of her affection further impelled her to <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">bury</a> herself in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, where she might atone for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which had been the price so long paid for it. She left the brilliant young boy, Adeodatus, with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. Seeing the wonderful intelligence of his son, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> felt a sort of awe. "The grandeur of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> filled me with a kind of terror", he says himself (De beata vita, c. vi). <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> at the age of thirty-two from the hands of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, the intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/10482a.htm">St. Monica</a> and himself. To augment his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, Adeodatus, <a href="../cathen/01374c.htm">Alypius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine's</a> life-long associate, and a number of his closest friends, all became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> on the same occasion and received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> together. <a href="../cathen/10482a.htm">Monica</a>, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Adeodatus, who was now fifteen, and a son of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace</a>, if indeed "the child of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>", as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a> had styled him in the bitterness of self-reproach and <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a>, together with the loyal <a href="../cathen/01374c.htm">Alypius</a>, dwelt together in a villa at Cassiciacum, near <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The many conversations and investigations into <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> questions and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> made it a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">Academy</a>, of more exalted <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> than <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a>. Adeodatus had his full share in many of these learned discussions. He appears as interlocutor in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> treatise <em>De beata vita</em> (<em>puer ille minimus omnium</em> &#151; that boy, the youngest of them all), and contributed largely to the treatise <em>De Magistro</em>, written two years later. He appears to have died soon after, in his sixteenth year.
