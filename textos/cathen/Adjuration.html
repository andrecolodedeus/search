<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Adjuration</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>adjurare</em>, to swear; to affirm by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>).

<p>An urgent demand made upon another to do something, or to desist from doing something, which demand is rendered more <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> and more irresistible by coupling with it the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or of some sacred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or thing. Such, too, was the primitive use of the word. In its <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> acceptation, however, adjuration never carries with it the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, or the calling upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what is asserted. Adjuration is rather an earnest appeal, or a most stringent command requiring another to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, or not to act, under pain of divine visitation or the rupture of the sacred ties of <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">reverence</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Thus, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was silent in the house of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>, answering nothing to the things that were witnessed against Him, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a> would force Him to speak and so said to Him: "I adjure Thee by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, that Thou tell us if Thou be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>." (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs63">Matthew 26:63</a>) Adjuration may be either deprecatory or imprecatory. The one implies deference, affection, reverence, or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; the other, authority, command, or menace. The one may be addressed to any <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creature except the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>; the other can be addressed only to inferiors and the demon. In Mark (<a href="../bible/mar005.htm#vrs7">5:7</a>) the man with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">unclean spirit</a> cast himself at the feet of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> saying: "What have we to do with Thee <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of the Most High God</a>? I adjure Thee that Thou torment me not." The wretched man recognized that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was his superior, and his attitude was that of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and petition. <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>, on the contrary, fancied himself vastly superior to the Prisoner before him. He stood and commanded <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to declare Himself under pain of incurring the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of Heaven. It is hardly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to insist that one mode of adjuration is to be employed when addressing the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">Deity</a> and quite another when dealing with the powers of darkness. Helpless man, calling upon <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> to assist him, adds weight to his naked words by joining with them the persuasive names of those whose deeds and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are written in the Book of Life. No necessity is thereby laid upon the Almighty, and no constraint save that of benevolence and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But when the spirit of darkness is to be adjured, it is never allowable to address him in the language of peace and friendship. <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> must ever be approached as man's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> enemy. He must be spoken to in the language of hostility and command. Nor is there aught of <a href="../cathen/12403a.htm">presumption</a> in such treatment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one. It were indeed egregious temerity for man to cope single-handed with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, but the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, reverently invoked, carries with it an efficacy which demons are unable to withstand. Nor should it be supposed that adjuration implies disrespect for the Almighty. If it is allowable to invoke the adorable name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order to induce others to build more securely upon our world, it must be equally permissible to make use of the made means in order to impel others to action. Indeed, when used under due <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, that is "in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and in judgment", adjuration is a positive act of religion, for it presupposes on the part of the speaker <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his superintending Providence, as well as an acknowledgment that He is to be reckoned with in the manifold affairs of life. What more beautiful form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that that of the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>, wherein we beg immunity from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through the <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, the Birth, the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">Fasting</a>, the Cross, the Death and Burial, the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Holy Resurrection</a>, and the wonderful <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Second Person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself recommends this form of invocation: "Whatsoever you shall ask the Father in My name, that will I do: that the Father may be Glorified in the Son" (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs13">John 14:13</a>). Acting upon this promise, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> sends all her more solemn <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> with the adjuration: <em>Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum</em> (Through Our Lord Jesus Christ). <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> declares that the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "in My name that shall cast out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>" (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs17">Mark 16:17</a>) give all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> warrant to adjure the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This, however, must not be done out of mere curiosity, for vainglory, or for any other unworthy motive. According to <a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs12">Acts 19:12</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> was successful in casting out wicked spirits, whereas the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, using magic arts purporting to come from <a href="../cathen/14135b.htm">Solomon</a>, "attempted to invoke over them that had <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, saying: 'I conjure you by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> preaches,'" were leaped upon and overcome by those possessed, in such sort that they found it convenient "to flee out of that house, naked and wounded." In adjuring the demon one may bid him depart in the name of the Lord, or in such other language as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> may suggest; or he may drive him forth by the formal and fixed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The first manner, which is free to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, is called private adjuration. The second, which is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone, is called solemn. Solemn adjuration, or adjuration properly so called, corresponds to the Greek <em>exorkismos</em>. It properly means an expelling of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one. In the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> there are many forms of solemn adjuration. These are to be found, notably, in the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. One is pronounced over the water, another over the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, while many are pronounced over the child. Manifold and solemn as are the adjurations pronounced over the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, those uttered over the possessed are more numerous and, if possible, more solemn. This <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, with its <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, takes up thirty pages of the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>. It is, however, but rarely used, and never without the express permission of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, for there is room for no end of deception and hallucination when it is question of dealing with the unseen powers. (See <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">BAPTISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">DEVIL</a>; <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">EXORCISM</a>.)
