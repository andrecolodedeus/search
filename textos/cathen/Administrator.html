<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Administrator</h1>  

<p>The term <em>Administrator</em> in its general sense signifies a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who administers some common affairs, for a longer or shorter period, not in his own name or in virtue of the ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> attached to a certain office, but in the name and by the authority of a superior officer by whom he is delegated. In this sense vicars, and prefects-apostolic, vicars-capitular and even vicars-general are sometimes classed as administrators. In the stricter sense, however, this term is applied by modern writers to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, usually a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> and but rarely a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, to whom the provisional administration of certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs is entrusted by special <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> or episcopal appointment. Although in itself delegated, the power of an administrator may be quasi-ordinary with the right of subdelegating. Its extent depends entirely on the tenor of his commission. His <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> may extend to temporalities only, or to spiritual matters exclusively, or it may comprise both. There are three kinds of administrators who deserve special mention: (1) Administrators of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; (2) Administrators of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; (3) Administrators of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions.
<h2 id="section1">Administrators of dioceses</h2>

<p>Inasmuch as these administrators are appointed only by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, the title of Administrator Apostolic applies principally to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who are appointed directly by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, with episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to administer the affairs, temporal, or spiritual, or both, of a diocese. Their power is very nearly the same as that of vicars, and prefects-apostolic. A provicar is in fact simply an administrator apostolic. Unless it be otherwise stated in the brief of appointment, the administrator apostolic has full episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, although in its exercise he is bound by the same <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself. Thus, for instance, in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is bound to take the advice or to get the consent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors, in the same manner as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (III Pi. C. Balt., n. 22). For the event of his death, the administrator apostolic may designate in advance his own successor. His support must come from the diocese which he administers, unless otherwise provided for. While the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the administrator apostolic is similar to that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, yet his honorary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> are greatly limited. Even if he has episcopal orders, he cannot use the throne, nor the seventh <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candle</a>, nor honorary <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, although he has the right of the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>. His name is not mentioned in the canon, nor is the anniversary of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> commemorated. Administrators apostolic may be appointed in two cases: <ul> <li><em>Sede impedit&acirc;</em>; that is, when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is unable any longer to administer the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> either through infirmity, insanity, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, banishment, or because of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> or <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a>. In this case the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the administrator, though he were a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, is the same as that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who can no longer interfere in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. On the death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the administrator remains in office until recalled by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or until the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> takes charge of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; <li><em>Sede vacante</em>, when a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which has no <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter becomes vacant by the resignation, or the removal, or the death of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Where there is a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter it will in those cases elect a <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar-capitular</a> to administer the diocese. Otherwise an administrator must be chosen or appointed who will provisionally administer the diocese until confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. </ul> In missionary countries the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or vicar-apostolic may himself designate the future administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> or vicariate. If he neglects to do so, after his death an administrator is appointed by the nearest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or vicar-apostolic, or, in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and in his absence by the senior <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the province. In <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and East <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, if no provision for a provicar is made by the vicar-apostolic, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> longest in the mission becomes administrator apostolic of the vicariate. In case of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or other difficulties, the decision rests with the nearest vicar-apostolic. When a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> becomes vacant by the resignation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he may be appointed by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> administrator of the same diocese until his successor take possession of it. When a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may become administrator of the new diocese, or, if transferred to the new diocese, become administrator of the old one, until a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is appointed for the vacant see.
<h2 id="section2">Administrators of parishes</h2>

<p>Sometimes called <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> vicars, <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>, or coadjutors. They may be appointed for the same reasons as an administrator apostolic, namely, for a vacant <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, or during the lifetime of the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> or <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> who has become unfit for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, or during his absence for a longer period. Such an administrator is usually appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, with full Jurisdiction over <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> affairs and with a sufficient revenue for his support, which according to circumstances may be derived from the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, or from the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, or from both. His office and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> cease either by recall or by appointment of a new <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, when an irremovable <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> makes an appeal against his removal by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must appoint an administrator of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> until the appeal is decided by the higher authority (III P1. C. Balt., n. 286). Among these <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> administrators may be classed the so-called perpetual or permanent <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a> of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> which are under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and of which the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> or <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> is appointed not by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but by the superior of such <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. The case is far more frequent in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> than in America. The charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> is considered to be with the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> is merely the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Administrators of ecclesiastical institutions</h2>

<p>In the language of canon law, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, colleges, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, asylums, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, etc., are usually called <em>loca pia</em>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> places; that is, religious and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. Inasmuch as all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions within a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, with the exception of those privileged by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> exemption, are subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, it is evidently within his power to appoint a special or extraordinary administrator for any of these institutions, whenever he considers such a measure <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the welfare or the protection of such institution. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the institution may, under certain conditions, appeal against the appointment of such an administrator or against the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> so appointed. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> having supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all institutions within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, may appoint administrators for any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution, according to its own judgment, without recourse or appeal against its action. Administrators (executors) may also be appointed by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to take charge of certain <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests and legacies made in favour of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or for the spiritual good of her members. Although the administration of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, even those of a temporal and material nature, belongs by the constitutional law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exclusively to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, yet she often allows <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> to take part in the administration of her temporalities.
