<h1>Administrator (of Ecclesiastical Property)</h1>  

<p>One charged with the care of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. Supreme administrative authority in regard to all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> temporalities resides in the Sovereign Pontiff, in virtue of his primacy of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> power in this connection is solely administrative, as he cannot be said properly to be the owner of goods belonging either to the universal Church or to particular churches. Pontifical administrative authority is exercised principally through the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05744b.htm">Fabrica</a> of St. Peter, the Camera Apostolica, the <a href="../cathen/03217a.htm">Cardinal Camerlengo</a>, and finds frequent recognition and expression in the decrees of councils held throughout the world. In each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belongs primarily to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, subject to the superior authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. From the very beginning of the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, this power has been a part of the episcopal office (can. 37, Can. Apost., Lib. II, cap. xxv, xxvii, xxxv. Const. Apost.). On him all inferior administrators depend, unless they have secured an exemption by law, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Therefore, if an arrangement exists by which the administration of certain <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is entrusted to some members of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, nevertheless, maintains the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in supreme control with the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to direct and modify, if need be, the action taken by subordinate administrators. One of the important <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the administration of the moneys and goods belonging to his church. The Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, Tit. IX, Cap. iii, gives detailed regulations concerning the manner in which a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> is to acquit himself of this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Among other things, it is required that he shall keep an accurate record of receipts, expenditures, and <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>; that he shall prepare an inventory containing a list of all things belonging to the church, of its income and financial <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>; that one copy of this inventory shall be deposited in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and another in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> archives; that every year <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> changes shall be made in this inventory and signified to the chancellor. The authority of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is circumscribed by the general authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and by special enactments which prevent him from taking any important step without the express written permission of the ordinary.

<p>In many places <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> are called to a part in the care of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, sometimes in recognition of particular acts of generosity, more often because their cooperation with the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> will be beneficial on account of their experience in temporal matters. Although the origin of the modern <em>fabrica</em>, or board of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, is placed by some in the fourteenth and by others in the sixteenth century, the intervention of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> really goes back to very early times, since we find it referred to in councils of the seventh century. Lay administrators remain completely subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the same manner as the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The difficulties caused by the illegal pretensions of trustees in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> during the early part of the last century evoked from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> a reiteration of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> regarding <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> administration notably in a brief of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> (12 August, 1841) wherein the Pope declared anew that the right of such inferior administrators depends entirely on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and that they can do only what the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has empowered them to do. In some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> where the system of administration by lay trustees is in vogue the regulations and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are made a part of the bylaws of church corporations, a measure which is of great advantage in case of a process before the secular courts. The administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belonging to religious institutes under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ordinary rests naturally with their superiors, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may reserve to himself in the constitutions a large right of control and supervision. In reference to institutes under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> right is limited to signing the report sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> every third year by the superior. Religious orders are exempt from <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> control in the administration of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but are bound, when engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work, to present to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> a report of the amounts they have received for <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> purposes, and of the use made of such contributions. The exclusive <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> in the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> have been denied in practice by <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>, often with the result of serious <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and hardship to particular churches especially during the last two centuries. Hence the care taken in various councils to admonish administrators to secure the titles to <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> in accordance with the provisions of secular law, e.g. III Plen. Balt., no. 266.
