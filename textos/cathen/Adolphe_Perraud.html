<h1>Adolphe Perraud</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and academician; b. at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 7 Feb., 1828; d. 18 Feb., 1906. He had a brilliant career at the lyc&eacute;es Henri IV and St. Louis, and entered the Ecole Normale, where he was strongly influenced by <a href="../cathen/06731b.htm">Gratry</a>. In 1850 he secured the fellowship of history and for two years he taught at the lyc&eacute;e of Angers. In 1852 he abandoned teaching to embrace the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> state. He returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where he joined the Oratory which was then being reorganized by <a href="../cathen/06731b.htm">Gratry</a> and Abb&eacute; P&eacute;t&eacute;tot, cur&eacute; of <a href="../cathen/13100c.htm">St. Roch</a>. On his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> in 1855 after a sojourn at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was appointed professor of history and prefect of religion at the <em>petit seminaire</em> of St. L&ocirc; which had just been confided to the Oratory. At the same time he devoted himself to preaching, for which purpose he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1860 he visited <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, after which he wrote "Contemporary Ireland" (1862). In 1865 he defended a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> thesis at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, where in 1866 he became professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> and dealt brilliantly with the history of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. He was appointed (1870) by E. Ollivier a member of the Committee of Higher Education. In 1870 he was a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in <a href="../cathen/09504c.htm">MacMahon's</a> army, and after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> preached at St. Philippe du Roub and at St. Augustine. Made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> in 1874 despite his liberal tendencies, he interested himself especially in working-men. After the catastrophe of Montceau les mines, in which twenty-two miners perished, he preached the funeral sermon; he gave several <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> courses in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and preached the funerals sermons of Cardinal Guibert, <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09504c.htm">MacMahon</a>. He was actively concerned in the improvement of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> studies in which connection his sermon (1879) on "the Church and light" caused a great sensation; after the Congress of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> (1894) he was named honorary president of the Society for the Encouragement of Higher Studies among the Clergy. Elected to the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> in 1882 to replace Barbier, in 1885 he welcomed Duruy and in 1889 delivered the discourse on the prizes of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Having been superior-general of the Oratory from 1884, he resigned in 1901 in order not to sign the request for authorization of his congregation. He was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <em>in petto</em>, 16 Jan., 1893, the creation being published at the <a href="../cathen/04285a.htm">Consistory</a> of 1895. At the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1903 he energetically opposed the movement of exclusion directed against Rampolla by Puczina, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, in the name of the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government. His works consist of the "Etudes sur l'Irelande contemporaine" (Paris, 1862); "L'Oratoire de France au XVIIe si&egrave;cle" (1865); "Paroles de l'heure pr&eacute;sente" (1872); "Le Cardinalde Richelieu" (1872); also oratorical works.
