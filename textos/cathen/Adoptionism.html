<h1>Adoptionism</h1>  

<p>Adoptionism, in a broad sense, a christological theory according to which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as man, is the adoptive <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; the precise import of the word varies with the successive stages and exponents of the theory. Roughly, we have (1) the Adoptionism of Elipandus and Felix in the eighth century; (2) the Neo-Adoptionism of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> in the twelfth century; (3) the qualified Adoptionism of some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> from the fourteenth century on.
<h2 id="section1">Adoptionism of Elipandus and Felix in the eighth century</h2>

<p>This, the original form of Adoptionism, asserts a double sonship in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: one by generation and nature, and the other by adoption and grace. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is indeed the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> by generation and nature, but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as man is <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> only by adoption and grace. Hence "The Man Christ" is the adoptive and not the natural <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Such is the theory held towards the end of the eighth century by Elipandus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo, then under the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> rule, and by Felix, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a>, then under the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> dominion. The origin of this <em>Hispanicus <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a></em>, as it was called, is obscure. <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> had been a decidedly Eastern <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and we are surprised to find an offshoot of it in the most western part of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, and this so long after the parent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> had found a grave in its native land. It is, however, noteworthy that Adoptionism began in that part of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> where <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a> dominated, and where a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> colony had for years found refuge. The combined influence of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a> and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> had, no doubt, blunted the aged Elipandus's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense. Then came a certain Migetius, preaching a loose <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and holding, among other <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, that the Second Person of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a> did not exist before the Incarnation. The better to confute this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, Elipandus drew a hard and fast line between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as Man, the former being the natural, and the latter merely the adoptive <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. The reassertion of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> raised a storm of protest from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, headed by Beatus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Libana, and Etherius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11339a.htm">Osma</a>. It was to maintain his position that Elipandus deftly enlisted the co-operation of Felix of <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a>, known for his learning and versatile mind. Felix entered the contest thoughtlessly. Once in the heat of it, he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a strong ally for Elipandus, and even became the leader of the new movement called by contemporaries the <em>Haeresis Feliciana</em>. While Elipandus put an indomitable will at the service of Adoptionism, Felix gave it the support of his <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and also Punic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. From Scripture he quoted innumerable texts. In the patristic literature and Mozarabic Liturgy he found such expressions as <em>adoptio, homo adoptivus, ouios thetos</em>, supposedly applied to the Incarnation and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Nor did he neglect the aid of dialectics, remarking with subtlety that the epithet "Natural <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>" could not be predicated of "The Man Jesus", who was begotten by temporal generation; who was inferior to the Father; who was related not to the Father especially, but to the whole Trinity, the relation in questions remaining unaltered if the Father or the Holy Ghost had been incarnate instead of the Son. Elipandus's obstinacy and Felix's versatility were but the partial cause of the temporary success of Adoptionism. If that offspring of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> held sway in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> for wellnigh two decades and even made an inroad into southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> cause is to be found in <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamitic</a> rule, which practically brought to naught the control of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> over the greater part of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; and in the over-conciliatory attitude of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who, in spite of his whole-souled loyalty to the Roman Faith, could ill afford to alienate politically provinces so dearly bought. Of the two heresiarchs, Elipandus died in his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Felix, after many insincere recantations, was placed under the surveillance of Leidrad of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and gave all the signs of a genuine <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. His death would even have passed for a repentant's death if Agobar, Leidrad's successor, had not found among his papers a definite retraction of all former retractions. Adoptionism did not long outlive its authors. What <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> could not do by diplomacy and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> (Narbonne, 788; <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, 792; Frankfort, 794; Aix-la-Chapelle, 799) he accomplished by enlisting the services of missionaries like <a href="../cathen/02467a.htm">St. Benedict of Aniane</a>, who reported as early as 800 the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of 20,000 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>; and savants like <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, whose treatises "Adv. Elipandum Toletanum" and "Contra Felicem Urgellensem" will ever be a credit to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> learning.

<p>The official condemnation of Adoptionism is to be found (1) in Pope Hadrian's two letters, one to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 785, and the other to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, 794; (2) in the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/06236a.htm">Council of Frankfort</a> (794), summoned by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but "in full apostolic power" and presided over by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, therefore a <em>synodus universalis</em>, according to an expression of contemporary chroniclers. In these documents the natural divine filiation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> even as man is strongly asserted, and His adoptive filiation, at least in so far as it excludes the natural, is rejected as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. Some writers, mainly <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, have tried to erase from Adoptionism all stain of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. These writers do not seem to have caught the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> definition. Since sonship is an attribute of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and not of the nature, to posit two sons is to posit two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the very <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> exactly renders the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> when he says, "As the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> impiety divided <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> into two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> because of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, so your unlearned temerity divided Him into two sons, one natural and one adoptive" (Contra Felicem, I, P.L. CI, Col. 136). With regard to the arguments adduced by Felix in support of his theory, it may be briefly remarked that (1) such scriptural texts as <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs28">John 14:28</a>, had already been explained at the time of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> controversy, and such others as <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs29">Romans 8:29</a>, refer to our adoption, not to that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is nowhere in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> called the adopted <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; nay more, <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> attributes to "The Man Christ" all the predicates which belong to the Eternal Son (cf. <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs18">John 1:18</a>; <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs16">3:16</a>; <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs32">Romans 8:32</a>). (2) The expression <em>adoptare, adoptio</em>, used by some Fathers, has for its object the sacred Humanity, not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is said to be adopted or assumed by the Word. The concrete expression of the Mozarabic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, <em>Homo adoptatus</em>, or of some <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, <em>ouios thetos</em>, either does not apply to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or is an instance of the not infrequent use in early days of the concrete for the abstract. (3) The <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> arguments of Felix cease to have a meaning the moment it is clearly understood that, as <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> says, "Filiation properly belongs to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>". <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, by His eternal generation, remains <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, even after the Word has assumed and substantially united to Himself the sacred Humanity; Incarnation detracts no more from the eternal sonship than it does from the eternal <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of the Word. (See NESTORIANISM.)
<h2 id="section2">Neo-Adoptionism of Abelard in the twelfth century</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> left few traces in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether the christological <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> can be traced to it. They rather seem to be the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> consequence of a wrong construction put upon the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatical union</a>. <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> began to question the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of such expressions as "Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; "Christ is man". Back of what might seem a mere logomachy there is really, in <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard's</a> mind, a fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. He understood the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatical union</a> as a fusion of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, the divine and the human. And lest that fusion become a confusion, he made the sacred Humanity the external habit and adventitious instrument of the Word only, and thus denied the substantial reality of "The Man Christ" &#151; "Christus ut homo non est aliquid sed dici potest alicuius modi." It is self-evident that in such a theory the Man Christ could not be called the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Was He the adoptive <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Personally, <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> repudiated all kinship with the Adoptionists, just as they deprecated the very <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of their affiliation to the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. But after <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard's</a> theory spread beyond <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and even the Orient, the disciples were less cautious than the master. Luitolph defended at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the following proposition &#151; "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as man, is the natural <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a> and the adoptive <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>"; and Folmar, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, carried this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> tenet to its extreme consequences, denying to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as man the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to adoration. <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard's</a> new-Adoptionism was condemned, at least in its fundamental principles, by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1177: "We forbid under pain of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> that anyone in the future dare assert that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as man is not a substantial reality (<em>non esse aliquid</em>) because as He is truly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so He is verily man." The refutation of this new form of Adoptionism, as it rests altogether on the interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatical union</a>, will be found in the treatment of that word. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">HYPOSTATIC UNION</a>.)
<h2 id="section3">Qualified adoptionism of later theologians</h2>

<p>The formulas "natural <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>", "adopted <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>" were again subjected to a close analysis by such <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> as <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> (1300); <a href="../cathen/05208a.htm">Durandus a S. Portiano</a> (1320); <a href="../cathen/15275a.htm">Vasquez</a> (1604); Francisco Su&aacute;rez (1617). They all admitted the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, and confessed that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as man was the natural and not merely the adoptive <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But besides that natural sonship resting upon the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatical union</a>, they thought there was room for a second filiation, resting on grace, the grace of union <em>(gratia unionis</em>). They did not agree, however, in qualifying that second filiation. Some called it adoptive, because of its analogy with our <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> adoption. Others, fearing lest the implication of the word adoption might make <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> a stranger to, and alien from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, preferred to call it natural. None of these theories runs counter to a defined <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>; yet, since sonship is an attribute of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, there is danger of multiplying the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by multiplying the filiations in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. A second natural filiation is not intelligible. A second adoptive filiation does not sufficiently eschew the connotation of adoption as defined by the <a href="../cathen/06236a.htm">Council of Frankfort</a>. "We call adoptive him who is stranger to the adopter." The common mistake of these novel theories, a mistake already made by the old Adoptionists and by <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, lies in the supposition that the grace of union in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not being less fruitful than habitual grace in man, should have a similar effect, viz., filiation. Less fruitful it is not, and yet it cannot have the same effect in Him as in us, because to Him it was said: "Thou art my Son, today have I begotten Thee" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs5">Hebrews 1:5</a>); and to us, "You were afar off" (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#vrs13">Ephesians 2:13</a>).
