<h1>Adoration</h1>  

<p>In the strict sense, an act of religion offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in acknowledgment of His supreme perfection and dominion, and of the creature's dependence upon Him; in a looser sense, the reverence shown to any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or object possessing, inherently or by association, a sacred character or a high degree of moral excellence. The <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creature, looking up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom reason and revelation show to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect, cannot in right and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> maintain an attitude of indifference. That perfection which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in itself and the source and fulfilment of all the good that we possess or shall possess, we must worship, acknowledging its immensity, and submitting to its supremacy. This worship called forth by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and given exclusively to Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is designated by the Greek name <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm"><em>latreia</em></a> (latinized, <em>latria</em>), for which the best translation that our language affords is the word <em>Adoration.</em> Adoration differs from other acts of worship, such as supplication, confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, etc., inasmuch as it formally consists in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">self-abasement</a> before the Infinite, and in devout recognition of His transcendent excellence. An admirable example of adoration is given in the <a href="../bible/rev007.htm#vrs11">Apocalypse 7:11-12</a>: "And all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> stood round about the throne, and about the ancients, and about the living creatures; and they fell before the throne upon their faces, and adored <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Benediction and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and power, and strength to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. forever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." The revealed precept to adore god was spoken to Moses upon Sinai and reaffirmed in the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> thou shalt adore, and Him only shalt thou serve" (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs10">Matthew 4:10</a>).

<p>The primary and fundamental element in adoration is an interior act of mind and will; the mind perceiving that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> perfection is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, the will bidding us to extol and worship this perfection. Without some measure of this interior adoration "in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" it is evident that any outward show of divine worship would be mere pantomime and falsehood. But equally evident is that the adoration felt within will seek outward expression. Human nature demands physical utterance of some sort for its spiritual and emotional moods; and it is to this <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> for self-expression that our whole apparatus of speech and gesture is due. To Suppress this <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> in religion would be as unreasonable as to repress it in any other province of our experience. Moreover, it would do religious grievous harm to check its tendency to outward manifestation, since the external expression reacts upon the interior sentiment, quickening, strengthening, and sustaining it. As St Thomas teaches: "it is connatural for us to pass from the physical signs to the spiritual basis upon which they rest" (Summa II-II:48:2). It is to be expected, then, that men should have agreed upon certain conventional actions as expressing adoration of the Supreme Being. Of these actions, one has pre-eminently and exclusively signified adoration, and that is sacrifice. Other acts have been widely used for the same purpose, but most of them &#151; sacrifice always excepted &#151; have not been exclusively reserved for Divine worship; they have also been employed to manifest friendship, or reverence for high personages. Thus Abram "fell flat on his face" before the Lord (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm#vrs3">Genesis 17:3</a>). This was clearly an act of adoration in its highest sense; yet that it could have other meaning, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from, e.g., <a href="../bible/1sa020.htm#vrs41">1 Samuel 20:41</a>, which says that <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> adored "falling on his face to the ground" before Jonathan, who had come to warn him of Saul's <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. In like manner Gen xxxi; 3 narrates that Jacob, on meeting his brother Esau "bowed down with he face to the ground seven times". We read of other forms of adoration among the Hebrews, such as taking off the shoes (<a href="../bible/exo003.htm#vrs5">Exodus 3:5</a>), bowing (<a href="../bible/gen024.htm#vrs26">Genesis 24:26</a>), and we are told that the contrite <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> stood when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> when he worshipped with the elders of Ephesus. Among the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> it was common to adore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, standing with outstretched arms and facing the east. Finally, we ought perhaps to mention the act of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> adoration which seems to contain the etymological explanation of our word adoration. The word <em>adoratio</em> very probably originated from the phrase <em>(manum) ad os (mittere)</em>, which designated the act of <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> the hand to the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the god one wished to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Concerning the verbal manifestation of adoration &#151; that is, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of praise - explanation is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The connection between our inner feelings and their articulate utterance is obvious.

<p>Thus far we have spoken of the worship given directly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect Being. It is clear that adoration in this sense can be offered to no finite object. Still, the impulse that leads us to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> perfection in itself will move us also to venerate the traces and bestowals of that perfection as it appears conspicuously in saintly men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Even to inanimate objects, which for one reason or another strikingly recall the excellence, majesty, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, or mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we naturally pay some measure of reverence. The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> which these creatures possess by participation or association is a reflection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>; by honouring them in the proper way we offer tribute to the Giver of all good. He is the ultimate end of our worship in such cases as He is the source of the derived perfection which called it forth. But, as was intimated above, whenever the immediate object of our veneration is a creature of this sort, the mode of worship which we exhibit towards it is fundamentally different from the worship which belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm"><em>Latria</em></a>, as we have already said, is the name of this latter worship; and for the secondary kind, evoked by <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, we use the term <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm"><em>dulia.</em></a> The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, as manifesting in a sublimer manner than any other creature the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, deserves from us a higher recognition and deeper veneration than any other of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; and this peculiar cultus due to her because of her unique position in the Divine economy, is designated in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> <em>hyperdulia</em>, that is <em>dulia</em> in an eminent degree. It is unfortunate that neither our own language nor the Latin possesses in its terminology the precision of the Greek. The word <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a> is never applied in any other sense than that of the incommunicable adoration which is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. But in English the words <em>adore</em> and <em>worship</em> are still sometimes used, and in the past were commonly so used, to mean also inferior species of religious veneration and even to express admiration or affection for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> living upon the earth. So <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> "adored" Jonathan. In like manner Miphiboseth "fell on his face and worshipped" <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> (<a href="../bible/2sa009.htm#vrs6">2 Samuel 9:6</a>). Tennyson says that Enid in her <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart, adored the queen. Those who perforce adopted these modes of expression understood perfectly well what was meant by them and were in no danger of thereby encroaching upon the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Divinity. It is hardly needful to remark that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, too, even the most unlearned, are in no peril of confounding the adoration due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the religious <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> given to any finite creature even when the word <em>worship</em>, owing to the poverty of our language, is applied to both. The <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Seventh General Council</a>, in 757, puts the matter in a few words when it says that "<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <em>latria</em> is to be given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone"; and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV) makes clear the difference between invocation of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.

<p>A few words may be added in conclusion on the offences which conflict with the adoration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They may be summed up under three categories: <ul><li>worship offered to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> gods; <li>worship offered to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>, but in a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, unworthy and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> manner; and <li><a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.</ul> The first class comprises <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. The second class embraces <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. These may take manifold forms, to be treated under separate titles. Suffice it to say that vain observances which neglect the essential thing in the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and make much of purely accidental features or which bring it into contempt through fantastic and puerile excesses, are emphatically repudiated in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">Honouring</a>, or pretending to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by mystic numbers or magical phrases, as though adoration consisted chiefly in the number or the physical utterance of the phrases, belongs to the Jewish Cabbala or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> mythology, not to the worship of the Most High. (see <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">BLASPHEMY</a>; <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">IDOLATRY</a>; <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">MARY</a>; <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">SAINTS</a>; <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">WORSHIP</a>.)
