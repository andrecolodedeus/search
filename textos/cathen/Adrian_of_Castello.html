<h1>Adrian of Castello</h1>  

<p>Also called D<font size=-2>E</font> C<font size=-2>ORNETO</font> from his birthplace in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>; an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> distinguished as a statesman and reviver of learning; born about 1460, died about 1521. In 1488 he was sent by <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, but was recalled when the news of the death of James III reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. However, Adrian had arrived in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and gained the favour of Henry VII, who appointed him as his agent at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1489 he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as collector of <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's-pence</a> and in 1492 obtained the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a> of Ealdland in St. Paul's Cathedral, and the rectory of St. Dunstan-in-the-East. On the death of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he acted as a secretary in the Papal treasury and also as ambassador of Henry VII. In 1502, he was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Bishopric of Hereford</a>. In 1503 <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> raised him to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> with the title of <a href="../cathen/03742b.htm">St. Chrysogonus</a>. After the death of <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, Adrian's influence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> declined. In 1504 he was translated to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/02347b.htm">Bath and Wells</a>, but never occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. In 1509, fearing the displeasure of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, he left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and later for <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, where he remained until the death of Julius and the election of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, when he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1511). He was again, in 1517, implicated in a charge of conspiring with Cardinal Petrucci to poison the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, and confessed to having been privy to the affair. He was forgiven by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo</a>, but found it safer to escape from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. He never appeared in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> again. He had previously been deprived of his office of collector of <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's-pence</a>, and on 5 July, 1518, was <a href="../cathen/04677c.htm">degraded</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> and his Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/02347a.htm">Bath</a> given to <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a>. He was long associated with the scholar <a href="../cathen/15353c.htm">Polydore Vergil</a>, who was his sub-collector of <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's-pence</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Among his writings are a poem in elegant Latinity, entitled "Venatio" (Aldus, 1505), and treatises, "De Ver&acirc; Philosophi&acirc;" (Bologna, 1507; Cologne, 1548, Rome, 1775); and "De Sermone Latino et modo Latine loquendi" (Baste, 1513).
