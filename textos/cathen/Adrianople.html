<h1>Adrianople</h1>  

<p>A city of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. According to legend, Orestes, son of Agamemnon, built this city at the confluence of the Tonsus (Toundja) and the Ardiscus (Arda) with the Hebrus (Maritza). The <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a> developed it, adorned it with monuments, changed its name of Orestias to Hadrianopolis, and made it the capital of the province of Haemimont, or Thrace. Licinius was defeated there by Constantine in 323, and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> killed by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> in 378. During the existence of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, Theodore, Despot of Epirus, took possession of it in 1227, and two years later was killed there by As&ecirc;n, King of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>. It was captured by Ainurat I in 1360, and it was the capital of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> from 1362 to 1453. It was occupied by the Russians in 1829, during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for Grecian independence, and in 1878, in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> independence. Adrianople is today the principal city of a vilayet (province) of the same name, which has about 960,000 inhabitants. It has a thriving commerce in woven stuffs, silks, carpets, and agricultural products. Adrianople contains the ruins of the ancient palace of the Sultans, and has many beautiful mosques, the most remarkable being that of Selim II, of an altogether grandiose appearance and with a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> three or four feet higher than that of St. Sophia. The city suffered greatly in 1905, from a conflagration. It then possessed about 80,000 inhabitants, of whom 30,000 were <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. (Turks and some Albanians, Tzigani, and Circassians); 22,000 Greeks, or those speaking Greek; 10,000 <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>; 4;000 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>; 12,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; 2,000 not classifiable. The see of a Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and of a Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Adrianople is also the centre of a <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> diocese, but it is not recognized and is deprived of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The city also has some <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, foreigners for the most part, and not numerous, are dependents of the vicariate-apostolic of Constantinople. At Adrianople itself there are the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a> (Minors Conventual) and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls conducted by the Sisters of Charity of <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Agram</a>. In the suburb of Kara-Aghatch there are a church (Minor <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>), a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys (Assumptionists), and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls (Oblates of the Assumption). Each of its mission stations, at Rodosto and D&eacute;d&eacute;-Aghatch, has a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (Minor <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>), and there is one at <a href="../cathen/03183c.htm">Gallipoli</a> (the <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>). From the standpoint of the Oriental <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Adrianople is the residence of a <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> vicar-apostolic for the Uniats of the vilayet (province) of Thrace and of the principality of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>. There are 4,600 of them. They have 18 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or missions, 6 of which are in the principality, with 20 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 31 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom 6 are <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a> and 6 are Resurrectionists; 11 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 670 pupils. In Adrianople itself there are only a very few United <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, with an Episcopal <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Elias, and the churches of <a href="../cathen/04706b.htm">St. Demetrius</a> and Sts. Cyril and Methodius. The last is served by the Resurrectionists, who have also a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of 90 pupils. In the suburb of Kara-Aghatch, the <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a> have a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 50 pupils. Besides the United <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, the above statistics include the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions of Malgara and Daoudili, with 4 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 200 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, because from the civil point of view they belong to the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Vicariate.
