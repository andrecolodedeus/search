<h1>Adrien Baillet</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> author, b. 1649 at Neuville en Hez, near <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1706. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were poor, but the Cordeliers of La Garde, struck by the boy's <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and alertness of mind, took him into their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and then had him admitted to the College of Beauvais, where, at the close of his studies, he became teacher of humanities. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1676, he served for a time as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of Lardieu and was then made canon of Beaumont, but neither pastoral nor canonical functions satisfied him. At the end of four years his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of learning took him to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he secured the place of librarian to the celebrated <a href="../cathen/08766a.htm">de Lamoignon</a>. An insatiable reader and a rigid ascetic, he spent his life in the seclusion of study and austerity. In a comparatively short time he had made an analytical catalogue, in thirty-two folios, of <a href="../cathen/08766a.htm">Lamoignon's</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. The great mass of erudition thus acquired soon passed into innumerable books. His writings may be divided into three groups: (1) Erudition, (2) History, (3) Religion. To the first group belong: "Jugements des savants sur les priucipaux ouvrages des auteurs" (1685); "Des auteurs d&eacute;guis&eacute;s" (1690); "Des enfants c&eacute;l&egrave;bres" (1688). With the exception of the last, which still attracts by its curiousness, these books are now almost forgotten, both because they are incomplete and because they have been more than replaced by the works of such writers as Brunet, Querard, Barbier, etc. Baillet's criticisms were not accepted by all. M&eacute;nage, who thought himself ill-treated, wrote the "Anti-Baillet" to which Baillet replied by "Des satires personnelles" (1682). La Monnoie published a revised edition of all the foregoing books, to which he joined by way of introduction an "Abr&eacute;g&eacute; de la vie de M. Baillet" (Paris, 1722; Amsterdam, 1725).

<p>To the second group belong: "Histoirede Hollande" (1690); "Vie de Descartes" (1692); "Vie de Godefroy Hermant"; "Vie de Richer" (1693); "Histoire des d&eacute;m&ecirc;l&eacute;s du Pape Boniface VIII avec Philippe le Bel" (1718), etc. The author shows too much sympathy for the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> Hermant and the Gallican Richer. His life of <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> is replete with interesting but rather garbled information. <a href="../cathen/09142b.htm">Lelong</a> thought so well of the "History of the Conflict between Boniface VIII and Philippe le Bel" that he edited it (Paris, 1718).

<p>To the third and by far the most important group belong: "D&eacute;votion &agrave; la Vierge et le culte qui lui est d&ucirc;" (Paris 1694: Tournai, 1712). The avowed purpose of this book is to clear Mariology from indiscreet devotions, but Baillet clearly overreaches himself by bluntly denying the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of Mary and by attacking devotions sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The book was put on the "Index Expurgatorius" donec corrigatur in 1694 and 1701. The erudition displayed in "Les vies des saints, compos&eacute;es sur ce qul nous est rest&eacute; de plus authentique et de plus assur&eacute; dans leur histoire" (Paris 1701 and 1794) is prodigious, yet the greater part of it (from January to August) was put on the Index in 1707 and 1711. The cause of that condemnation is the hypercritical spirit evinced throughout in the "Vie des Saints". While aiming at doing away with unauthenticated <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, Baillet comes very near casting <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on all <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> manifestations. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (De festis, II, xvi, 8) calls him a man with an intemperate mind and an ever-ready disposition to impeach even the best attested facts. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> Stilting (Acta SS., V, 458, 488) says of him, apropos of <a href="../cathen/09376a.htm">Bl. Louis Allemand</a>: "I deem it unnecessary to refute a man who, I find, stumbles at nearly every step". Other <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> reproach him for not keeping the rules he had so well laid down in his "Jugements", and find him frequently at fault, now by excess of criticism, now by excess of credulity. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> is almost the only ancient historian who finds favour with Baillet. All the other writers of <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiology</a> are held by him in suspicion and almost in contempt. That frame of mind could not yield good results. "Some French critics in sacred biography", says Alban Butler, in the introduction to his "Lives of the Saints", "have tinctured their work with a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and pernicious leaven, and, under the name of criticism, established scepticism". That sentence applies in a measure to Baillet. His contemporaries were not mistaken as to the origin of that pernicious leaven. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06378a.htm">Gap</a>, Berger de Malissoles, in prohibiting the work in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, wrote: "That book on a great many points of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and discipline savours the sentiments not only of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Janseni</a> but also of the so-called reformers".
