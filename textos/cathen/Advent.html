<h1>Advent</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>ad-venio</em>, to come to).

<p>According to present [1907] usage, Advent is a period beginning with the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> nearest to the feast of <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">St. Andrew the Apostle</a> (30 November) and embracing four Sundays. The first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> may be as early as 27 November, and then Advent has twenty-eight days, or as late as 3 December, giving the season only twenty-one days.

<p>With Advent the ecclesiastical year begins in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western churches</a>. During this time the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are admonished

<ul> <li>to prepare themselves worthily to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">anniversary</a> of the Lord's coming into the world as the incarnate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <li>thus to make their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> fitting abodes for the Redeemer coming in <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> and through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and <li>thereby to make themselves ready for His final coming as judge, at <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">death</a> and at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>. </ul>
<h2>Symbolism</h2>

<p>To attain this object the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has arranged the Liturgy for this season. In the official <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, she calls upon her <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, in the Invitatory for <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, to adore "the Lord the King that is to come", "the Lord already near", "Him Whose glory will be seen on the morrow". As Lessons for the first <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturn</a> she prescribes chapters from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaias, who speaks in scathing terms of the ingratitude of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">house of Israel</a>, the chosen children who had forsaken and forgotten their Father; who tells of the Man of Sorrows stricken for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of His people; who describes accurately the passion and death of the coming <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> and His final glory; who announces the gathering of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to the Holy Hill. In the second <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturn</a> the Lessons on three <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> are taken from the eighth <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope St. Leo</a> (440-461) on <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> as a preparation for the advent of the Lord, and on one Sunday (the second) from <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> commentary on <a href="../bible/isa011.htm#vrs1">Isaiah 11:1</a>, which text he interprets of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> as "the rod out of the root of Jesse". In the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of the season we find praise for the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, as Redeemer, combined with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to the coming judge of the world to protect us from the enemy. Similar <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are expressed in the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> for the Magnificat on the last seven days before the Vigil of the Nativity. In them, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> calls on the Divine Wisdom to teach us the way of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; on the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">Key of David</a> to free us from bondage; on the Rising Sun to illuminate us sitting in darkness and the shadow of death, etc. In the Masses the intention of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is shown in the choice of the Epistles and Gospels. In the Epistle she exhorts the faithful that, since the Redeemer is nearer, they should cast aside the works of darkness and put on the armour of light; should walk honestly, as in the day, and put on the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>; she shows that the nations are called to praise the name of the Lord; she asks them to rejoice in the nearness of the Lord, so that the price of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which surpasses all understanding, may keep their hearts and minds in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>; she admonishes them not to pass judgment, for the Lord, when He comes, will manifest the secrets hidden in hearts. In the Gospels the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> speaks of the Lord coming in glory; of Him in, and through, Whom the prophecies are being fulfilled; of the Eternal walking in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; of the voice in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord". The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in her Liturgy takes us in spirit back to the time before the incarnation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as though it were really yet to take place. <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> says:

<blockquote><p>We are not dryly exhorted to profit by that blessed event, but we are daily made to sigh with the Fathers of old, "Send down the dew, ye heavens, from above, and let the clouds rain the Just One: let the earth be opened, and bud forth the Redeemer." The Collects on three of the four <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> of that season begin with the words, "Lord, raise up thy power and come" &#151; as though we feared our iniquities would prevent His being born. </p></blockquote>
<h2>Duration and ritual</h2>

<p>On every day of Advent the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> of the Sunday or Feria must be said, or at least a Commemoration must be made of them, no matter what grade of feast occurs. In the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> the <em>Te Deum</em>, the joyful <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of praise and thanksgiving, is omitted; in the Mass the <em>Gloria in excelsis</em> is not said. The <em>Alleluia</em>, however, is retained. During this time the solemnization of matrimony (<a href="../cathen/10005a.htm">Nuptial Mass</a> and Benediction) cannot take place; which prohibition binds to the feast of Epiphany inclusively. The celebrant and sacred <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> use violet vestments. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at Mass, in place of the <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatics</a> commonly used, wear folded <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasubles</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> removes his during the reading of the Epistle, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> exchanges his for another, or for a wider stole, worn over the left shoulder during the time between the singing of the Gospel and the Communion. An exception is made for the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> (<em>Gaudete</em> Sunday), on which the vestments may be rose-coloured, or richer violet ones; the sacred <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> may on this Sunday wear <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatics</a>, which may also be used on the Vigil of the Nativity, even if it be the fourth <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of Advent. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> (1198-1216) states that black was the colour to be used during Advent, but violet had already come into use for this season at the end of the thirteenth century. <a href="../cathen/02570c.htm">Binterim</a> says that there was also a law that pictures should be covered during Advent. Flowers and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Saints are not to be placed on the altars during the Office and Masses of this time, except on the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a>; and the same prohibition and exception exist in regard to the use of the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a>. The popular <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the four weeks of Advent symbolize the four thousand years of darkness in which the world was enveloped before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> finds no confirmation in the Liturgy.
<h2>Historical origin</h2>

<p>It cannot be determined with any degree of <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> when the celebration of Advent was first introduced into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The preparation for the feast of the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Nativity of Our Lord</a> was not held before the feast itself existed, and of this we find no evidence before the end of the fourth century, when, according to Duchesne [Christian Worship (London, 1904), 260], it was celebrated throughout the whole Church, by some on 25 December, by others on 6 January. Of such a preparation we read in the Acts of a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at Saragossa in 380, whose fourth canon prescribes that from the seventeenth of December to the feast of the Epiphany no one should be permitted to absent himself from church. We have two <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of <a href="../cathen/10081a.htm">St. Maximus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> (415-466), entitled "In Adventu Domini", but he makes no reference to a special time. The title may be the addition of a copyist. There are some <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> extant, most likely of <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">St. Caesarius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles (502-542), in which we find mention of a preparation before the birthday of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; still, to judge from the context, no general law on the matter seems then to have been in existence. A <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held (581) at <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, by its ninth canon orders that from the eleventh of November to the Nativity the Sacrifice be offered according to the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> rite on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of the week. The Gelasian Sacramentary notes five <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> for the season; these five were reduced to four by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope St. Gregory VII</a> (1073-85). The collection of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (590-604) begins with a sermon for the second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of Advent. In 650 Advent was celebrated in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> with five <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> had made <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> about <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> to be observed during this time, some beginning with the eleventh of November, others the fifteenth, and others as early as the autumnal equinox. Other <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> forbade the celebration of matrimony. In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> we find no documents for the observance of Advent earlier than the eighth century. St. Theodore the Studite (d. 826), who speaks of the feasts and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> commonly celebrated by the Greeks, makes no mention of this season. In the eighth century we find it observed not as a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> celebration, but as a time of fast and abstinence, from 15 November to the Nativity, which, according to Goar, was later reduced to seven days. But a council of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> (1720) ordered the fast according to the old rule from the fifteenth of November. This is the rule with at least some of the Greeks. Similarly, the Ambrosian and the Mozarabic Riterites have no special liturgy for Advent, but only the fast.
