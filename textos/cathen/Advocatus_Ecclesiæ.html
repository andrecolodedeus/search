<h1>Advocatus Ecclesi&aelig;</h1>  

<p>A name applied, in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, to certain <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay persons</a>, generally of noble birth, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was, under given conditions, to represent a particular church or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and to defend its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> against force. These advocates were specially bound to represent their clients before the secular courts. They exercised <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> in the domain. of the church or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and were bound to protect the church with arms in the event of actual assault. Finally, it was their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to lead the men-at-arms in the name of the church or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and to command them in time of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. In return for these services the advocate received certain definite revenues from the possessions of the church, in the form of supplies or services, which he could demand, or in the form of a lien on the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. Such advocates are to be found even in Roman times; a <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Synod of Carthage</a> decreed, in 401, that the emperor should be requested to provide, in conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <em>defensores</em> for the churches (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, <em>Conciliengeschichte</em>, 2d ed., I, 83). There is evidence, moreover, for such <em>defensores ecclesi&aelig;</em> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, at the close of the fifth century. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a>, however, confined the office to members of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It was the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of these <em>defensores</em> to protect the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and to defend the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and possessions of the church. In the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom, and under the Carlovingians, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the church advocate were enlarged and defined according to the principles of government which prevailed in the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; henceforward we meet with the <em>advocatus ecclesi&aelig;</em> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> sense. A Capitulary of about 790 (Mon-Germ. Hist., Cap. Reg. Francor., I, 201) ordained that the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, "for the sake of the churches <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and the respect due to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>" (<em>pro ecclesiastico honore, et pro sacerdotum reverentia</em>) should have advocates. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and abbesses to maintain <em>advocati</em>, commanded that great care should be exercised in the choice of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to fill the office; they must be judicious men, familiar with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and owning <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in the county (<em>Grafschaft</em>.--See Capitulary of 802, and 801-13, 1. c. I, 93, 172). The churches, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a>, as such, alike received advocates, who by degrees assumed the position above defined. In the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> the king had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to appoint the advocates, but many <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions obtained the right of election. The office was not, at first, hereditary, nor even for life; in the post-Carlovingian period, however, it developed into an hereditary one, and was held by powerful nobles, who constantly endeavoured to enlarge their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in connection with the church or the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Conciliar decrees were passed as early as the ninth century to protect <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions against the excessive claims of their advocates, who, indeed, grew to be in many ways a heavy burden to their clients. They dealt with the possessions entrusted to them as with their own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, plundered the church estate, appropriated the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and other revenues, and oppressed in every possible way those whom they were appointed to protect. The office, since it offered many advantages, was eagerly sought after. The excessive claims of the advocates gave rise to many disputes between them and the churches or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, who found their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> seriously curtailed, appealed to the emperor and to the Pope for protection. In the twelfth century grave warnings issued from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, restraining the high-handed actions of the advocates under pain of severe <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties, which did not, however, put an end to all the abuses that prevailed. On certain occasions, emperors and princes exercised the office of advocate, in which case they appointed deputy-advocates (<em>subadvocati</em>) to represent them.
