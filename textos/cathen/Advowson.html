<h1>Advowson</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <em>advocatio</em>; Old <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French</a>, <em>avo&euml;son</em>).

<p>In English law the right of patronage of a church or <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a>, a right exercised by <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> to such church or other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. English law recognizes two kinds of advowsons, presentative and collative. Until the year 1898 there was also a third kind, known as advowson donative.

<p>I. In the very early Saxon period <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were coterminous, each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> residing with his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at his Cathedral church. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> went forth to distant regions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, preaching and administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But all <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and oblations were brought into a common fund for support of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, repair of churches and other works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and devotion. In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> churches arose, in some places through the liberality of the inhabitants, in other places by the action of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves. By the eighth century, it is said, great lords, such as the lords of manors, had begun to build and endow churches for the use of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> and tenants, or friends. Bishops would permit the founder of a church to nominate its resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; and, moreover, consented that, contrary to the ancient custom, the use of its income should be restricted to such a church. But as the Bishop's permission was required for the erection of a church, he had to pronounce upon the sufficiency of its endowment <em>unde digne domus Dei sustentaretur</em> (that the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should thereby be worthily supported), and the nominee was to be presented to him and approved of by him. The <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> constituted an advowson presentative. In those rude ages there followed on this right to nominate, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to defend, to become <em>advocatus</em> or advowee, champion or protector of the church of which the patron had named the incumbent. About the year 800 these lay foundations had become common. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were often vested with advowsons by act of their founders or benefactors. After the Norman conquest, French or Norman <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> might hold the advowsons of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. And when at the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were suppressed their advowsons passed with their estates to the lay beneficiaries of the suppression.

<p>II. Advowsons donative were recognized by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> until 1898. A statute of that year made all such advowsons presentative. The owner of an advowson donative possessed by law extraordinary privileges. His right of patronage was exercised without presentation of his nominee to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The latter had not, as in advowsons presentative, the right of institution; that is, the right of conveying or committing the cure to the incumbent; nor the right of induction; that is, of issuing a mandate inducting the incumbent into possession of the church, with its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and profits. The patron had sole right of visitation, and sole <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to deprive the incumbent, and to the patron any resignation of the charge was to be made.

<p>III. An advowson collative is an advowson held by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; who is said to confer the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> "by the one act of collation", remarks Sir William Blackstone. For, the same authority explains, as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot present to himself, he does, by this one act, "the whole that is done in common cases by both presentation and institution" (Commentaries, II, iii, 22). Advowsons began to be regarded as a kind of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> at about the period of the Norman conquest. From the spiritual point of view an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> preferment was a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>, with endowment for support of him to whom this spiritual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> or trust was confided, but from the English legal point of view the preferment (subject to performance of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>) was a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> enjoyed by the incumbent, who, to quote a reported law case of the year 1303, took the "great <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, small <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, oblations, obventions, and other kind of issues." (See Year Books of the reign of King Edward the First, ed. and tr. by Alfred J. Horwood, London, 1863, 31 Edward I, 338.)

<p>English law rejected the view that presentation was "a personal, Spiritual trust" (Mirehouse v. Rennell, 8 Bingham's Reports, 490, p. 491), admitting the object of the advowson to be of a spiritual nature, but holding the advowson to be a temporal estate of inheritance with presentation as its mode of enjoyment, profit or rent. The canonical qualifications of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> nominated are to be passed upon by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the instance of a lay advowson presentative. But the exercise of the right of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> is subject to the King's Courts only. Writs even of the reign of King Henry the Second (1154-89) recited "lites de Advocationibus ecclesiarum ad Coronam et dignitatem meam pertinent." And after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the king was declared by law to be "the supreme <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority." As to <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>; "The incorrupt exercise of the trust is secured," remarks an English judge, "by the penalties against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, and the selection of a fit clerk by the <a href="../cathen/05673a.htm">examination</a> of the ordinary", (See 8 Bingham's Reports, 527.) Dr. Samuel Johnson expresses what had doubtless become the rule as to this examination when he states that "the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has no power to reject a man nominated by the patron, but for some crime that might exclude him from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>." (Boswell; Life of Johnson, ed. G. B. Hill, Oxford, 1887, II, 243.)

<p>An advowson, regarded by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> as <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, is termed an incorporeal hereditament, "a right issuing out of a thing corporate." It is a marketable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, which may be granted by deed or will, which passes by a grant of all lands and tenements, and which may, therefore, become the subject of litigation. Blackstone, extolling King Edward the First as "our English <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a>", mentions among the king's achievements his having "effectually provided for the recovery of advowsons as temporal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>" (Commentaries, IV, xxxiii, 425, 426). And in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> reports of this king's reign we find a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sued by a prior whose nominee the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had refused, pleading that the prior's nominee was not suitable for reasons which are specified to the court, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> thus seeming to submit (at least, to some extent) the propriety of his acts to the court's judgment. (See Year Books already cited. 32 Edward I, 30, 1304.)

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> which, originally, was conferred on a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> building or endowing a church, appears to have become, by degrees, "appendant to the manor in which it was built" (8 Bingham's Reports, 491), and, therefore, termed an advowson appendant. And the boundaries of manors became the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. But in many instances advowsons passed from owners of land to other private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or to lay or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> corporations. Advowsons thus severed from ownership of land are termed advowsons in gross. There are in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> more than 13,000 <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>; of these, in or about 1878, private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> held the advowsons of some 7,000, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, of only about 2,324, the remainder being divided among deans and chapters, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The ancient <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of protection, or championship, ceased, long since, to attach to the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a>. An advowson may apparently be held by a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, if he be owner in his own right, and not merely in an official capacity. But no <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> or alien may exercise the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a patron or present to a living in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>. To the king, as patron paramount of all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, belongs the right of presenting to those <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> to which no other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has a <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a>.
