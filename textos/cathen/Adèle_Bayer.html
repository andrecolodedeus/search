<h1>Ad&egrave;le Bayer</h1>  

<p>(<em>n&eacute;e</em> Parmentier)

<p>Eldest daughter of Andrew Parmentier, b. in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 4 July, 1814, and d. in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, New York, 22 January, 1892. Andrew Parmentier, a horticulturist and civil engineer, was b. at Enghien, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 3 July, 1780, and d. in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, New York, 26 November, 1830. His father, Andrew Joseph Parmentier, was a wealthy linen merchant, and his eldest brother Joseph had a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> repute as a horticulturist and landscape gardener. Trained by the latter, Andrew <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to New York in 1824, on his way to the West Indies, taking with him his share of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> estate. He was persuaded by friends to remain in New York as a place where his abilities and scientific training would meet with recognition. He purchased a tract of land near Brooklyn which he laid out as a horticultural park. It became famous in a short time and his services as an expert in designing pleasure grounds were sought for in many places North and South. He is said to have exercised a more potent influence in landscape gardening in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> than any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of his profession up to that time. He was the first to introduce into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the black beech tree and several varieties of shrubs, vegetables, and vines. He was one of the founders and trustees of St. James's, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in the present <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Diocese of Brooklyn</a>, and was at the height of his influence and repute when he died in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, 26 November, 1830. After his death his daughter Ad&egrave;le and her mother (Sylvia M., b. at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 1793; d. in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, New York, 27 April, 1882), carried on his Botanical and Horticultural Gardens until 1832, when they were sold. Thereafter they devoted most of their time and income to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, aided substantially the Indian missions of <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Father De Smet, S.J.</a>, the establishment in <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> of the Sisters of Providence from Brittany, the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. Ad&egrave;le was married, 8 Sept., 1841, to Edward Bayer, a German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> merchant (d. 3 Feb., 1894), at the first nuptial Mass celebrated in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>. During the Civil War Madame Bayer began caring for the spiritual and temporal wants of the sailors at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a work to which she devoted the remainder of her life. For thirty years she toiled unostentatiously at this <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> task and was known and revered as a guardian and friend by seamen all over the world.
