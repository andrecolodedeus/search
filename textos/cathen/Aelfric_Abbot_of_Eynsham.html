<h1>Aelfric, Abbot of Eynsham</h1>  

<p>Also known as "the Grammarian", the author of the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> in Anglo-Saxon, a translator of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, and a writer upon many miscellaneous subjects. He seems to have been born about 955, and to have died about 1020. The identity of this writer has been the subject of much controversy. Even in Freeman's "Norman Conquest" he is wrongly identified with Aelfric, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> (1005). But of late years nearly all scholars have come round to the opinion of <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a> and Dietrich that there was but one Aelfric famous in Anglo-Saxon literature, and that this man was never raised to any higher dignity than that of Abbot. Of his career we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> but little. He was undoubtedly a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Old Monastery of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> under <a href="../cathen/01310b.htm">Saint Athelwold</a>, whose life he subsequently wrote in Latin. Some time after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> into the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, he was sent to Carne Abbey, or as he himself writes it "Cernel", in Dorsetshire. Thence he became, in 1005, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the recently-founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Eynsham, near <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he probably remained until his death. Of all the writers in Anglo-Saxon who have been preserved to us Aelfric was the most prolific. He is especially remembered for his Homilies, around the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> teaching of which concerning the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> a great controversy has raged. Already in the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was asserted by Mathew Parker, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, that Aelfric in his Homily for <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a> clearly evinced his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>, and that he must, moreover, be regarded as expressing the sentiments of the whole Anglo-Saxon church, of which he was a prominent and trusted representative. The details of the controversy cannot be discussed here. It may, however, be noted that the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> writer, W. Hunt, who eighteen years ago in the "Dictionary of National Biography" described Aelfric as vigorously opposing "the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the subject of the Eucharist," has recently so far modified his view to allow that "it is possible to reconcile Aelfric's words with the present teachings of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; his expressions are loose and unphilosophical, and, therefore, capable of being interpreted according to demand." ("The English Church to the Norman Conquest," p. 376.) This latter view is undoubtedly the more correct. Aelfric never intended to attack the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>. He quotes with approval instances of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> appearance of blood at the breaking of the Host. But he had adopted the views of Ratramnus of Corbie, whom he repeatedly paraphrases, insisting that in the Eucharist was a "spiritual" presence as opposed to a "bodily" (i.e., fleshly or carnal) one. That Ratramnus was no opponent of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> has recently been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to demonstration in the monograph of Dr. Aug. Naegle (Vienna, 1903). Aelfric's numerous works in Anglo-Saxon, which give evidence of much literary power, have been edited with translations; the former in 1846, by Thorpe; the latter in 1906, by Skeat.
