<h1>Afflighem</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> near Alost in Brabant, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. It was founded by a party of six <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">knights</a> who, after abandoning their wild life, had resolved to do penance in the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> on the scene of their former excesses. After building a church, they received, in 1084, a gift of the neighbouring lands from the Countess Adela and her sons. The <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a> was adopted, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, Wederig, having been the instrument of their conversion, and in after times the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> became known for its strict observance of religious <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>. The Dukes of Brabant and Lorraine, and the Counts of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and Bologne were its patrons and protectors, and regarded it as a coveted privilege to be buried in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church. Several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, among them <a href="../cathen/09658a.htm">Maria-Laach</a>, owe their foundation to <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Afflighem. <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, who visited the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 1146, declared that he had found <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> there. It was during this visit that an image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> is said to have replied to the salutation of the Saint. In 1523, Afflighem joined the Bursfeld Congregation &#151; a union of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Monasteries formed in the fifteenth century for the stricter observance of monastic rule. In 1569, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> became <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a> and exercised his authority through a prior. This continued until the Suppression. Archbishop Boonen desired to sever relations with the Bursfeld Congregation and introduce the <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> observance. Yielding to his solicitations, the Prior, Benedict Haeften, founded, in 1627, a new congregation, "B. M. V. in Templo Pr(sentat(". It included Afflighem and several other <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. It was dissolved in 1654. In 1796, in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were dispersed, the buildings destroyed, and the lands sold. The last Prior, Beda Regauts, preserved the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, and the staff and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> which had been presented by St. Bernard. These came into the possession of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, Veremund Daens, who, in 1838, began a new foundation at Termonde, which was transferred in 1869 to Afflighem. The first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the old <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was Fulgentius (1088-1122). Among the more prominent of his successors may be mentioned Franco, (1122-35), the author of twelve books "De Grati(" (P.L., CLXVI), Albert, whose <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to Our Lady</a> won him the title <em>Abbas Marianus</em>, and Benedict Haeften, the author of several works of art.
