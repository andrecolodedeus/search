<h1>Afonzo de Albuquerque</h1>  

<p>(Also D<font size=-2>ALBOQUERQUE</font>; surnamed "T<font size=-2>HE</font> G<font size=-2>REAT</font>").

<p>Died at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> 16 December, 1515. He was second son of Gonzallo de Albuquerque, lord of Villaverde, and became attached to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the king of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. He went to <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a> with Alphonso V in 1480, and made his first voyage to the far East in 1503, returning to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> 1504. When Tristan de Cunha sailed for <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> in 1506, Albuquerque was one of his officers. He formed the plan to monopolize trade with East <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> for <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, by excluding from it both the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, and therefore sought to make himself master of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>. For that purpose he seized the Island of Socotra and attacked Ormuz, landing 10 October, 1507, and raising fortifications. The attack was repeated in the year following, also at Cochim in December. When the Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, d'Almeida, returned to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, 1509, Albuquerque was appointed in his place. In 1513, King Emmanuel calls him "protho-capitaneus noster". Annoyed by constant hostilities of the people of Calicut, he destroyed the place on 4 January, 1510. To secure a permanent foothold on the coast of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, he took <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> in March, 1510, abandoning it two months afterwards, only to return in November, when he took the place again, and held it thereafter for the Portuguese. Once safely established on the eastern coast of what is generally comprised under the name of Dekkan, Albuquerque turned his attention to the organization of the colonies and to discoveries towards the farthest East. He took Malacca in July, 1511, and attempted to explore the Moluccas in the same year. In pursuance of his policy to prevent other nations from intercourse with <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, he occupied a strong position at Aden, on the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, March, 1513, but about the same time the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> had conquered <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and effectively barred access to the far East to all other nations except by sea. While Albuquerque was thus establishing Portuguese colonization in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> on a firm footing, and planning advances beyond Eastern <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, the Crown of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> was listening to intrigues to his prejudice. Still it may be that the state of his health, greatly impaired through climate and strain, induced King Emmanuel to provide for a successor. Albuquerque was manifestly broken down physically. So Lope Francisco Su&aacute;rez was sent to supersede him. The news of what he considered an act of ingratitude prostrated him, and although King Emmanuel recommended, in forcible terms to his successor to pay special deference to the meritorious leader, expressing, at the same time regret at having removed him from his high position, Albuquerque pined and died at the entrance of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, 16 December, 1515. Fifty-one years later his remains were transported to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, where a more worthy resting place had been prepared for them. Among the distinguished leaders and administrators that sprang up in southern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> at the end of the sixteenth century, Alfonzo de Albuquerque holds a very prominent position. His achievements, from a military standpoint, were more remarkable than any of the so-called conquerors of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>; for he had to cope with adversaries armed very nearly like the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, with hosts that were superior to any that were encountered by <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cortez</a> or Pizarro, and had at his command forces hardly more numerous than those that achieved the conquest of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> and Mexico. His enemies opposed him at sea, as well as on land, and they might, at any time, obtain succour from powerful <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> states interlying between <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. His only route for communication and relief was around the Cape of Good Hope. When, during the last five years of his life, he could at last turn to organization and administration, he proved himself a great man in this respect also. His religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was not the less notable. He built churches in <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> and had <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and a famous <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> with him. The church of the Blessed Virgin at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, which he built, is called by Fathers Spellmann, S.J., "the cradle of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, not only in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, but in all East <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>". (Kirchenlexicon, V, s.v. <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>).

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">Perhaps the earliest mention of Albuquerque and his achievements in the Far East is due to King Emmanuel himself in his letter of "idus Junias", 1513, Epistola Potentissimi Regis Portugalensis et Algarbiarum, etc., De Victoriis habitis in India et Malachia (Rome, 9 Aug., 1518), wherein the King calls him (perhaps a misprint) "Albiecherqe". There are several editions, some without place or date; JO&Auml;N DE BARROS, Asia (second decade, Lisbon, 1553); FERN&Auml;O LOPEZ DE CASTANHEDA, Historia do descubrimiento &amp; conquista da India (Coimbra, 1552), II, III; DAMI&Auml;O DE GOES, Chronica do Serenissimo Senhor Rei d. Manuel (Second ed., Lisbon, 1749, by Reinerio Bocache). An important, but of necessity partial source is the work of his natural son (Albuquerque was never married) Braz, who took the name of AFONSO THE YOUNGER, Commentarios do Grande Afonso Dalboquerque, capitan geral que foy das Indias Orientoes, etc. (First ed., Lisbon 1576, second ed. (Ibid., 1776), English tr. By Hakluyt Society, 1875-84, The commentaries of the great Afonso Dalboquerque, four vols.; Biographie universelle (Paris, 1854), I; SILVA, Diccionario bibliografico portuguez (Lisbon, 1859), I.</p></div>
