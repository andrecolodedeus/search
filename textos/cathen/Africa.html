<h1>Africa</h1>  

<p>This name, which is of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> origin, was at first given by the Romans to the territory about the city of Carthage. It gradually came to be applied to the whole Libyan territory occupied by the Romans, and it was understood in this sense, as late as the eleventh century, by <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope St. Leo IX</a>, who, when asked to decide as to the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of ancient Numidia, wrote these words, now engraved in letters of gold on the modern basilica of Carthage, built by <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a>: "Sine dubio, post Romanum pontificem, primus Nubiae episcopus et totius Africae maximus metropolitanus est Carthaginiensis episcopus" (There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that after the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11147a.htm">Nubia</a>, and indeed the principal <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Africa is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>). In their turn the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> adopted the name; then the writers of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; finally it has come to include the entire continent.
<h2 id="section1">The country</h2>

<p>Africa is, in extent, about 12,000,000 square miles, or about three times as large as <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and five times as large as the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, without Alaska. It is joined to the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> continent only by the Isthmus of Suez. Its general shape is that of an irregular triangle, which peculiarity of shape, with the scarcity of bays or harbours, seriously affected its historical development prior to the use of steam. It rests on a rocky foundation, which forms an immense plateau in the interior, whence, in isolated masses, branch off ranges like the Atlas, the mountains of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, Cape Colony, the Orange River Colony, the Transvaal, the Kenya, Kilima-Njaro, the Mfumbiro, and the Kameruns. These mountains, which attain in some places a height of 20,000 feet, have the appearance of islets, where rise in stages belts of a wonderfully varied vegetation. This plateau is bounded by a coast depression, whence the land sinks gradually. The west coast, from <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a> to the Cape, is extremely rough and difficult, to approach. On the Equator the rains are frequent and torrential; at Gaboon, for instance, it rains every day for nine months, the atmosphere is heavy with humidity, and the heat is maintained at an almost unchanging temperature. An enormous quantity of water is gathered in aerial seas by the winds, which, meeting, neutralize each other. This water, drawn down by the daily thunder-storms, forms the vast reservoirs of the interior: the lakes of Timbuctu, Tchad, <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>, Albert, Tanganyika, Bangweolo, Mweru, Nyassa, and others, whence flow the principal rivers: the Niger, the Benue, the Congo, the Zambesi, and the Nile, and others, less known, but of considerable importance. Most of them flow to the sea over rocky beds, forming rapids and waterfalls. These rivers have their sources at a much greater altitude than the rivers of other continents. The source of the Congo is at a height of 6,000 feet; of the Nile at 4,500; and of the Niger at 3,000; while that of the Amazon is not more than 700 feet, and the Mississippi only about 2,000 feet. It has been said that Africa has been less travelled than any other part of the world. It is there that are found, more than anywhere else, huge mountains, such as Kilima-Njaro, Kenya, etc., which rise suddenly from the level surface of great plains; vast lakes of uncertain outlines, which seem at one time to be drying up and at another to be making new inroads on the land; long rivers whose branches cover millions of square miles, and which, like the Nile, flow slowly through valleys as desolate as an unfinished world; solemn forests and the endless <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, vast and well suited to the peculiar nature of such great plants as the baobab, and of strange creatures like the ostrich, the giraffe, the elephant, the hippopotamus, and the gorilla; in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it is the primitive world. It is in the Equatorial zone, and especially towards the west, that the forests are largest, while in other parts they are somewhat irregularly scattered, with trees rising straight and mighty above a vigorous undergrowth. It is possible to travel for days, and even months, in these forests without so much as a glimpse of the sky, except in some chance clearing where the natives have cut down a few trees, to build their little village, or to till their fields. Silence reigns everywhere, broken only, in the daytime, by an occasional flapping of wings overhead; and at night by the shrill music of insects in a monotonous chorus. Storms echo in a frightful fashion; the rains cause an invariable humidity, rendering everything impervious to fire, and it is only during the short dry season of three or four months that it is safe to penetrate these forests. On both sides of the Equator, as far as 15 degrees north and 20 degrees south, stretches a zone that has two seasons, a rainy and a dry season. In this region, the great virgin forest and perpetual verdure are but seldom found save in the narrow spaces, stretching ribbonlike along the river banks, or crowding in the valleys, or climbing, in rows, along the mountain-sides. Elsewhere are found great prairies, over which the fire passes at the end of each dry season, and where roam great herds of antelope, giraffe, zebu, and buffalo. Beyond this double zone, which begins with Equatorial landscapes and ends in a semi-desert, stretches another zone of rocks, grass-lands, swamps, clay, and almost wholly barren sand. This, to the north, is the Sahara and the Libyan <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>; to the south, the Kalahari and the solitude that surrounds it. It is a land where the sky is without cloud, and the earth without shade. These <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a>, which are not lacking in grandeur and attraction, mark, north and south, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> boundaries of Africa. Beyond them, north and south &#151; to the north, Mauretania, Algeria, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; to the south, the region of Cape Colony &#151; the soil, the climate, the fauna and flora, the inhabitants are no longer characteristically African, but <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a>.
<h2 id="section2">The inhabitants</h2>

<p>The most recent statistics give the population of Africa as from 160,000,000 to 200,000,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Of these, 128,000,000 represent the black element very unevenly distributed over the 12,000,000 square miles of surface. In some parts it is very dense, as in the valleys of the Nile and of the Niger; in Algeria, <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>; in certain States of the <a href="../cathen/14325a.htm">Sudan</a>; near the lakes of the interior, and in the region of Cape Colony; while it is very sparse in great spaces like the Sahara and the Kalahari <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, or the swamps where the tributaries of the Nile and of the Zambesi pour their sluggish currents.

<p>The occupation of the continent by the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> nations, which put an end to local <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, slave-raids, and, to some extent, to poisonings, <a href="../cathen/08001b.htm">infanticide</a>, and human <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, might well lead men to <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> for the repeopling of Africa. These advantages, however, seem, in modern times, sadly outweighed by the spread of the dread sleepingsickness and other contagious diseases, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and the breaking up of native <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life, due to contact with our civilization.

<p>African ethnography presents a very complicated problem. Five thousand years before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the valley of the Nile was inhabited by a population already possessing a remarkable civilization. Traces of its occupation even prior to that period, during the Age of Stone, have been found from the Atlas to the Cape, from <a href="../cathen/14139a.htm">Somaliland</a> to the Guinea Coast. The question, then, arises, whether these primitive populations may not now be represented by the Negritos, or Pygmies, of Africa, mentioned by ancient authors and once more discovered in modern times. Under the various names of "Akka", "Ba-twa", "A-kwa", "Be-k&uuml;", etc., they are met with in scanty groups throughout Equatorial Africa, from the banks of the Tuba to the valley of the Ogowai (French Congo) and that of the Congo. Near the Cunene they come in contact with another population of similar stature (4 ft. to 4 ft. 2 in.), manners, and physical qualities: the "S&acirc;n", called "Bosjesmannen" by the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, and "Bushmen" in English. There are two types: one black, the other yellowish; but they undoubtedly constitute distinct races, with well marked ethnic characteristics. There are valid reasons for thinking that these tribes formerly lived in <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> and in the Nile basin. Traces of similar populations are found in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; and, at the present day a parallel race represented by the Negritos of the Andamans, Moluccas, and the islands in the vicinity of IndoChina. These little men would therefore seem to have occupied the whole of the ancient continent, scattering from a central point, which, if we may trust certain indications, was the valley of the Euphrates. That which is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, is that the Negritos appear in Africa as a primitive population, which was scattered by the stronger and better organized tribes who came after them. This, moreover, is exactly the notion they have formed concerning themselves, and which has been formed of them by the blacks; they look on themselves, and are looked on by their neighbours, as the first owners of the Earth. It is to them that the forest belongs, with all that it contains, animals and fruits; and it is they who possess the secrets of African nature. Their life is everywhere the same; they are nomads, who make no settled encampments, have no trade, commerce, or farming, neither flocks nor domestic animals of any kind, except a small dog, also found all over Africa, whose life is on a level with the wretched life of his master. These people live by <a href="../cathen/07563c.htm">hunting</a>, by what they can pick up or beg from the agricultural or pastoral tribes among whom they live, and whom they supply with meat, <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, and rubber. Their language as a rule resembles that of the people among whom they have stayed longest.



<p>It is, however, among the S&acirc;n (Bushmen) that we must look for the race which, it would seem, grew up shortly afterwards by mingling their blood, and possibly their speech, with that of the Negritos (dwarfs). These are the Namas, Nama-kwa, Grikwa (Griqua), etc., known to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> by the generic name of <a href="../cathen/07497a.htm">Hottentots</a> (a name derived from a <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> word meaning "brute"). Somewhat taller, of a darker colour, with longer hair, equally prone to obesity, they have fixed villages and lead a pastoral life. Their language, which is agglutinative, with pronominal suffixes, is characterized by the use of four different kinds of "clicks", also used by the San, and which have no equivalent in our alphabet. In the opinion of many scholars &#151; among them, Deniker &#151; the primitive <a href="../cathen/07497a.htm">Hottentots</a> before their fusion with the San were the original Bantu. This word (from <em>mu-ntu</em>, "man", "a being endowed with <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>", plural, <em>ba-ntu</em>) has been used to designate an important family of languages which stretches from one ocean to the other, from the basin of the <a href="../cathen/04228a.htm">Congo</a> and the Victoria Nyanza in the north, to the Orange River and the Limpopo, deducting the <a href="../cathen/07497a.htm">Hottentot</a> tribes.

<p>Although every tribe in this vast region has its own language, the basis of vocabulary and grammar is common to them all. They are agglutinative in structure, and characterized by pronominal prefixes which not only determine the number and <a href="../cathen/03433a.htm">category</a> of the noun, but extend to the adjective and the verb by very rational rules, which are always applied.

<p>The Bantu, who include, among other better known tribes, the Zulus, Basutos, Matabele, Makua, Wa-swahili, Wa-nyamwezi, Ba-ganda, Ba-congo, Uepongwe, Fang, etc., present a great variety of types, due, no doubt, to divers mixtures of race, which, as a rule, it is difficult to trace very far back. Their manner of life seems to depend chiefly on the country they live in; they are farmers, shepherds, and fishermen. Certain tribes, such as the Ba-ganda, have formed, and still form, large communities with regular institutions, generally in the form of an autocratic government. Most of them, however, have maintained their patriarchal life, and are scattered in little villages, practically independent of each other. Moreover, litigation and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slavery</a>, <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a>, the practice of a degrading <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">fetishism</a>, with their train of legal <a href="../cathen/08001b.htm">infanticide</a>, <a href="../cathen/11276b.htm">trials by poison and by fire</a>, arbitrary condemnations, poisonings, human <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and even cannibalism, prevail more or less extensively, and to a greater or less degree among all these interesting peoples.

<p>Besides the lands occupied by the Bantu, there are to be found in the valleys of Senegal, Gambia, of the Niger, Lake Tchad, and Benue, strong and numerous tribes of a more markedly <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> type, of great stature, strongly dolichocephalous, with very black skins, rounded foreheads, thick lips, and frequent prognathism. These tribes, sufficiently varied in appearance, are often known under the generic name of Nigritians, and are divided into four principal groups: the Nilotic <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>, such as the Mittu, the Bari, the Bongo, the Sand&eacute;, etc.; the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> of the central <a href="../cathen/14325a.htm">Sudan</a>, such as the natives of Bornu, Baghirmi, Wada&iuml;, Darfur, Kordofan, etc.; the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> of the western <a href="../cathen/14325a.htm">Sudan</a>, such as the Sonrha&iuml;, the Mossi, the Mandink&eacute;, and their kinsmen (Malink&eacute;, Bambara, Sonink&eacute;); and, finally, the coast, or Guinea, <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>, such as the Volof, the Sener, the Susu, the Aku, the Ashanti, the Fanti, the people of <a href="../cathen/04603b.htm">Dahomey</a>, the Egbas, the Yoruba, the Mina, the Ibo, etc. These tribes are, as a rule, stronger than the Bantu, more industrious, better organized for fighting, and for resistance to invasion. Many, indeed, have known real epochs of prosperity and greatness.

<p>Moreover, this superiority is most clearly marked in proportion to the "crossing" of races. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the "All-colours", belonging to a different ethnic type, represented by the Hamites (Chamites), also known as Kushites, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11147a.htm">Nubians</a>. To this group should be joined the Bedja of <a href="../cathen/11147a.htm">Nubia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a>, the Oromo, or Gallas, the Afora, or Danakil, the Somalis, the Masai, and, in the west, the Fula and the Fulb&eacute;. All these tribes, whose skin is black, bronze, or reddish &#151; the result, no doubt of a considerable mingling with the tribes they first met with &#151; are, as a rule, of a regular type, often handsome, with shapely limbs, oval faces, long noses, and hair long and curly; all with an air that appears to greater advantage from their skill in draping themselves in the fashion of antique <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>. They are no longer <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>. Most of them lead a pastoral life and, divided into something like clans, tend their flocks on the wide strip of half-desert pasture-land which stretches from Cape Gardafui to Cape Verde. They are intelligent, warlike, independent, given to pillage, and full of scorn for inferior races; they are bad neighbours, but have great influence wherever they may be.

<p>From the Hamites we pass, by a natural transition, to the Berbers, who have held northern Africa for many centuries. While the other tribes are of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> origin, the Berbers came from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> at an unknown period, and belong to two types, the brown and the fair. About A.D. 1100, they founded Timbuctoo, and spread as far as the <a href="../cathen/03243a.htm">Canary Islands</a>; then, roused by <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, they made their way into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and threatened the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. They are represented by the Barabra, the Kabyles of the Atlas, the Tuareg of the Sahara, and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> of the western coast, and have had a considerable part in the formation of the so-called "Arab" populations of the "Barbary States".

<p>In addition to these various elements, yet another, the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a>, has settled among, and to some extent mingled with, the people of Africa. This element is to be found chiefly in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, and on the East Coast. In more recent times there has been an influx of modern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> in Guinea, <a href="../cathen/01512b.htm">Angola</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10610a.htm">Mozambique</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> on the Gold Coast, at the Cape, and in the valleys of the Orange and the Limpopo; the English, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a>, and French in their recent colonies. Thus, at periods which it is impossible to determine, men evidently of the same species, but not of the same race, settled on this primitive soil, mingling some of their qualities, changing their hues, confounding their customs and their speech, yet, nevertheless, often retaining clear traces of their original descent.
<h2 id="section3">Religion</h2>
<h3 id="A">Native Religion</h3>

<p>There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that there is to be found among the nations of Africa, apart from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, a religion, a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a higher, living, and personal principle, implying on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> part the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of recognizing it by means of some kind of worship.

<p>Individuals, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and even communities may doubtless be found in Africa, as elsewhere, utterly, or almost, devoid of all notion of religion and morality. This fact has led certain travellers, who, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, were not familiar with the native languages, who had not penetrated into the inner secrets of the peoples they professed to have studied, and who, in addition, were often wrongly informed by chance interpreters, into the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that tribes without a religion exist in Africa. A more careful study, however, makes it possible to assert that in Africa religion is everywhere, as M. Robert H. Nassau says, "closely bound up with the different matters which concern the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, authority, the organization of the tribe &#151; with judicial trials, punishments, foreign relations, and with trade". Religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices, characterized by the two principal elements of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and sacrifice, form part of the daily life of the blacks.

<p>What is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, however, is that no body of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, properly so called, exists anywhere with interpreters bound to ensure its integrity, to explain and to hand it down to others. There is, therefore, no distinct religious code, no official teaching, no books, no <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, and other positive <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. What is known concerning <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> matters is a sort of common deposit, guarded by everybody, and handed down without any intervention on the part of an authority; fuller in one place, scantier in another, or, again, more loaded with external symbols according to the intelligence, the temperament, the organization, the habits, and the manner of the people's life. Certain specialists, however, exist, known to us as sorcerers, witch-doctors, etc., who are familiar with the mysterious secrets of things, who make use of them on behalf of those interested, and hand them down to chosen <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. There are also <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a> which guard what may be called the preternatural tradition of the tribe, and deduce therefrom the decisions to be arrived at.

<p>Finally, it is understood that certain things are forbidden; there are prohibitions which cannot be defied save at the risk of misfortune. Nevertheless, that which ethnologists call <a href="../cathen/10717a.htm">Naturism</a>, <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a>, or <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> nowhere constitutes in primitive Africa a body of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, with correlative <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> and settled practice which may be reduced to a system.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Being</a> higher than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, invisible, inaccessible, master of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and death, orderer of all things, seems to exist everywhere; among the Negritos, the <a href="../cathen/07497a.htm">Hottentots</a>, the Bantu, the Nigritians, the Hamites; for everywhere this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Being</a> has a name. He is the "Great", the "Ancient One", the "Heavenly One", the "Bright One", the "Master", sometimes the "Author", or "Creator". The notion, however, concerning Him is clear, obliterated, or vague according to the tribe; nowhere, at least, is He represented under any image, for He is incapable of representation.

<p>What does He require of us? What are His relations with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>? Has <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> any aim? &#151; All this is unknown; it is unasked. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> finds himself a being on the earth, like the plants and animals. That fact he is <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">conscious</a> of. He eats, he reproduces himself, he does what he can; he dies also, as a rule, though death is looked on as an accident, the causes of which must always be inquired into. In the hereafter, the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a> or shadows of kings, chiefs, witch-doctors, of great men, rich and powerful, being set free from the bodies to which they were united, wander through <a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">space</a> until they <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">find another body</a> into which to enter. They keep after this life the power, often intensified, which they had before; they can injure or give help; they can influence the elements. More, they often bring news of themselves; they cause most of the sicknesses of children; they are seen in <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dreams</a>; they cause nightmares; they are heard at night; they show themselves in many inexplicable phenomena. The shades of ordinary <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have less power; of no importance after death, as in <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, they disappear.

<p>It is important, however, to give all these shades a fixed abode. This is done by means of certain complicated <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>: by calling them into caves, into sacred groves, to the foot of certain trees, sometimes into living animals, but more often into statuettes of earth, wood, or metal, placed on the skull of the ancestor, or containing some part of his remains &#151; nails, hair, eyebrows, or skin. There are some rebellious shades, however, who are difficult to keep in one spot; they are called back by means of fresh <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>. Moreover, on all <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> occasions &#151; for the success of a journey, of a <a href="../cathen/07563c.htm">hunt</a>, of a trade, or <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, to ward off a plague, to turn aside misfortune &#151; recourse is had to the sacred object; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are said to it, and offerings made (glass beads, rice, maize, milk, beer); victims are <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to it, <a href="../cathen/02576b.htm">birds</a>, kids, sheep, oxen, men; for the more the shade is to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> the more worthy must be the sacrifice.

<p>Nor is this all. The <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> must, of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, be eaten in common; it is by drinking the blood, and by eating the flesh of the animal or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, in company with the manes of the ancestors vanished, yet present, that their favours are obtained, and they are satisfied. This satisfaction is most esteemed when it is possible to sacrifice their enemies, those who have <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> their death, and on whom they thus wreak the sweetest revenge that can be dreamed of. This is the origin of cannibalism, which in some parts of Africa has taken on peculiarly disgusting forms.

<p>Ancestor worship, in one form or other, is thus the chief expression of African religion. But besides shades, there are a number of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a>, whose origin is unknown, who reveal themselves in various ways. Most of these are wicked, some terrible, but others are mischievous, capricious, fanciful; while some, again, are more or less indifferent, and sometimes well-disposed. It is the darksome activity of these <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a> which must be held accountable for the epidemics, storms, droughts, floods, and fires &#151; all the ills that seem to have no apparent cause. The same holds <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possession</a>, so common everywhere.

<p>To offset these ills it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to consult the "seers", who, after the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>, will find the name and <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> who is at fault, will indicate the specialist (witch-doctor) to whom recourse must be had, and who will obtain the desired result, a cessation of the trial, a cure of the sickness, an end to the possession, by means of the practices or <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> demanded by the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>.

<p>In a word, from the point of view of the black man, the world was formed to progress regularly, and might possibly have attained its end, had its <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> so willed it. But, for unknown reasons, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had left His work exposed to many harmful influences of elements, of animals, of men, of sorcerers, of ghosts, of <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a>. And, since He is beyond <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> reach, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> cannot get to where He is, and can do nothing against His action or His inactivity, he is led to placate or to neutralize such influences as can be reached among the thousands that everywhere reveal themselves.

<p>It is to the general scheme of these mysterious things that we must reduce the almost universal <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that there exists for each <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, for each <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, something sacred or forbidden, the <em>taboo</em> of the Maoris, which cannot be touched without misfortune: a fruit, a tree, a fish, an animal, whose name one bears. It is to this scheme, again, that the use of <a href="../cathen/01443a.htm">amulets</a> must be referred, made, as they are, of rare and outlandish things; of mysterious remedies, of protective fetishes for everything and against everything. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, <a href="../cathen/14475a.htm">second-sight</a>, philtres, enchantments, horoscopes, forecasts, are equally well known. Judicial trials, held to make known the guilty, are of daily occurrence.

<p>But, just as it is possible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to use to his advantage or to neutralize, these mysterious influences, these secret virtues in things, so he can make use of them to effect his revenge, to do harm to those about him, as do sorcerers, conjurers, or wizards. In league with hidden powers, these practitioners send sicknesses, cause death, <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">bewitch</a> their enemies, and roam at night in the form of a ball of fire, of some bird or animal, to spread their <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witcheries</a>. They are, consequently, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">feared</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>. Many have recourse to them, if they can get to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, in order to join them, or to follow them with their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. If they are discovered, they are made to do penance, are sold, killed, or burned, as local <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> shall decide. It is curious to meet, in the heart of Africa, with facts of <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a> absolutely identical with those known among us in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and even at the present day. And, if these wizards and <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a> practice their arts at the risk of their lives, it may be well to add that they have not seldom merited their <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, for many of them, in addition to and aside from their relations to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, are undeniably very skilful poisoners.

<p>Certain anthropologists and ethnologists, anxious to find in Africa a territory propitious to their theories, endeavour to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the religious evolution of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> starts from simple <a href="../cathen/10717a.htm">Naturism</a>, whence it proceeds to <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a>, and thence to <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>, to attain at length to a more or less pure Theism. This upward march, which supposes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to have set out from the lowest stage towards an indefinite progress, appears reasonable. But it is reasoning <em>a priori</em>, based on an untenable hypothesis. The actual facts are found on examination to be far from agreement with this theory.

<p>(1) <em><a href="../cathen/10717a.htm">Naturism</a></em> is the worship paid to personified natural objects: the sky, the sun, the moon, the mountains, the thunder, etc. The <a href="../cathen/07497a.htm">Hottentots</a> have been said to adore the moon, in whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> they perform long dances. This statement, however, is now known to be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07497a.htm">Hottentots</a>, like all Africans, are fond of dancing by moonlight; they hail the moon's reappearance and follow her course closely, since it is she who measures time, but this is very far from being worship. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> objects of <a href="../cathen/07497a.htm">Hottentot</a> worship are the spirits of their dead. They recognize, moreover, a Power higher than these shades, "Tsu Goab", an expression which the missionaries have made use of to translate the word "God". Again, other Bantu tribes use terms which mean either "Sky" or "God", "Sun" or "God", etc., but make a clear distinction as to the meaning conveyed by these words. Not one, in fact, imagines that a material identity exists between the planet that gives us light, or the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> wherein it moves, and the Supreme Being who inhabits or makes use of them. The same may be said concerning the thunder. The blacks, indeed, sometimes say that it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who by this sign, foretells the rain, but this is not worship. <a href="../cathen/10717a.htm">Naturism</a>, in the strict sense given to the word, does not exist in Africa.

<p>(2) <em><a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a></em>, based on the distinction between matter and spirit, is the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in beings which have no affinity to any special thing in nature, but are endowed with a higher power; to whom a certain worship is paid, yet who are incapable of being represented in a visible form. Taken in this very vague and general sense, it may be said that <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a> is the religion of a great part of Africa: the Negritos, <a href="../cathen/07497a.htm">Hottentots</a>, Bantus of the south and east, many of the Nigritians, and most of the Hamites, have practically neither fetishes, idols, nor material images, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with any kind of worship. They believe, as we have said, in the survival of the spirits of the departed (under an ill-defined form which they liken, as a rule, to a shadow), in their possession of more or less power, in the need of honouring them, placating them, and settling them in fixed localities. They believe, also, in the existence of spirits differing from these shades; in mysterious influences; lastly, in a Higher Power which they more or less clearly distinguish from visible creation, from the earth, the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, etc. However, the want of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a supreme Deity, and scientific <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, are the causes of a great mass of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of all kinds among the blacks, even among those who are animists.

<p>(3) <em>Fetishism</em>. The question has been raised whether <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a> gave birth to <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>, or sprang from a purified <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>; but the discussion would be futile. These two forms of religion, if one may call them so, seem to correspond more closely with two divergent subjective dispositions than with two principles, two doctrines, or two traditions. We find, in fact, <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, in the midst of animist populations, who materialize the expression of their worship by making images, into which they summon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of their dead; and similarly, in the midst of <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">fetishist</a> populations, a number of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> who have no fetishes. The word "fetish", derived from the Portuguese <em>feitigo</em> (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>facticius</em>), signifies a material object to which is attributed a mysterious influence, in consequence of the presence or action of an invisible power in this sacred thing. <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> is the sum of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices existing in connection with this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. It is therefore a mistake to fancy that the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> adores the material of which his fetish is made, or attributes to it a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power. On the contrary, the fetish only possesses influence by means of the particular virtue which the <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">fetishist</a> has fixed in it. But, subject to this reservation, anything may become a fetish: images, bones of men or animals, figures more or less grotesque, stones, trees, huts, etc., according to circumstances or to personal predilection. As to the diffusion of <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>, Livingstone called attention to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that the blacks seem to be more <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and more <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> in proportion as the traveller penetrates into the forest country; an observation that was well founded. And, since western Africa is far more thickly wooded than the eastern part, it is chiefly in the west that we find classic <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>, with its material images and its coarse practices. It is practically non-existent among the <a href="../cathen/07497a.htm">Hottentots</a>, the Bantus of the east, the Nigritians, the Hamites, and the Negritos. We are thus led to conclude that these peoples, being more given to wandering than the others, often living a pastoral life in a more open country, have been less prone than were the sedentary tribes to materialize their worship in objects difficult to carry about with them. This, possibly, is the explanation of the phenomenon which attracted Livingstone's attention. However this may be, an impartial study of African religion makes it impossible for anyone, in the present state of acquaintance with the subject, to assert that man began on this great continent by having no religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; that from such a state he passed to <a href="../cathen/10717a.htm">Naturism</a>, to rise, by degrees, to <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a>, <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>, and Theism. Indeed, we find as many, or more, facts indicating that the black man, from a religious standpoint, has degenerated. In fact, from one end of Africa to the other we meet, overgrown by a more or less confused mass of strange <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>, the essential <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of that which everywhere has been looked upon as the primitive religion: an unseen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Master of all things, and Organizer of the world; the survival of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, under a form not clearly defined; at times, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of reward and punishment in the other world; the existence and activity of spirits, some of whom help men while others deceive them; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, sacrifice, the need of a worship; the sacred nature of a fruit, a tree, or an animal; the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of abstaining from certain actions, of practising self-restraint; the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, of the power left in man to wipe out its stain, etc. The sum total of this evidence &#151; and the list might be prolonged &#151; more or less clear, distinct, or scattered, collected from tribes of different origin which cannot possibly have met for centuries, leaves us convinced that at the beginning of the formation of the black race there were common <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices, such as are found at the beginnings of every <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>, and on which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> itself rests, as we have it today.
<h3 id="B">Judaism</h3>

<p>The first historical record of the settlement of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in Africa is the story of Joseph; but it is probable that there had been others there before him. Under Meses, who had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the court of the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> Rameses "in all the wisdom of the Egyptians" (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#vrs22">Acts 7:22</a>), the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Children of Israel</a> once more crossed the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>. Alexander of Macedon however, recalled many of them, in 332 B.C., to take part in the foundation of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, merchant princes and good soldiers, have also produced historians such as Alexander of <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a>, surnamed Polyhistor (though modern critics pronounce him a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> to whom some fragments of a Jewish tendency have been falsely attributed); <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, such as Aristobulus and Philo; elegant writers of Greek verse, such as the tragic poet Ezechiel (c. 200 &#151; 150 B.C.). It was at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> that the "Seventy" (<a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>) translated (third century B.C.) the Law and the Prophets into Greek. Thence, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> spread over the <a href="../cathen/04591b.htm">Cyrenaica</a>, and made their way to Carthage. A second wave of Jewish emigrants, moreover, left <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> on the conquest of the Carthaginian State by the Romans (146 B.C.), and founded trade-exchanges in most of the seaports of northern Africa. Hence, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, writing to <a href="../cathen/04634c.htm">Dardanus</a>, could say that the Jewish colonies formed in his time an unbroken chain across Africa, "from Mauretania to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>". Yet another scattering of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Children of Israel</a> followed the taking of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by Titus (A.D. 70) and the destruction of the Temple, bringing a third wave of Jewish emigrants into Roman Africa. The triumph of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> at <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a> (A.D. 630), and the rapid spread of his religion, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> a large number of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to leave Arabia. Of those who crossed the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> some took refuge in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, a country with which they had long had intercourse, and where they doubtless found some of their older colonies. It is from these, probably, that the Falashes and Gondas are descended, although these tribes trace their ancestry to Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Others took the well-known route to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and, following the Mediterranean coast, set out to rejoin their co-religionists in the territories of Tripoli and <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>. Some, by pursuing the caravan route of Dar-Fur, across the Wada&iuml;, Born&uuml;, and Sokoto, arrived, about the middle of the eleventh century, at the valley of the Niger. Finally, when, in 1492, they were driven from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, many of them went to <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, and others to <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>. Such varied origins have caused diversities of type, manners, and speech, among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Africa, but all have kept that peculiar, personal imprint which distinguishes everywhere the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Children of Israel</a>. It is estimated that the approximate number of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in Africa may be divided thus: 50,000 in <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>; 30,000 in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; 60,000 in <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>; 57,000 in Algeria; 100,000 in <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>; more than 10,000 along the border of the Sahara, and 1,800 at the Cape; giving a total of about 300,000. The study of their history in Africa leads to the conclusion that their <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheistic</a> influence was real in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Numidia, and even in the Sudan. At the present day, however, they carry on no religious propaganda, but are satisfied with keeping their <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Israelitish worship</a> intact, in communities more or less numerous and faithful, under the guidance of rabbis of various classes &#151; officiating rabbis, sacrificing rabbis, who attend to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, rabbi notaries, and grand rabbis.
<h3 id="C">Islamism</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a> has found in Africa a boundless sphere of conquest, and its uninterrupted spread, from the seventh century down to the present time, among all the races of the continent is one of the most remarkable facts of history. Today a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> may travel from Monrovia to <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a>, and thence to Batavia without once setting foot on "infidel" soil. Three phases in this movement of expansion may be distinguished. In the first (638 &#151; 1050) the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, in a rapid advance, propagated <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> along the whole Mediterranean coast, from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, a conquest greatly aided by the exploitation of the country by the Byzantine governors, the divisions among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and political disorganization. In the ninth and tenth centuries, however, the opposition of the Berbers and the too tardy resistance of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, assisted by the Normans, but chiefly the mutual strife of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> emirs, arrested its advance; there were still <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, and Constantine in the eleventh century. The second period (1050-1750) is connected with the invasion of the Himyarite (Arabian) Bedouins, sent by El Mestune, Caliph of Cairo, to chastise the Magreb, or country stretching from Tripoli to <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>. It was then that Mauretania became definitely <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamized</a>, and in its turn the centre of a propaganda carried on among the Berber tribes of the Atlas, and of the Sahara, and among the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> of the Sudan. This conquest, however, was not unresisted. We learn from an <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> historian, Ibn Khaldun, that the population of northern Africa was forced fourteen times, at the point of the sword, to embrace <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a>, and that it returned fourteen times to its own religion. Traces, moreover, of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> are still found among the Kabyles of Algeria, among the Tuaregs, and the Mzabetes of the Sahara. The name Tuareg (singular, <em>Targui</em>) was given by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> to the Berbers of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and means "those forsaken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". They were the founders of Timbuctoo (A.D. 1077), Djenn&eacute;, and of the principal centres of influence in northwest Africa. While this part of the continent was being converted, willingly or by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, to <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, eastern Africa was invaded in its turn by colonies of merchants, who, however, readily became warriors, and never failed to be apostles. It was thus that <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> gained the shores of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, Somaliland, the Zanzibar coast as far as Kiloa, and the islands as far as the Comoto Islands and Madagascar. One nation alone, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, entrenched in its huge, mountainous citadel, held out against them. Unfortunately, however, since the sixth century, it has held the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. It was on these unconquered <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> bestowed the scornful name of <em>Habesh</em>, meaning, "sweepings of the nations", whence the name <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> is derived. The last period of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> expansion extends to the present time. It is due to a veritable recrudescence of fanaticism, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> fostered by a number of religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, whose members, or Khuans, are to be found everywhere, and possess unbounded influence. Daily, one may say, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> spreads over the great African continent, creeping down from <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a> to Senegal, making inroads on the valley of the Niger and the shores of Lake Tchad, passing from Kordofan into Uganda, and from <a href="../cathen/15750c.htm">Zanzibar</a> to the Congo. Bitterly hostile to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> by its very nature, it is yet very skilful in adapting itself to circumstances. This is, doubtless, why so many governors, functionaries, travellers and writers, duped by this deep <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>, favour this expansion of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, and are even guilty of flagrant <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and abuse of power in imposing it on <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">fetishist</a> populations who have no wish to embrace it. As there are no <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> statistics, it is impossible to make an accurate census. The following figures may, however, be quoted: 4,070,000 in Algeria; 1,500,000 in <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>; 10,000,000 in <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>; 6,800,000 in French Western Africa; 3,000,000 in the Wada&iuml; and the Sudan, besides those in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Somaliland, <a href="../cathen/15750c.htm">Zanzibar</a>, and the interior. The total numbers of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> in Africa approximately amount to between thirty and forty millions. Its marvellous spread is due to various causes. In <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to begin with, and throughout northern Africa, it was a forcible conquest of countries and peoples in a state of utter social, political, and religious disorganization. These remnants of peoples were intoxicated by a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of great power, covering all that relates to the interests and concerns of man. From the new groups thus remoulded issued successively other conquerors, down to the recent uprisings of the Samory and the Rabah tribes in the Sudan. Moreover, since <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> is at once a religious <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, a social system, a political principle, a commercial interest, a civilization that arrogates to itself all manner of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> against the "infidel", it follows that each <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> is intimately possessed by the spirit of proselytism. To this end he may, and does, make use of every means; all is permissible against the "unbeliever". <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, therefore, imposes itself by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, by persuasion, by interest, by alliances, by the spirit of imitation, by fashion. It should be added that there is a real affinity between the manners and customs of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> and those of the more or less mixed populations of northern Africa; and between these and the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> tribes. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> exclusiveness becomes not a little modified by contact with <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>, and if <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> imposes certain <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices on its black disciples, they, in turn, bring into it a number of their <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> and usages. Finally, the extreme simplicity of its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, the easy yoke of its <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, its liberal indulgence in respect of morality, all sustained by the hope of a <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a> made up of well-defined and attractive pleasures, combine to make <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> an ideal religion for the childish intelligence and sensual nature of the African peoples among which it labours. These causes, of themselves, suffice to explain the slight hold that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has gained on the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> social system. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> who becomes a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> must renounce, not only his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but also his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, his social standing, his interests, all that binds him to the world. Hence it is evident how utterly mistaken those are who may have held that <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> is a kind of useful, possibly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, transition, between <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. On the contrary, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> as it were crystallizes the heart and mind of man. It is not a step taken upward, but a wall that arrests all progress. From a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and religious standpoint, however, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> is undoubtedly superior to the <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a>. It acknowledges but One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God Almighty</a>, who rewards good and punishes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in a future life; it teaches the need of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, penance, and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>; of a public worship; of abstaining from the use of fermented liquors, etc. But the absolute freedom with which it preys on the "infidel" by means of <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a>, slavery, thefts, and all kinds of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, the utter corruption and the spread of venereal diseases to which it gives rise, the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>, and laziness which it engenders in its disciples, the formidable cohesion which it gives them, make the expansion of "<a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> civilization" among <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">fetishist</a> peoples anything but desirable. From the standpoint of their proximate evolution they have more to lose from it than to gain. As <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">fetishists</a> they constitute a reserve for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization; as <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, they are lost to it.
<h3 id="D">Parseeism, Buddhism and Brahminism</h3>

<p>To be complete, this account should include certain Parsee colonies at <a href="../cathen/15750c.htm">Zanzibar</a>, Mombasa, Natal, and the Cape; Chinese and Indian <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a> in the Transvaal, and the Island of Mauritius; and the <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminist</a> Banyans, natives of Kurachi, Kach, and Bombay, who trade with intelligence and success in most of the centres of Eastern Africa, from Port Said to the Cape. None of these, however, make any <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a>, and all will receive due treatment under their respective titles.
<h3 id="E">Christianity</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> penetrated into Africa through two principal channels. It was first brought by the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> St. Mark to <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, where it soon shone with great splendour and was represented by such men as <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, and Cyril. It passed thence into Lower <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, then into the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>, Upper <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11147a.htm">Nubia</a>, and, by way of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> as far as <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, adopting as its own the Graeco-Jewish civilization, which it found prevailing in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04591b.htm">Cyrenaica</a>. At the same period, however, about the end of the first century, Roman soldiers and merchants brought the Gospel to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, whence it soon spread to Proconsular Africa, to the Byzacene province, and to Numidia, added a glorious band to the army of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and produced such Doctors as <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a>, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, Arnobius, Lactantius, Optatus, and the great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>.

<p>(1) <em>The Dissident Churches</em>. Unfortunately, <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">African Christianity</a> was constantly exposed to the attacks of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, who divided and enfeebled it, and so paved the way for its destruction, first, by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> and, finally, by <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. Most of these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> have long since disappeared; but the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> who, following <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, acknowledge only one nature in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (the divine nature having absorbed the human), have continued to exist, and form at the present time three distinct churches, namely: The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose Patriarch, or <em>Catholicos</em>, resides near <a href="../cathen/05527b.htm">ErzerumTheodosiopolis)</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">ARMENIA</a>); The Jacobite Church of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Mesopotamia, whose head is the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (see <a href="../cathen/14413a.htm">JACOBITES</a>, <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">MONOPHYSITES</a>); The Coptic Church of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, governed by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, resident at Cairo, who exercises a kind of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> suzerainty over the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. These <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> (from Gr., <em>Aigyptos</em>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>), descendants of the ancient Egyptians, are about 200,000 in number, and are spread over some twenty <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, as in the seventh and eighth centuries (see <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">COPTS</a>). In <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> number 3,500,000 out of a total population of nearly 4,000,000. The rest are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> (200,000), <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Israelites</a> (50,000), <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagans</a> (100,000), or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (30,000). The liberal proselytism of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> has made, and still makes, considerable efforts on this continent. Every nation in which <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> flourishes has taken part in this missionary work: <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>. In 1736 the Moravian Brethren established themselves at the Cape of Good Hope, and formed colonies of farmers and mechanics. Their influence has contributed to the civilization of the <a href="../cathen/07497a.htm">Hottentots</a> and <a href="../cathen/08591b.htm">Kafirs</a>. They settled among the <a href="../cathen/08591b.htm">Kafirs</a> in 1828, and, in 1885, to the north of Lake Nyassa. The mission which they had founded at Christiansborg, on the Gold Coast, and then abandoned, was taken up in 1828 by the <em>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des missions &eacute;vangeliques</em> of Basle, which has since spread to the country of the Ashantis, to the German colony of the Togo, and to the Kameruns, where they have replaced (1887) the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a>. From <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the Berlin Missions have sent their agents to the Orange River Colony, to Griqualand, the Transvaal, and German East Africa; the Rhenish Mission, to the <a href="../cathen/07497a.htm">Hottentots</a>, the Namas, the Herreros, and the Ovambos; the North-German Missions (Bremen and Hermannsburg) to Togoland and the Gold Coast; and, in the Transvaal, to the Basutos and the Zulus. Finally, there are the Scandinavian missions. The Swedes are established in the Italian colony of Erythr&aelig;a; the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegians</a> have an important mission at Betsileo, in <a href="../cathen/09509e.htm">Madagascar</a>, numbering 50,000 Malagasy. With the exception of the German mission of Hermannsburg, and the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> mission, which are distinctively <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, all the others have various creeds difficult to specify. The English missions are notably rich and numerous. The most important only need be mentioned here, namely: The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which dates from 1752, and labours on the Guinea Coast, at the Cape, and in Madagascar; The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Missionary Society, founded in 1799, which has fifteen <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in Africa; The <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Missionary Society, established in 1795 on an undenominational basis, which made its action chiefly felt in South Africa, with Moffat and Dr. Livingstone; The Universities Missions Society, with its centre at <a href="../cathen/15750c.htm">Zanzibar</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptist</a> Missions at Fernando Po, in the Kameruns and on the Congo; the <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodist</a> Missions of Sierra Leone, the Niger, and the Gold Coast; the Scottish Missions, etc. The <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Protestants</a>, in their turn, founded the <em>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des missions &eacute;vangeliques</em> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1824, which has sent its agents to the Basutos in northeastern Cape Colony, where they have been very successful; to the French Congo (Gaboon region), where they replaced the American <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a> (1892); to the Barotse country on the Upper Zambesi, and, finally, to <a href="../cathen/09509e.htm">Madagascar</a>, where they have been called upon to take the place, to some extent, of the English missions (1895). Nor must the American missions be forgotten. Three <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> have taken the chief part in this work: the <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodist</a> Episcopal Church, the <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptist Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> Church. The <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a> began their labours in the colony of <a href="../cathen/09216a.htm">Liberia</a> from its very foundation (1820), but it was only in 1858 that they were able to establish a permanent <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> there. The <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a>, also, have stations in Monrovia, <a href="../cathen/13783a.htm">Sierra Leone</a>, <a href="../cathen/09216a.htm">Liberia</a>, and Lagos. The most important missions, however, are those of the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> there is hardly a village on the Nile without one of their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, under a Coptic master. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, therefore, shows considerable activity in Africa, seconded, as it is, by the magnificent generosity of its adherents and of its numerous native assistants. It would be impossible in an article of this kind to specify not only all the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> engaged in African missions, but also the stations they occupy, the personnel they employ, the funds at their disposal, or the number of <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> which they profess to have gathered around them. The figures which might be quoted vary according to the documents consulted. There exists, moreover, no estimate of the total. Each year introduces startling discrepancies into the statistics, and in any attempt at exactitude, there is a risk of manifest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. However the most recent returns are as follows (1906):--

<p><a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in Africa, 95; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> missionaries, 1,158; Lay missionaries, 1,893; Native assistants employed, 15,732; Communicants, 274,650; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (approximately), 400,000.

<p>(2) <em>The Catholic Church</em>. We have already noted the rapid expansion of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> throughout northern Africa; the splendour which it derived from its many faithful, its <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a>, <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessors</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; the divisions that crept in; how it spread, on the one hand, from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to Libya and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, on the other, from the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Carthage to Numidia and Mauretania. Unfortunately, the Lower Empire, under whose sway this country had fallen, was more occupied with its religious quarrels than with its organization or defence, and was unable to withstand the successive inroads of the new peoples. <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> made its inroad, and at the end of the seventh century Africa became, so far as <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was concerned, to all intents and purposes a closed continent.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, never wholly forsook it, nor ever ceased to hope that it would one day be again open to her. According to the letters of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a> (1049-54) to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gumni, there were, even at this period, three or four <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in the very heart of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> territory: one at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, one at <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, and the third at <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Constantine</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> wrote: "Carthage will keep its canonical <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a> so long as the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> shall be invoked within its walls, whether its scanty monuments lie in the dust forever, as they lie today, or a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> shall one day cause its ruins to rise again". This seems almost a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the modern restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>, achieved in our day by <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a>, under the auspices of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> and the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders &#151; those, especially, for the redemption of captives &#151; brought about the establishment of a number of little <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> colonies along the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> shores of the Mediterranean. There was even a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, first at Fez, and then at Marrakesh, in <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a> (1223), which lasted until the sixteenth century. Another was established at Ceuta, after its capture by John I, King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (1418) <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> existed at <a href="../cathen/11266a.htm">Oran</a>, Tlemcen, Bona, Bougie, <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>, Tripoli, etc.; that is to say wherever the factories or counting-houses of Spanish, Italian, or French merchants were to be found. The Trinitarians alone, between the date of their foundation by St. John of Matha, in 1198, and the eighteenth century, set free nearly 900,000 <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slaves</a>, <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had been taken by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> has the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being the first to shake off the yoke of the soldiers of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, and to regain for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> a foothold on the African continent. The taking of Ceuta, followed by that of Tangier and Tetuan, was the starting-point for the exploration of the coasts. Guided by the genius of <a href="../cathen/07239a.htm">Prince Henry the Navigator</a>, Portuguese sailors passed Cape Bogador (1433), reached the Rio de Ouro (1442), doubled Cape Verde (1444), and got as far as <a href="../cathen/13783a.htm">Sierra Leone</a>. Wherever they landed the discoverers raised a <em>pedras</em>, or stone boundary-pillar, and peopled the new posts with criminals who had been condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. The Equator was crossed in 1471. Diogo Cam discovered the <a href="../cathen/04228a.htm">Congo</a> and travelled up it for 1,128 miles; Bartholomew Diaz doubled the Cape of Storms, and, finally, <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a>, who had sailed from <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, with three caravels on 8 June, 1497, and had followed the <a href="../cathen/10610a.htm">Mozambique</a> coast as far as Malindi, reached the East Indies on 20 May, 1498.

<p>Their discovery gave a great impulse to missions. Portuguese and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, French and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, gave themselves with an admirable ardour to the work of the foreign apostolate. This period witnessed the founding of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of Las Palmas in the <a href="../cathen/03243a.htm">Canary Islands</a> (1409), <a href="../cathen/06318c.htm">Funchal</a> in Madeira (1514), Sant' Iago at Cape Verde; San Thom&eacute; and <a href="../cathen/13450b.htm">San Salvador</a> (1498), afterwards transferred to Loanda. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> did wonders in <a href="../cathen/01512b.htm">Angola</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> settled at <a href="../cathen/10610a.htm">Mozambique</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of which dates from 1614; and the Augustinians took <a href="../cathen/15750c.htm">Zanzibar</a>, Mombasa, and Pat&eacute; as their sphere of labour, where they founded numerous <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities.

<p>Attempts were made at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to discover the famous <a href="../cathen/12400b.htm">Prester John</a> in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, but it was only in the seventeenth century, and for barely forty years, that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were able to establish themselves in that country, with the hope, soon destroyed by a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, of bringing back this ancient <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>.

<p>Unfortunately, however, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days were destined to blight the fair promise of the African missions. And just as <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> at the beginning of the sixteenth century had brought about irreparable <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">divisions</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and thus hindered the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the world, so now other social, political, and religious disturbances were to check for a while the colonizing activities of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> nations in the countries they had lately discovered. The sectarian policy of the <a href="../cathen/16075a.htm">Marquis de Pombal</a>, the bigotry of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> and English governments, and, lastly, the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, combined to disintegrate the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and at the same time to destroy the missions. But when the storm was over, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> set to work to build up the ruins, to make good the harm done, to take up once again her forward march on behalf of civilization.

<p>In Africa there were only a few <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and these were at the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> trading stations: St. Louis in Senegal, the French island of Goree, the Cape Verde Islands, the Cape of Good Hope, Reunion, and Mauritius. In 1839 M. de Jacobis, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Mission, with a few of his <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> brethren, had succeeded in entering <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, and in taking up, with many precautions, the old missions of the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> maintained such remnants of their missions as were left in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in Tripoli, <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>.

<p>But while the powers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> were preparing to make a final division of the African continent between them, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was making ready a new apostle for the evangelization of Africa. This work, which was to mark the close of the nineteenth century, had very lowly beginnings, and originated in America. A philanthropic association had existed in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> since 1817, whose object was to provide a neutral territory in Africa for liberated <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slaves</a>, where, under the direction of the missionaries, they might build up an independent country for themselves. The first experiment was made on Sherbro Island, to the south of <a href="../cathen/13783a.htm">Sierra Leone</a>; this, however, proved a failure. The undertaking was renewed in 1823 with better success, on a point of Cape Mesurado, which was called Monrovia, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of President Monroe, and which became the capital of <a href="../cathen/09216a.htm">Liberia</a>. In 1829, <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Bishop England</a>, of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, S.C., called the attention of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> to the undertaking, and the <a href="../cathen/02239a.htm">Second Provincial Synod of Baltimore</a>, which was to meet shortly afterwards (1833), received authority to deal with the matter. The <a href="../cathen/02239a.htm">Synod</a> decided to apply to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, but the negotiations were not carried through.

<p>The matter was finally taken in hand by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a> of Philadelphia, and at his request his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the <a href="../cathen/16007a.htm">Rev. Edward Barron</a>, was sent out, December, 1841, with the title of <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> of Upper Guinea, accompanied by the Rev. John Kelly and Denis Pindar, a catechist, all of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> origin. These missionaries arrived at Monrovia after a voyage of thirty-four days, but, finding only a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> among the emigrants, proceeded thence to Cape Palmas, where another town was being built. Its inhabitants numbered about 3,000, among whom there were eighteen <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> accordingly began his missionary labours, and having visited Cape Palmas, Elmina, and Accra, where he found hopeful traces of the ancient Spanish and Portuguese missions, went to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in search of missionaries, and to ask help of the <a href="../cathen/12461a.htm">Society for the Propagation of the Faith</a>, which had recently been founded at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominated</a> him <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Two Guineas and <a href="../cathen/13783a.htm">Sierra Leone</a> (22 January, 1842); the <a href="../cathen/12461a.htm">Society for the Propagation of the Faith</a> gave him assistance, and the Minister General of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> promised him the help of religious from the Spanish Province, one of whom was even named <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect apostolic</a>.

<p>Unforeseen delays, however, occurred, and this last arrangement was not carried out. <a href="../cathen/16007a.htm">Barron</a>, finding himself at the head of a mission without missionaries, went to the shrine of Our Lady of Victories, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them. At that very <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, the venerable <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">Father M.F. Libermann</a>, superior of a congregation recently founded for the evangelization of the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>, had several missionaries at his disposal, and had come to ask Our Lady of Victories to open to him a field of missionary labour. An agreement was quickly made, and it was thus that, under the leadership of a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> from America, the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a> were led to take up the missions of the Dark Continent. Not long afterwards, <a href="../cathen/16007a.htm">Mgr. Barron</a>, disheartened by illness and disappointment, resigned, and the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariate Apostolic</a> of the Two Guineas was entrusted to the Society of the Sacred Heart of Mary, which was soon (1848) to amalgamate with the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a>.

<p>This vicariate extended from Senegal to the Orange river, with the exception of the region, then hardly occupied, included in the Portuguese Diocese of St. Paul de Loanda. This vast country was gradually partitioned out, and there arose the present system of missions, <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefectures</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates apostolic</a>, through which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions of western Africa are conducted.

<p>The Portuguese Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/01512b.htm">Angola and Congo</a> had been maintained at Loanda, but the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> missions, properly so called, had entirely disappeared, when the daring initiative of Father Duparquet, another of the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a>, undertook their revival. In 1872 he founded a permanent post at Landana, which has become the headquarters of the Lower Congo, or Portuguese <a href="../cathen/04228a.htm">Congo</a>, Mission. In 1881, the mission of the Huilla Plateau was started, which was to extend its sphere of action beyond the Cunene; in 1884, the <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefecture Apostolic</a> of Cimbebasie included Cassinga, then Caconda, Bihe, Massaca, and Cuanyama, and reached almost as far as the basin of the Upper Zambesi. Finally, in 1887, a post was founded in Loanda itself, whence the mission passed to Malanga in 1890, and, recently, along the Congo, in the very heart of the Lunda country.

<p>A vicariate which was established, in 1837, in the Cape region to the south, to serve the needs of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> colony, has also been divided, and we now find there: the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariates Apostolic</a> of Western Cape Colony (1837); of Central Cape Colony (1874), and of Eastern Cape Colony (1847), served by English <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; the <a href="../cathen/11268a.htm">Orange River Prefecture</a>, established by the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a>, and then made over to the <a href="../cathen/11187a.htm">Oblates of St. Francis of Sales</a> at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, and recently raised to a Vicariate (1898); and lastly, the Prefectures of <a href="../cathen/02346a.htm">Basutoland</a> (1894) and the <a href="../cathen/15020a.htm">Transvaal</a> (1886); the Vicariates of the <a href="../cathen/11267a.htm">Orange Free State</a>, now <a href="../cathen/11268a.htm">Orange River Colony</a> (1886) and <a href="../cathen/10707a.htm">Natal</a> (1850), served by the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>.

<p>On the East Coast the missionary movement had its beginning in the Island of Bourbon (Reunion). Two <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a>, Father Dalmond in 1848, and Father Monnet in 1849, who had evangelized the Saint Mary Islands and the Island of Nossi-B&eacute;, were named, one after the other, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/09509e.htm">Madagascar</a>. Death, however, prevented both from settling on the mainland. The mission was, therefore, entrusted, in 1850, to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. In 1852, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Fathers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> Province were placed in charge of the Seychelles mission, which was made a vicariate in 1880. It was from Bourbon that Father Fava, one of the local <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who died, later, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, set out for <a href="../cathen/15750c.htm">Zanzibar</a> in 1860. Shortly afterwards, the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a> took possession of this East Coast and extended their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> from the Portuguese prelature of <a href="../cathen/10610a.htm">Mozambique</a> to Cape Gardafui, coming in touch in the mysterious interior of the continent with the vaguely defined boundaries which separated them from their brethren of the West Coast.

<p>The work had been begun, but more missionaries were needed to prosecute it. These came, indeed, in greater numbers than men had dared to hope. In addition to the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, founded at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> by <a href="../cathen/10094a.htm">Mgr. de Mazenod</a>, the following should be named: The Priests of the African Missions at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, founded in 1859 by Mgr.

The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, moreover, never vanquished, was resuming its old place on the Dark Continent, in that same colony, as also in the <a href="../cathen/15746c.htm">Zambesi</a> basin, and in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The Spanish Fathers of the Holy Heart of Mary had long (since 1855) been labouring in Fernando Po and its dependencies; the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> missionaries of Scheut-lez-Bruxelles had succeeded the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a> in the missions opened on the left bank of the Congo; German missionaries had followed their countrymen to Togoland, the <a href="../cathen/08596a.htm">Kameruns</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04610b.htm">Damaraland</a>, in East Africa; the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, side by side with their French brethren among the Gallas, and the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, wished to take their share of missionary labour in the conquered possessions of King Humbert in Erythr&aelig;a.

<p>In a word, the missionary movement, begun amid so many difficulties, has developed wonderfully, in every direction, and it is comforting for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to see, at the beginning of this twentieth century, the heroism with which the missionaries are assailing the Dark Continent. In order to give a comprehensive view of the religious activity there, it will be instructive to quote in a single table the various jurisdictions into which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Africa is divided, with their <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> of establishment and the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in charge of each.

<p>The most recent <a href="../cathen/14269a.htm">statistics</a>, which, unfortunately, are very far from being exact, give a total of 300,000 faithful &#151; 362,177, according to Father J.B.
