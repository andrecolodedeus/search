<h1>African Liturgy</h1>  

<p>This liturgy was in use not only in the old Roman province of Africa of which Carthage was the capital, but also in Numidia and Mauretania; in fact, in all of Northern Africa from the borders of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> west to the Atlantic Ocean. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced into proconsular Africa in the latter half of the second century, probably by missionaries from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and then spread rapidly through the other African provinces. The language of the liturgy was Latin, modified somewhat by the introduction of many Africanisms. It is probably the oldest Latin liturgy, since it had been in use long before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> changed her official language from the Greek to the Latin idiom. A study of the African liturgy might thus be very useful to trace the origin and development of the different rites, and to determine what influence one rite had upon another. Since the <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">African Church</a> was always dependent upon <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, always devoted to the See of St. Peter, and since there was constant communication between Africa and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, it may easily be supposed that <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> questions were raised, different customs discussed, and possibly the customs or formulas of one church adopted by the other. At a later date the African liturgy would seem to have exercised some influence upon the Mozarabic and Gallican <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. The great similarity in some of the phraseology, etc., would show a common origin or a mutual dependence of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. The African liturgy may be considered in two different periods: the ante-Nicene period, when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was suffering <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and could not freely develop the forms of public worship, and when the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and acts had not become fixed; and the post-Nicene period, when the simple, improvised forms of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> gave way to more elaborate, set formularies, and the primitive <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> actions evolved into grand and formal ceremonies.
<h2 id="section1">Ante-Nicene period</h2>

<p>It is a difficult matter to reconstruct the ancient African liturgy since there are so few available data; for instance, owing to the ravages of time and of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, no <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> now survive; in the works of the early Fathers or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, and in the acts of the councils there are but few quotations from the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>, and not many references to the words or ceremonies of the liturgy. In the first, or ante-Nicene period, it may be said there were only two writers who furnish useful information on the subject--<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>. The writings of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> are especially rich in descriptions of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> customs, or in clear allusions to existing rites and usages. Some additional information may be gained from the acts of the early <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, e.g. the Acts of St. Perpetua and <a href="../cathen/06028a.htm">St. Felicitas</a>, which are quite authentic and authoritative. Finally, the inscriptions on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments give much confirmatory evidence on the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices of the time. From these various sources one may learn some of the customs which were peculiar to the African Church, and what formularies and ceremonies were common to all the Western churches. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were either private or <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>. Privately they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> every morning and evening, and many of them <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> frequently during the day; for example, at the third, sixth, and ninth hours, before meals, and before undertaking any unusual work or enterprise. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were said chiefly during the reunions of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to observe the vigils, or to celebrate the agape and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. These <a href="../cathen/14383a.htm">Christian assemblies</a> in Africa seem to have been modelled on the same plan as those in other countries. They imitated, in a certain measure, the services of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, adding thereto the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Eucharistic sacrifice</a> and some institutions peculiar to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. In these reunions three elements are easily distinguishable: psalmody, the reading of passages from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, to which a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on the Scripture was generally added. Such meetings were sometimes distinct from the Mass, but sometimes they formed a preparation for the celebration of the divine mysteries. The elders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> presided over the assembly, instructions and exhortations were given, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> recited for the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the necessities of the brethren were considered and provided for, and various business pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community was transacted; and finally, the agape was celebrated as a fitting conclusion to a reunion of the disciples of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The agape seems to have been celebrated in Africa in the same manner as in other countries, and to have degenerated into an abuse to be suppressed here, as well as elsewhere.

<p>These <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> meetings generally took place at night, or just before dawn, and hence <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> speaks of such an assembly as a <em>coetus antelucanus</em>, a "meeting before the dawn" (Apol., ii), while others speak of it as a vigil. Possibly the hour was chosen to commemorate the time of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of the Lord</a>, or perhaps it was selected to enable the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in times of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> to evade their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Christian liturgy</a>, in a strict sense of the word, is the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, the sacrifice of the New Law. This generally followed the long <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of a vigil, and even today some traces of the vigil survive, since a similarity may easily be noticed between the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the ancient vigils, and the first, or preparatory part of the Mass; or perhaps even more clearly in the first part of the Masses for the Ember days, or the Mass of the Pre-sanctified on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> was celebrated very early in the morning ordinarily, and the regular day chosen for assisting at the sacrifice and partaking of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> was the Sunday, in commemoration of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was not observed by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the Jewish sense, and the Jewish festivals were also abandoned, as is evident from the words of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De idolatria, xiv), speaking of the observance of festivals by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, "to whom <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> are strange, and the new-moons and festivals formerly beloved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". The Sunday was now the Lord's day, a day of rejoicing, on which it was forbidden to fast and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in a kneeling posture. "We count <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or kneeling in worship on the Lord's day to be unlawful". (Tert., De corona, iii.)



<p>When Sunday was thus kept in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> it was only natural that Friday should be considered the appropriate day for <a href="../cathen/11526a.htm">commemorating the passion and death of Christ</a> and hence the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> met for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on Friday. There was also a reunion on Wednesdays, whose origin cannot be satisfactorily accounted for. The Wednesday and Friday meetings were known to <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> by the name of stations (<em>stationes</em>). In Africa it appears to have been the custom to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> on <a href="../cathen/14268a.htm">station days</a>, although it does not seem to have been the practice in other churches. Everywhere these were days of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, but as the fast lasted only until the ninth hour, the liturgy would be celebrated and communion distributed about that time in the afternoon. Of all the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, the feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> was the greatest, and was celebrated with special solemnity. <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, called by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> "Pascha", was a day of strict fast, which was prolonged through <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>. This latter day was only a day for the preparation for the feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>; but still it was the most solemn vigil during the year, and the one on which all the vigils were modelled. <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> does not seem to have had any special <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> service assigned, the present service being the ancient <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter vigil</a> anticipated. Possibly the <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">vigil of Easter</a> was observed so solemnly on account of the tradition that the Lord would return to judge the world on the feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> hoped He would find them watching. <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> in <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> time was followed by a period of fifty days' rejoicing until Pentecost, which was considered as the close of the <a href="../cathen/11516a.htm">Easter season</a> rather than as a solemn feast with a special significance. In the third century <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, as a period of forty days' <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, was unknown in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. Of the greater immovable feasts the earlier writers appear to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing; hence <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, the Circumcision, the Epiphany, the festivals of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and the feasts of the Apostles do not seem to have been celebrated. The festivals of local <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> seem to have taken precedence over what are now regarded as the greatest feasts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and their anniversaries were celebrated long before the great immovable feasts were introduced. Such celebrations were purely local, and it was only at a much later date that commemorations of foreign <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were made. The early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had a great devotion towards the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and confessors of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, carefully preserved and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, made <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, and sought to be buried as near as possible to the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and hence the anniversaries of the local <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were celebrated with great solemnity. Thus the calendar of the African Church in the ante-Nicene period was rather restricted, and contained but a comparatively small number of feast days.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions, the celebration of Mass, or of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, occupies the most important place. Although the early writers speak in a guarded manner concerning these sacred mysteries, still they give much precious information on the liturgy of their age. The Mass seems to have been divided into the Mass of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, and the Mass of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and among the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> were rigidly excluded from assisting at the sacrifice proper. Bread and wine are used as the matter of the sacrament, but a little water is added to the wine to signify the union of the people with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> severely condemns certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who used only water in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, declaring that water is not the essential matter of the sacrifice, and its exclusive use renders the sacrament invalid. Both <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> have passages which seem to give the form of the Eucharist in the very words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as quoted in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. Sometimes there is great similarity between their words and the phraseology of the Roman canon. There are allusions to the Preface, the Sanctus, the commemoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Pater noster, and to different acclamations. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> speaks often of the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>, and considers the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> very important. References are also made to a <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> which was recited during the Mass, but no precise information is given concerning its place in the liturgy. At Mass the faithful received communion under both species, under the species of bread from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and under the species of wine from the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and each one, after receiving communion, answered "Amen" to profess his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the sacrament. Sometimes the faithful carried the Host home, and there communicated themselves, especially in times of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Communion seems to have been received <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, as <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> implies when he inquires what a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> husband will think of the food of which his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> wife partakes before any other food. The early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> appear to have communicated frequently, even every day, especially during a period of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The greatest reverence was shown to the Sacred Species, so the faithful strove to be free from all stain of grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and deemed it a serious fault to allow any of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> elements to fall to the ground.

<p>Baptism, as the initiatory rite of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, is mentioned frequently by the early writers; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> wrote a special treatise on this sacrament, describing the preparation required for it, and the ceremonies accompanying it. The <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> should prepare for the reception of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by frequent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, and vigils. Although he usually speaks of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of adults, still he admits the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants, but seems to be somewhat opposed to this practice, which was commended by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>. The time set for the solemn administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, or any day between <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Pentecost, but <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> declares that as every day belongs to the Lord it might be conferred at any time. He holds that it should be administered by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who, however, may delegate a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to act in his place, although in certain cases he would permit <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Any kind of water may serve as the matter of the sacrament, and the water is used to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> "in the name of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and of the Holy Ghost". The mode of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> was by triple immersion in the font, which had already been blessed. Many beautiful symbolical ceremonies accompanied the rite of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Before the candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> entered the font he renounced the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with his pomps and his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">angels</a>. There was also a creed to be recited by the candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, probably an African form of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> gives several different forms of this <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a> ascended from the font he received a drink of milk and honey, and was then anointed with <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> oil. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> also states that the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a> was signed with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, that he received the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> with the invocation of the Holy Ghost, and that the newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> then partook of his first holy communion. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> explains many of these ceremonies in his treatise on the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (viii). "The flesh indeed is washed in order that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be cleansed; the flesh is anointed, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; the flesh is signed (with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> too may be fortified; the flesh is shadowed with the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also may be illuminated by the spirit; the flesh feeds on the Body and Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> likewise may fatten on its <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>The testimonies relating to the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> describe principally the public penances imposed for grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of the penitents after the public penances had been performed to the satisfaction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> at first asserted that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had the power of forgiving all kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but after becoming a <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a> he denied that this power extended to certain most heinous crimes, and then ridiculed the practice of the Pope and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, who denied <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> to no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> that was truly penitent for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. In writing sarcastically of the mode of procedure in use at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/03183d.htm">Pope St. Callixtus</a>, he probably gives a good description of the manner in which a penitent sinner was absolved and readmitted into communion with the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. He narrates how the penitent, "clothed in a <a href="../cathen/07113b.htm">hair-shirt</a> and covered with <a href="../cathen/01776c.htm">ashes</a>, appears before the assembly of the faithful craving <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, how he prostrates himself before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, seizes the hem of their garments, <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kisses</a> their footprints, clasps them by the knees", how the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the meantime, addresses the people, exhorting them by the recital of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the lost sheep to be merciful and show pity to the poor penitent who asks for pardon. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the penitents, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> imposed hands upon them as a sign of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and restoration into the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Although <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> in these words wished to throw ridicule on what he deemed excessive laxity at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, still he describes faithfully rites which seem to have been in use in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Africa also, since elsewhere in his writings he mentions doing penance in sack-cloth and ashes, of weeping for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and of asking the forgiveness of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> also writes of the different acts of penance, of the confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, of the manner in which the public penance was performed, of the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> given by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of the hands</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> through which the penitents regained their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> speaks of the nuptial blessing pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriage of Christians</a>, asking "how he could sufficiently extol the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of that marriage which is cemented by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, confirmed by the oblation, sealed with the benediction, which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> proclaim, which is ratified by the Heavenly Father". <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a> thus seems to have been celebrated publicly before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with more or less solemnity, but the nuptial blessing would appear to have been optional and not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, except perhaps by force of custom.

<p>Both <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> mention <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and the various orders in the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>, but unfortunately do not give much information which is strictly <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> whose powers and functions are pretty well defined, who are chosen on account of their exemplary conduct by the brethren, and are then <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by regular <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Only those who are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, says <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and grant pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> distinguishes the different orders, mentioning <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, sub-deacons, <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, and in describing the election of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">St. Cornelius</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> declares that <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> was promoted from one order to another until finally he was elected by the votes of all to the supreme pontificate. All the orders except the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor order</a> of ostiary are enumerated by the early African writers. Both <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a> and <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a> appear to have occupied a much more important <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> position in the early ages than in later times. The <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>, for example, was frequently called upon to exercise the power he had received at <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> speaks of this extraordinary power which was exercised in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Christ</a>. Sometimes the <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a> used the rite of exsufflation, and sometimes, as <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> states, adjured the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> to depart <em>per Deum verum</em> (by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>). Lectors also had many <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions to perform. The <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>, for example, recited the lessons from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>, and even read the Gospel from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> to the people. In later ages his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were divided, and some were given to the other <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, some to regular chanters.

<p>Among other <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> ceremonies the early writers often allude to the rites accompanying the burial of the dead, and particularly the entombment of the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and confessors. From the earliest times the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> showed great reverence to the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, embalmed them with <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and spices, and buried them carefully in distinctively <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cemeteries. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> were said <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">for the repose of the souls of the dead</a>, Masses were offered especially on the anniversary of death and their names were recited in the Memento of the Mass, provided that they had lived in accordance with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideals. The faithful were taught not to mourn for their dead, but to rejoice that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed were already living with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and enjoying peace and refreshing <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> after their earthly trials and labours. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, and the Acts of St. Perpetua, all give testimony to the antiquity of these customs. The cemeteries in Africa (called <em>areae</em>) were not <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> like those in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but above ground in the open air, and often had a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> (<em>cella</em>) adjoining them, where the reunions of the faithful took place on the anniversaries of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and of the other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who were buried there. The inscriptions on the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> often state that the departed had lived a life of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peace, <em>in pace vixit</em>, or often beautifully express their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope of the faithful in a future life of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> together with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>--<em>spes in Deo--in Deo vivas</em>.

<p>Finally, some ceremonial acts might be considered to which reference is often made by the early writers. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> were said sometimes kneeling, sometimes standing; for example, on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, and during the fifty days following <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, it was forbidden to kneel, while on fast days the kneeling posture was considered appropriate. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with the arms stretched out somewhat in the form of a cross. The <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> was made very frequently, often on some object with the intention of blessing it, often on the forehead of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to invoke <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> protection and assistance. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> in his "De Corona" writes: "At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>". The early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were also accustomed to strike their breasts in sign of guilt and contrition for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> believed that the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> should be given often; in fact, that it should accompany every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Not only are there many ceremonial acts such as those just mentioned which existed in the third century and have been preserved even to the present in the liturgy, but there are also many phrases and acclamations of the <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">early African Church</a> which have found a permanent place in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> formularies. These expressions, and perhaps also the measured style in which they were composed, may have had considerable influence in the development of the other Latin <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Post-Nicene period</h2>

<p>After the edict of Constantine granting freedom of worship to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, and especially after the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, there was a great development in the liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was only natural that for some time after the foundation of the new religion, its liturgy should contain only the essentials of <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>, and that in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> it should develop and expand its ritual according to the needs of the people. Moreover, the first period was an age of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and hence the ceremonial was necessarily curtailed. But when <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> ceased, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> began immediately to expand her ceremonial, changing and modifying the old forms and introducing new rites according to the requirements of public <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> worship, so that the liturgy would be more dignified, more magnificent, and more impressive. In the beginning great liberty was allowed the individual celebrant to improvise the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the liturgy, provided that he adhered to the strict form in essentials and followed the theme demanded, but at a later date the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> felt the need of a set of formularies and fixed ceremonies, lest dogmatic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> should find expression in the liturgy and thus corrupt the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the people. In the fourth century all these tendencies to expansion and development are very noticeable in all the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, also, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Africa in the second period of the history of the African liturgy which embraces the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries to the beginning of the eighth century, when <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">Christianity in Africa</a> was practically destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>. No <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> or <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> belonging to this period are extant, so the liturgy must be reconstructed from contemporary writings and monuments. Of the writers of the period <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> is richest in allusions to ceremonies and formularies, but <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a>, Marius Victorinus, Arnobius, and Victor Vitensis give some useful information. The inscriptions, which are more numerous in this period, and the archaeological discoveries also furnish some <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> data.

<p>The beginning of a real <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> calendar, with definitely fixed feasts and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, now appears. The great feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, upon which all the movable feasts depended, is celebrated with even greater solemnity than in the time of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. Before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> there was a period of forty days' preparation, devoted to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and other works of penance. The vigil of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> was celebrated with the usual ritual, but the length of the offices seems to have been increased. The Paschal solemnity was followed by a season of fifty days' rejoicing until Pentecost day, which, in the fourth century, appears to have a distinctive character as the commemoration of the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles rather than as the close of the <a href="../cathen/11516a.htm">Easter season</a>. In <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> commemorated the institution of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, and according to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, besides the morning Mass, a Mass was also celebrated in the evening in order to carry out all the circumstances of the institution at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>. <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> was observed by attending the long <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> offices, while <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> was celebrated in about the same manner as in the time of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension Day</a> seems to have been introduced in the fourth century, but in the time of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> it was universally observed. As for the immovable feasts, <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and Epiphany, which were unknown to <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, were celebrated with the greatest solemnity in the fifth century. The first of January was observed not as the feast of the Circumcision, but as a fast day which had been instituted for the purpose of turning the people away from the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> festivities which took place at that time of the year. Feasts of other than local <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were introduced, for instance, immediately after <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, the feast of <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">St. Stephen</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a> and of Sts. John and James, and later in the year, the feasts of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, of Sts. Peter and Paul, of the Maccabees, of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, St. Vincent, etc. The festivals of the local <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were celebrated with even greater solemnity than in early times, and were often accompanied by feasting which was frequently condemned in the sermons of the time, on account of abuses. When such a large number of feasts was annually observed, it was to be expected that a list or calendar would be drawn up, and, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a calendar was drawn up for the use of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Carthage in the beginning of the sixth century, from which very important information concerning the institution and history of the great feast days may be obtained. When <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> received legal recognition in the Empire, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> began to construct churches and adorn them fittingly to serve their purpose. Most of these were built in the old basilica style, with some few differences. The churches were dedicated in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> frequently, and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were placed beneath the altars. The inscriptions of the period mention the dedication to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and also the fact that the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were placed in the church or in the altar. The altar itself, called mensa (table), was generally made of wood, but sometimes of stone, and was covered over with linen cloths. There was a special rite for dedicating churches and also for consecrating altars, in which blessed water and the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> were used.

<p>The Mass became a daily function celebrated every morning when the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> could meet frequently without fear of persecuting, and when the increased number of feasts required a more frequent celebration of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> offices. Little is known with precision and certitude of the composition of the different parts of the Mass, but still there are many allusions in various authors which give some valuable information. The Mass of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> consisted of psalms and lessons from the Scriptures. These lessons were chosen from both the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>, and it would seem that there were three lessons as in some of the Oriental <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, one from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, one from the Epistles in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and one from the Gospels. The Third <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> decreed that only lessons from the canonical books of Scripture or from the acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> on their feast days might be read in the churches. Between the Epistle and Gospel a psalm containing some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in harmony with the feast of the day was recited, and corresponded to the gradual or tract in the Roman Mass. An <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">alleluia</a> was also sung, more or less solemnly, especially on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and during the <a href="../cathen/11516a.htm">fifty days' prolongation of the Easter festival</a>. The lessons from the Scriptures were generally followed by a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a>, after which both the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and the penitents were dismissed, and the Mass of the faithful commenced. This rule of dismissing the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, etc., seems to have been strictly observed, since nearly all the African writers in their sermons or other works use expressions which indicate that their words would be intelligible only to the initiated, and that the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the mysteries celebrated in the Mass of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> may have been recited after the Gospel, although its precise position cannot be determined with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> consisted of short petitions for the various needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, resembling somewhat the petitions in the present <a href="../cathen/09291a.htm">Litany of the Saints</a>, or perhaps the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for different classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or necessities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which are now recited on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>. The people very probably responded with some acclamation like <em>Kyrie eleison</em>, or <em>Te rogamus audi nos</em>.

<p>In the time of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> a chant for the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> was introduced in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Carthage; it consisted of a psalm having some reference to the oblation, and was sung while the people were making their offerings. Each of the faithful was supposed to bring an offering for his communion. The offerings were received by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and placed upon the altar, with the appropriate <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> proceeded with the Mass. The <em>Dominus vobiscum</em> preceded the Preface, which properly began with the words <em>Sursum corda, Habemos ad Dominum, Gratias agamus Domino Deo nostro, Dignum et justum est</em>. The <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">canon of the Mass</a> was known in Africa as the <em>actio</em>, or <em>agenda</em>, and was mentioned but very seldom on account of the <a href="../cathen/05032a.htm">"discipline of the secret"</a>. There are, however, some passages in the African writers which show that there was a great similarity between the African <em>actio</em> and the Roman canon, so much so that some of the texts when put in juxtaposition are almost identical. The <em>actio</em> contained the usual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the commemoration for the living and the dead, the words of institution and sanctification of the sacrifice, the commemoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a>, and the preparation for Communion. The <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a> seems to have held the same position that it now has in the Roman canon, and it was said before the Communion, as St. Augustine states, because in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> we beseech <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to forgive our offences, and thus we may approach the communion table with better dispositions. The <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> followed shortly after the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a>, and was closely connected with the Communion, being regarded as a symbol of the fraternal union existing between all those who partook of the Body and Blood of Christ. The faithful received communion frequently, and were encouraged in the practice of receiving daily communion. At the proper time the communicants approached the altar and there partook of the Eucharist under both species, answering "Amen" to the formula pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in order to profess their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the sacrament just received. During the distribution of communion the thirty-third psalm was recited or sung, because that psalm contained some verses considered appropriate for the Communion. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> of thanksgiving were then said, and the people dismissed from the church with a benediction.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> accompanying the administration of the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> seem to have become more fixed and to have lengthened since the time of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. For the more decorous and convenient administration of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a>, large <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptisteries</a> were erected, in which the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was carried out with great solemnity. The African Church seems to have followed practically the same ritual as the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> during the catechumenate, which lasted for the forty days preceding <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, for instance, speaks of teaching the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, and of the rites for the <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Vigil of Easter</a>, as if they were in accord with those in use at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but there appears to be only one unction, that after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is still given as in the days of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>. Victor Vitensis asserts that the African Church admitted the feast of the Epiphany as a day appointed for the solemn administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> according to the custom prevailing in Oriental churches. The <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> were confirmed after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> through the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and the unction with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> on the forehead in the form of a cross, and on the same day they seem to have received their first holy communion with about the same ceremonies as in the ante-Nicene period. The rite for the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> shows few peculiarities in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, so public penances were imposed and the reconciliation of penitents was effected in the same manner as in the age of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>.

<p>Matrimony is often mentioned, especially by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, who speaks of the nuptial blessing and the various other ceremonies, civil and religious, connected with it, as for instance the tabulae nuptiales, etc.

<p>As the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Sacrament of Holy Orders</a> had a more public character like the Eucharist, it is frequently alluded to in the writings and inscriptions of the time. Allusions are made to the various orders and to <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, but there is scarcely ever a description of the rite of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, or an explanation of the formulas. It might be noted that the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> now appears and has special functions assigned to him. Clerics began their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career as <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a> often at a tender age, and the <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a> formed a <em>schola</em> (school), which sang the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices. Later on, the <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a> became chanters, and their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were given to the other <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> also speaks frequently of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of virgins, which seems to have been reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The veil might be received at a much younger age in Africa than at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>The faithful showed the same loving care and respect to the bodies of the departed as in the ante-Nicene period, but now the funeral rites were longer and more solemn. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> were said <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">for the dead</a>, Mass was offered for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed, and special rites took place while the funeral procession was on the way and when the body was entombed. The names of the dead were recited in the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, and Mass was offered for them on the anniversaries of death. Moreover, the inscriptions of this age contain beautiful sentiments of hope in a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> future life for those who had lived and died in the peace of the Lord, and beseech <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to grant eternal rest and beatitude to those who trust in His mercy. Many of these expressions are very similar to the phrases now used in the obsequies of the dead.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> was gradually developing, but was still in a very rudimentary state. It consisted of the recitation or chanting of psalms and canticles, of versicles and acclamations, and the reading of portions of the Scriptures. There was a special collection of canticles taken from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> in use in the African Church, and perhaps, also, a collection of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> composed by uninspired writers, in which were the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>. Many of the versicles quoted in the writings of the time may be now found in the present Roman liturgy. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was evidently opposed to the growing tendency to abandon the simple recitative tone and make the chant of the offices more solemn and ornate as the ceremonial became more formal. Gradually the formularies became more fixed, and liberty to improvise was curtailed by the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">African councils</a>. Few, however, of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> have been preserved, although many shorter verses and acclamations have been quoted in the writings of the period, as for example, the <em><a href="../cathen/04737a.htm">Deo Gratias</a>, Deo Laudes</em>, and <em>Amen</em>, with which the people approved the words of the preacher, or the doxologies and conclusions of some of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The people still used the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> frequently in their <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">private devotions</a> as in the days of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. Other ceremonial acts in common use were striking the breast as a sign of penance, extending the arms in the form of a cross, kneeling during <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, etc., all of which had been handed down from primitive times. Such are some of the most important data furnished by the early writers and inscriptions concerning the liturgy of the African Church, and they are useful to show the peculiarities of the Latin rite in Africa as well as the similarity between the African and other <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>.
