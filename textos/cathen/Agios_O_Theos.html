<h1>Agios O Theos</h1>  

<p>(O Holy God).

<p>The opening words in Greek of an invocation, or <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>&mdash;for it may properly receive any of these titles&mdash;which in the Roman Liturgy is sung during the <em>Improperia,</em> or "Reproaches" at the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the Adoration of the Cross, on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>. The brief <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is then sung by two choirs alternately in Greek and Latin, as follows: First Choir: <em>Agios o Theos</em> (O Holy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>). Second Choir: <em>Sanctus Deus.</em> First Choir: <em>Agios ischyros</em> (Holy, Strong). Second Choir: <em>Sanctus fortis.</em> First Choir: <em>Agios athanatos, eleison imas</em> (Holy, Immortal, have mercy on us). Second Choir: <em>Sanctus immortalis, miserere nobis.</em> Thus the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> appears in the Office of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, with the Greek words <em>'&#193;gios &oacute; the&#242;s, '&aacute;gios &#236;skhur&#242;s, '&#193;gios &#224;th&aacute;natos &#232;l&eacute;eson &#232;m&#226;s</em> expressed in Latinized characters, chosen to represent the Greek pronunciation (e.g. <em>eleison imas</em> for <em>ele&eacute;son &eacute;mas</em>, the aspirate, as in modern Greek, remaining unheard). The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is thus sung twelve times, alternating with a series of varied "Reproaches".

<p>From the Latin word <em>Sanctus</em> thrice said, the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is sometimes referred to as <em>Tersanctus,</em> and is thus apt to be confused with the triple Sanctus at the end of the preface at Mass. In the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the Greek Liturgy, in which the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is said very frequently, it is always referred to as the <em>Trisagion</em> (<em>tr&#237;s</em> thrice, <em>'&aacute;gios</em> = holy), and is thus generally and properly known. It is sung at the Lesser Entrance, or solemn processional carrying of the book of the Gospels at Mass, in the Constantinopolitan and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> and in that of St. Mark. In the Gallican Liturgy it was placed both before and after the Gospel. The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is certainly of great antiquity, and perhaps much older than the event assigned by the Greek <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">Menology</a> as its origin. The legend, which may be considered a highly improbable one, recounts that during the reign of the younger Theodosius (408-450), Constantinople was shaken by a violent earthquake, 24 September, and that whilst the people, the Emperor, and the Patriarch Proclus (434-446) were <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for heavenly succour, a child was suddenly lifted into mid-air, to whom forthwith all cried out <em>Kyrie eleison;</em> and that the child, returning again to earth, admonished the people with a loud voice to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> thus: "O Holy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Holy and Strong, Holy and Immortal", and immediately expired. The fact that the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> was one of the exclamations of the Fathers at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451), and that not only is it common to all the Greek Oriental <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, but was used also in the Gallican Liturgy [<a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, (d. 576), referring to it as being sung both in Greek and in Latin: "Incipiente pr&aelig;sule ecclesia Ajus (that is, <em>Agios</em>) psallit, dicens latinum cum gr&aelig;co", as also previously in Greek alone, before the <em>Prophetia</em>] suggests from such a widespread and apparently common use the conclusion that the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is extremely ancient, perhaps of apostolic origin. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> thought that the Greek formula was joined with the Latin in allusion to the divine voice heard at Constantinople. But the explanation seems hardly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in view of the retention of <em>Kyrie eleison</em> in the Roman Liturgy, as well as of such Hebrew words as <em>Amen, <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a>, <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">Sabaoth</a></em>. Reverence for antiquity, and the influence of liturgy upon liturgy, would suffice to explain the Greek form. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <em>Kyrie eleison</em> is not joined to a Latin version. On the other hand, it is so simple and occurs so frequently, that its meaning could easily be learned and remembered; whereas the <em>Trisagion,</em> elaborate and rarely used, might well receive a parallel version into Latin. Various additions made to it from time to time in the East have either disfigured its simplicity or endangered its <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. Thus, the phrase "Who wast crucified for us", added to it by Peter the Fuller, in order to spread the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Theopaschites (who asserted that the Divine Nature suffered upon the cross), while susceptible of a correct interpretation, was inserted nevertheless with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> intent. Traditionally, the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> had always been addressed to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> (<a href="../bible/isa006.htm#vrs3">Isaiah 6:3</a>). Subsequently, Calandion, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, sought both to allay the tumults aroused by the addition and to remove its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suggestion by prefixing to it the words "Christ, King", thus making it refer directly and unequivocally to the Incarnate Word: "O Holy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Holy and Strong, Holy and Immortal, <em>Christ, King, Who wast crucified for us,</em> have mercy on us." His well-meant effort did not succeed, and his emendation was rejected. Subsequently, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Severus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, wrote to prove the correct ascription of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and made the use of the addition general in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (1073-85f) wrote to the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, who still used the new formula, bidding them avoid all occasion of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> and suspicion of wrong interpretation, by cancelling a formula which neither the Roman nor any <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, save the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, had adopted. The injunction seems to have been disregarded; for when, centuries after, union with the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> was again discussed, a question was addressed (30 January, 1635) to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, whether the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> might still use the formula "Who suffered for us", and was answered negatively. Variations of the traditional formula and Trinitarian ascription are found in the Armeno-Gregorian rite. These are addressed to the Redeemer, and vary with the feast or office. Thus, the formula of Peter is used on all Fridays; on all <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>: "Thou that didst arise from the dead"; on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>: "Thou that wast betrayed for us"; on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>: "Thou that wast buried for us"; on the Feast of the Assumption: "Thou that didst come to the death of the Holy Mother and Virgin", etc. The Armeno-Roman rite has suppressed all of these variations. The <em>Trisagion</em> is sung in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> at all the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a> and several times during the long Mass-service. In the Latin church it is sung only on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, as we have seen. Sung throughout the impressive <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the Adoration of the Cross, the polyphonic musical setting of <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a> for both the "Reproaches" and the <em>Trisagion,</em> assuredly a masterpiece, perhaps the masterpiece of that prince of church song, adds an overpowering pathos of music to the words, and constitutes, like the Hallelujah Chorus of Handel, a marvel of simplicity achieving a marvellous effect.
