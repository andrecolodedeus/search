<h1>Agnolo, Giovanni, and Taddeo Gaddi</h1>  

<p>Florentine artists, Taddeo being the father of Agnolo and Giovanni. The dates of their birth are very uncertain. Taddeo was probably born about 1300; Agnolo and Giovanni after 1333. The father died in 1366, Giovanni in 1383, Agnolo in 1396, and all three are buried in Santa Croce in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. Taddeo was the godson of <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>, lived with him twenty-four years, and became the most eminent of his numerous scholars. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> says that he "surpassed his master in colour", and, in some of his works, "even in expression". Two <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> signed by him are in existence &mdash; one in <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1333, and another in the church of Mogognano, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1355. The best of his extant frescoes are those in the Giugni Chapel, formerly belonging to the Baroncelli <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, in the church of Santa Croce, but his most extensive works, in the churches of San Spirito and the Serviti, have all disappeared. Many of his frescoes and several of his most celebrated altar-pieces have entirely disappeared. His principal work was in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, but he also executed several examples in <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a> and in the Casentino. Perhaps he is best known for the fact that he was a distinguished architect, and designed the present Ponte Vecchio in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and also lower down the river a still finer bridge (Ponte Trinita), which was destroyed in the sixteenth century. He was very successful, and amassed great wealth.

<p>His son Agnolo entered the studios of Giovanni da Milano and Jacopo del Casentino; his best work is in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a>, where there are thirteen frescoes illustrating the story of the Holy Girdle, and in the church of Santa Croce at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where there are eight panels by him, commemorating the legend of the Cross. His earliest work, according to <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, illustrated the story of Christ raising Lazarus, and was regarded as the most wonderful <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of a dead body that had ever been seen. He was the master of an even more celebrated man, Cennino Cennini, the author of an important treatise on <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in fresco, distemper, and other media, which is the chief source of our information respecting the technic of the early Florentine artists, and also of a book, the importance of which, especially with regard to tempera <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and the application of gold, can hardly be over-estimated. Giovanni Gaddi, the brother and pupil of Agnolo, was a man of much less importance, and hardly any works now remain which can be attributed to him with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, as in the rebuilding of San Spirito at Florence most of his work was destroyed.
