<h1>Agnus Dei</h1>  

<p>The name <em>Agnus Dei</em> has been given to certain discs of wax impressed with the figure of a lamb and blessed at stated seasons by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. They are sometimes round, sometimes oval in diameter. The lamb usually bears a cross or flag, while figures of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or the name and arms of the Pope are also commonly impressed on the reverse. These Agnus Deis may be worn suspended round the neck, or they may be preserved as objects of devotion. In virtue of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> they receive, they are regarded, like <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, blessed palms, etc., as "Sacramentals".
<h2>Origin</h2>

<p>The origin of Agnus Deis is a matter of much obscurity. Recent authorities lay stress upon the lack of evidence for their existence before the ninth century. But it seems probable that they had their beginning in some <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> usage of charms or amulets, from which the ruder populace were weaned by the enjoyment of this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> substitute blessed by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The early history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ceremonial affords numerous parallels for this Christianizing of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rites. It is not disputed that the Agnus Deis originated in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. If so, we may probably trace the custom back to the final overthrow of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a> in that city, say the fifth century. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that when we first hear of them (c. 820) they were made of the remnants of the preceding year's <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candle</a>. We also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from <a href="../cathen/05478a.htm">Ennodius</a> (c. 510) that fragments of the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candles</a> were used as a protection against tempests and blight (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LXIII, pp. 259, 262). It is also possible that a mention of the blessing of wax under <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> (418) in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (first edition) should be interpreted, with Mgr. Duchesne, of the Agnus Dei, though it more probably refers to the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candle</a>. It was at this period and before the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan Council of 691</a> that the symbolism of the Lamb most flourished; see the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus. The alleged examples of early Agnus Deis, e.g. one of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> in the treasury of Monza (see Kraus, "Real-Encyclopadie," s.v.) cannot be trusted. The earliest certain specimen now in existence seems to belong to the time of <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> (1370).
<h2>History</h2>

<p>From the time of Amalarius (c. 820) onwards we find frequent mention of the use of Agnus Deis. At a later period they were often sent by the Popes as presents to sovereigns and distinguished personages. A famous letter in verse accompanied the Agnus Dei despatched by <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> to the Emperor John Palaeologus in 1366. In the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> of Queen Elizabeth Agnus Deis are frequently mentioned among other "popish trumperies" the importation of which into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was rigorously forbidden.
<h2>Blessing and distribution</h2>

<p>We learn from an "Ordo Romanus" printed by Muratori ("Lit. Rom", II, p. 1,004) that in the ninth century the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> manufactured the Agnus Deis early on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> morning out of clean wax mixed with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, and that they were distributed by him to the people on the Saturday following (Sabbato in Albis). At a later date the Pope himself generally assisted at both the blessing and the distribution. The great <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Agnus Deis took place only in the first year of each pontificate and every seventh year afterwards, which rule is still followed. The discs of wax are now prepared beforehand by certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and without the use of <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>. On the Wednesday of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> week these discs are brought to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, who dips them into a vessel of water mixed with <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> and balsam, adding various consecratory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The distribution takes place with solemnity on the Saturday following, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, after the "Agnus Dei" of the Mass, puts a packet of Agnus Deis into the inverted <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> of each <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who comes up to receive them.
<h2>Symbolism and use</h2>

<p>The symbolism of the Agnus Deis is best gathered from the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> used at various epochs in blessing them. As in the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candle</a>, the wax typifies the virgin flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the cross associated with the lamb suggests the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a victim offered in sacrifice, and as the blood of the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">paschal lamb</a> of old protected each household from the destroying <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, so the purpose of these <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medallions</a> is to protect those who wear or possess them from all malign influences. In the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of blessing, special mention is made of the perils from storm and pestilence, from fire and flood, and also of the dangers to which <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are exposed in childbirth. It was formerly the custom in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to accompany the gift of an Agnus Dei with a printed leaflet describing its many virtues. <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miraculous</a> effects have been believed to follow the use of these objects of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Fires are said to have been extinguished, and floods stayed. The manufacture of counterfeits, and even the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and ornamentation of genuine Agnus Deis, has been strictly prohibited by various <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> bulls.
<h2>Martyrs' paste</h2>

<p>There are also Agnus Deis of a grey colour, made from wax mingled with the dust which is believed to be that of the bones of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. These, which are called "Paste de' SS. Martiri", are held to need no special <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and are treated as <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>.
