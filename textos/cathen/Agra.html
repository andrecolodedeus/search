<h1>Agra</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a>; it is situated in British <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and lies between 25&#176;30' and 32' N. lat., and 75&#176; and 81&#176; E. long. The area in square miles is 91,843. The population, according to the last census, is 28,086,364. The predominant religion of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> when missions were first introduced was <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>. The primitive religion is <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a>. The bulk of the population then, as now, belonged to this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. The Archdiocese of Agra is an outcome of the Tibet Mission, which was the first regularly established in this part of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. Pellegrino da Forli in his "Annali dei Cappuccini", IV, 115, states: "Since 1703 the Sacred Congregation of the <em>Propagation of the Faith</em> has assigned to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Marca d'Ancona</a> the Mission of Tibet". The first <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation which refers to the Tibetan Mission is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 11 January, this instrument Father Felix, a Montecchio of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Order</a>, is appointed Missionary Apostolic for ten years under the Prefect John Francis a <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Ordin. F. Min. Cap. S. Francisci, t. VII, 250). From 1704 to 1808 thirty hands of missionaries, varying in number from two or three to eleven or twelve, were sent out. Owing to the unsettled condition of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, none were sent, from 1808 to 1823, to re-enforce these. Ludovic Micara, a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> of <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Bishop on 13 April, 1820, and appointed Apostolic of the Tibet-Hindustan Mission. But circumstances prevented his leaving <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, where he died, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>. The Right Rev. Zenobius Benucci, O. C., <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Herma, was appointed Vicar-Apostolic of Agra, and died at Agra, 23 June, 1824. From then up to 1886 there was a regular succession of vicars-apostolic of Agra. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Humanae Salutis Auctor", 1 September, 1886, constituted and erected the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and converted the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate apostolic</a> of Agra, into <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>. The Mission of Tibet had been productive of good results, and after two centuries (1703-1906) it has expanded into a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> province. The suffragans of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Agra are the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/01316b.htm">Allahabad</a> and Lahore and the Prefects Apostolic of Rajputana, Bettiah and Nepal Kafristan and Kashmer. The Metropolitan, with his suffragans rules over a country comprised in the following political divisions of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>: The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">United Provinces</a> of Agra and Oudh, the Central <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> Agency, the Punjab, the North-West Frontier Province, Kashmir, and portions of Bengal and the Central Provinces.

<p>The Begum Sumroo, who ruled over Sardhana as a vassal of Delhi, was a convert from <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>. With this princess the fathers of the Tibetan Mission found a home. She obtained from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the promotion of Father Giulio Cesare, one of the members of the Mission, to the episcopal dignity. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">His Holiness Pope Gregory XVI</a> wrote to her, and sent her tokens of his paternal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. This gifted and great <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> caused <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> to be respected even amidst the decay of the great Mogul empire. She bequeathed to her posterity not only an example of regal munificence in her many charitable endowments, but also a holy heritage in the colony of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that survive to this day in her beloved Sardhana. The following list of Bishops of Tibet-Hindustan, with their dates of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, is culled from the compilation made by Father Felix of the <a href="../cathen/08742c.htm">Diocese of Lahore</a> (Cath. Calendar and Directory of the Archdiocese): Rt. Rev. Ludovic Micara, O.C., <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 13 April, 1820; Rt. Rev. Zenobius Benucci, O.C., 1823; Anthony Pezzoni, O.C., 1826; Dr. Joseph Angelus Planella, O.C., <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toposo with right of succession of the Vicar-Apostolic of Agra; Joseph Anthony Borghi, O.C., <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1839; Cajetan Carli O.C., 1844; Ignatius Persico, O.C., 1854; Angelicus Bedenik, O.C., 1861; Michael Angelus Jacobi, 1868.

<p>Bishop Jacobi was created first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Agra 1 September, 1886, and died at Mussoorie 14 October, 1891. The Most Rev. Dr. Emmanuel Van Den Bosch was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08742c.htm">Lahore</a> in 1891 and transferred to the Archbishopric of Agra in 1892. He resigned in 1898. The Most Rev. Dr. Charles Gentili, O.C., was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01316b.htm">Allahabad</a> 29 June, 1897, and appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Agra 27 August, 1898.

<p>The Archdiocese of Agra has a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 9,442; <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 38; <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 16; sisters, 228; brothers, 11; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, 11; for girls, 5; colleges for boys, 2; for girls, 1; <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, 6; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for boys, 3; inmates 403; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 5; inmates 459; preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 1.
