<h1>Alain Chartier</h1>  

<p>A French poet, born about 1390, at <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>, died between 1430 and 1440. It is believed he studied at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, as did his brother Guillaume, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, who died in 1472. Alain was considered an eminent writer during his life, and a century later he was still regarded by the best men of letters as a "noble poet and orator" (Jean Lemaire de Belges), and as "the father of French eloquence" (Jean Bouchet). He is better known to us by the famous story of <a href="../cathen/09655c.htm">Margaret of Scotland</a>, who is said to have <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> his lips while he was sleeping in her palace, to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, she said "the mouth which elicited so many virtuous words". However pretty this story may be, it is only a legend, because <a href="../cathen/09655c.htm">Margaret of Scotland</a> came to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> only in 1436, and, according to the best authorities, Chartier was already dead. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of Chartier's youth. His first work was "Le livre des quatre dames", written not long after the defeat of Agincourt (1415) During the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and amidst the horrors of the English invasion versial <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> poems, in which he attained a considerable skill. Among them are: "Le d&eacute;bat de reveille-matin"; "Le d&eacute;bat des deus fortun&eacute;s d'amour"; "Belle dame sans merci". These compositions were highly praised by contemporaries, but to a modern reader they appear lifeless and pedantic, a most complete example of the scholarly method which, at that time, tended to take the place of inspiration in French poetry. His "Br&eacute;viaire des Nobles", a code of the perfect <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>, is better than his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> songs. In 1417 Chartier was driven from Bayeaux by the English invasion, and in 1418 from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> faction. He entered the service of Dauphin Charles, "King of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>" afterwards King Charles VII. whom he served as private secretary most faithfully. He was entrusted with important missions for the king. In 1424 he went to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and in 1428 to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>.

<p>Chartier is noteworthy as a prose writer, his prose being far superior to his poetry; his style is full of harmony, constantly enlightened by fine sentences, which are compared by Pasquier to those of Seneca. The "Quadrilogue invectif", composed in 1422, is a dialogue in which <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> entreats nobility, people and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, to unite their efforts to save her from invasion and civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The "Livre de l'esp&eacute;rance" or "Livre des trois vertus" is a moral dissertation. The "Curial" deals with the dangers and corruption of the courtier's life. Because of the loftiness, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and dignity of his life, Chartier was entitled to teach moral lessons and to preach disinterestedness and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">Christian virtues</a>. Chartier's works were edited by Duchesne (Paris, 1617); Buchberger mentions an edition of his works by Montaigion (Paris 1861).
