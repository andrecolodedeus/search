<h1>Alain de l'Isle</h1>  

<p>(Also called ALAIN OF LILLE, ALANUS AB INSULIS, or DE INSULIS, ALAIN VON RYSSEL etc.).

<p>Monk, poet, preacher, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and eclectic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, b. probably at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, whence his name, about 1128; d. at <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, 1203. Alain, there is reason to believe, studied and taught for some time in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1179 he took part in the Third Council of the Lateran. Later he entered the Monastery of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, where he died in 1202 or 1203. Alain attained extraordinary celebrity in his day as a teacher and a learned man; he was called Alain the Great, The Universal Doctor, etc. To this the legend alludes, according to which a scholar, discomfited in a <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> contest, cried out that his opponent was "either Alain or the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>". Alain's principal work is "Ars Fidei Catholic&aelig;", dedicated to <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a>, and composed for the purpose of refuting, on rational grounds, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. With the same view he wrote "Tractatus Contra H&aelig;reticos" and "Theologic&aelig; Regul&aelig;". He wrote two poems, "De Planctu Natur&aelig;" and "Anticlaudianus". The only collection of Alain's works is <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> somewhat uncritical edition, P.L., CCX. The two poems are published by Wright in "Satirical Poets of the Twelfth Century", II (Rerum Britannicarum Scriptores). There are several of Alain's treatises still unpublished for instance, "De Virtutibus et Vitiis" (Codex, Paris, Bibl. Nat., n. 3238). Alain's <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is characterized by that peculiar variety of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> tinged with <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> which is found in the writings of John <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Erigena, and which afterwards reappeared in the works of <a href="../cathen/12670c.htm">Raymond Lully</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> is, perhaps, more in the style than in the matter; the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> consists in the effort to prove that all religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, even the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, flow out of principles that are self-evident to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> unaided by revelation. His philosophy is a <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretism</a>, or eclecticism, in which the principal elements are <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>, <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a>, and Pythagoreanism. He esteemed <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> as <em>the</em> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>; <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> he regarded merely as a subtle <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logician</a>. His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> he derived from Martianus Capella Apuleius, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, and the members of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>; his first-hand acquaintance with the "Dialogues" being limited to Chalcidius's rendering of a fragment of the "Tim&aelig;us". He was acquainted with some of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> writings and with the commentaries of <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> and Porphyry. He derived his Pythagoreanism from the so-called Hermetical writers, Asclepius and Mercurius. Finally his mystic manner was influenced by <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a> and John <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Erigena.

<p>The effect of all these influences was an attempt on Alain's part to fuse into one system the various elements derived from different sources, without taking much pains to find a common basis or a principle of organic synthesis. Thus, in <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> he gives at different times three different divisions of the faculties of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: a twofold (<em>ratio, sensualitas</em>), a threefold (<em>sapientia, voluntas, voluptas</em>), and a fivefold (<em>sensus, imaginatio, ratio, intellectus, intelligentia</em>). The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he teaches, is spirit; the body, matter (in later <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> sense); and the bond between them is a physical spirit (<em>spiritus physicus</em>). In <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmology</a> he teaches that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first created "Nature", whose role it was to act as his intermediary (<em>Dei auctoris vicaria</em>) in the details of creating and organizing matter into the visible <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. At every step in this portion of his philosophy the influence of the neo-Pythagoreans appears. As a writer, Alain exhibited an unusual combination of poetic imaginativeness and <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> precision. He modeled his style on that of Martianus Capella, though in his later years the influence of <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> was, perhaps, predominant. He is to be enumerated among the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers who influenced <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>.
