<h1>Alban Isidor Stolz</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and popular author, b. at B&uuml;hl, <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, 3 Feb., 1808; d. at Freiberg, 16 Oct., 1883. He first studied at the gymnasium at Rastatt (1818-27), and then proceeded to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, where, after attending lectures in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> for a brief period, he devoted himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> (1827-30). Owing to the unfortunate condition of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, he fell into scepticism, and could not bring himself to enter the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; but after studying philology at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a> from 1830 to 1832 he regained his former <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Having determined to embrace the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state, he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> in the autumn of 1832, and in August, 1833, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. During the following eight years he was engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work, being <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> first at Rothenfels in the Murgthal, and from June, 1835, at Neusatz, in the District of B&uuml;hl. In the autumn of 1841 he was appointed instructor in religion at the gymnasium of Bruchsal, and on 1 March, 1843, teacher of moral and pastoral theology at the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> college of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>. From May, 1845 he was temporary director of this institution, but his appointment as permanent director was prevented by opponents holding Liberalistic views. In 1845 he became doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and in the autumn of 1847, despite the opposition to his appointment, was made professor of pastoral theology and pedagogics at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. On 13 October, 1848, he was named ordinary professor, and during 1859-60 he was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. He was made honorary doctor of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a> in 1865, and in 1868 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> spiritual counsellor. In both the charitable and social fields Stolz displayed a great and successful activity; in 1851 he founded at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Journeymen's Association after the model of Kolping's, and conducted it as director and later as <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> president. He likewise introduced into <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, of which he remained director until his death. He devoted all the receipts from his writings to the assistance of the poor and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, to the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to home and foreign missions.

<p>As a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> Stolz was too self-opinionated, his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> teachers having failed to give him any fundamental training, and he lacked the exact <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the achievements of earlier <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Hirscher's writings, for which he had an unbounded veneration, were his chief authority. For the teaching of practical subjects, however, he was admirably qualified, and numerous <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students from foreign parts, especially <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, came to Freiburg to attend his scholarly and suggestive lectures. Of his writings in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> domain we may mention: "Katechetische Auslegung des Freiburger Diocesan-Katechismus (Hirscher's Katechismus) f&uuml;r Geistliche, Lehrer und Eltern" (3 vols., Freiburg, 1844-47); "Ueber die Vererbung sittlicher Anlagen" (University Report, Freiburg, 1859); "Erziehungskunst" (Freiburg, 1873; 7th ed. by Julius Mayer, 1910); "Homiletik als Anweisung den Armen das Evangelium zu predigen", published by Jakob Schmitt after the author's death (Freiburg, 1885; 2nd ed., 1899).

<p>In the domain of popular religious literature, Stolz acquired imperishable fame. Gifted and original, a keen observer of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, a master of language with every shade of expression at command, he united a broad sense of humour and an effective satire with a deep sincerity of religious feeling, a delicacy in the portrayal of conditions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and a poetical force and beauty in his descriptions of nature. Among his works, which, besides being published in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, have been translated into French, English, Italian, and other languages, his "Kalendar f&uuml;r Zeit und Ewigkeit", written for the years 1843-47, 1858-59, 1864, 1873-81, and 1884, has been most widely read, these discourses were collected and issued in four volumes under the titles "Kompass f&uuml;r Leben und Sterben" (1861 and frequently); "Das Vaterunser und der unendliche Gruss" (1861); "Wachholder-Geist gegen die Grund&uuml;bel der Welt: Dummheit, S&uuml;nde und Elend" (1879); "Die Nachtigall Gottes" (1888). Very popular also is his "Legende oder der christliche Sternhimmel" (in parts, 1851-60; 12th ed. in 1 quarto vol., 1904; 10th ed. in 4 octavo vols., 1894). With this must be associated another ascetico-religious work, "Die heilige Elisabeth" (1865; 16th ed., 1909), which many consider the ripest work of Stolz. As the fruits of his travels in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1850 he published (1853) the brilliant and highly humorous work "Spanisches f&uuml;r die begildete Welt" (12th ed., 1908); his <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land in 1855 resulted in "Besuch bei Sim, Cham und Japhet, oder Reise in das Heilige Land" (1857; 10th ed., 1909). The works "Witterungen der Seele" (1867; 7th ed., 1910, "Wilder Honig" (1870; 4th ed., 1908), and "D&uuml;rre Kr&#228;ter" (1877; 4th ed., 1908), consist of excerpts from his diaries.

<p>Stolz also wrote a number of pamphlets and brochures, some of polemical and some of moral and ascetical contents, collected under the title of "Kleinigkeiten" (2 collections, 1868 and 1887; 4th ed., 1909). His works were issued in nineteen volumes in Freiburg (1871-95), exclusive of the "Legende" and the explanation of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>; a popular edition of his works has appeared in twelve volumes (1898-1909). From his papers were edited an autobiography, "Nachtgebet meines Lebens. Nach dem Tode des Verfassers herausgegeben und durch Erinnerungen an Alban Stolz erg&#228;nzt von Jakob Schmitt" (Freiburg, 1885; 2nd ed., 1908), and "Predigten" (ed. Julius Mayer, Freiburg, 1908). Another valuable contribution is the correspondence of Stolz with the convert, Julie Meineke, edited by Mayer under the title "F&uuml;gung und F&uuml;hrung" (Freiburg, 1909). Extracts from the writings of Stolz are given in the works "Edelsch&ouml;ner Stellen aus den Schriften von Alban Stolz. Ausgew&#228;hlt von Heinrich Wagner" (Freiburg, 1905; 3rd ed., 1910), and "Bilder zur christkatholischen Glaubens- und Sittenlehre, aus den Schriften von Alban Stolz, Geistlichen und Lehrern sowie dem christlichen Volke gewidmet von Karl Telch" (Freiburg, 1909).
