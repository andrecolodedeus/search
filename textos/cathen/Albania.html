<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Albania</h1>  

<p>The ancient Epirus and <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>, is the most western land occupied by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Its extreme length is about 290 miles, and its breadth from forty to ninety miles. On the west and southwest it is bounded by the Adriatic and the Ionian seas. It is generally divided into three regions: Upper Albania, from the Montenegrin frontier to the river Shkumbi; Lower Albania, or Epirus, from the Shkumbi to the Gulf of Arta; and Eastern Albania, to the east of the Schar-Dagh chain. It is a mountainous and rugged territory, some of its peaks reaching a height of 8,500 feet, and has only one plain of note, that of <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a> (the ancient Scodra, <em>'e Sk&oacute;dra</em>), which holds the lake of the same name and is watered by its affluent, the Drin. Many rivers flow from savage, inaccessible heights to the Ionian Sea: the Mati, Shkumbi, Ergent or Devol, Voynassa, Kalamas. Among them are the celebrated Acheron and Cocytus of antiquity. Albania shares with Greece the peculiar phenomenon of subterranean rivers; the waters of the lake of Jamina flow through one of these underground channels into the Gulf of Arta, and this gave rise to the myth that here was the entrance to the infernal world of the ancient Greeks. The surrounding country is covered with Cyclopean ruins. In the region of Lakes Ochrida and Presba there are passages through the mountains, which facilitates communication between Albania and <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> mail post actually follows the old Via Egmatia of the Romans from Durrazzo (the ancient Dyrrachium) to <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Salonica</a>, passing by Bitolia. Further down, between the Grammos and the Pindar chains, a defile allows communication with the road from Jamina to Larissa. The Mavropotamas, or Acheron, formerly received the affluents of the Cocytus and Phlegeton, which have now disappeared. The soil is barren from want of cultivation and the exports are few, consisting principally of hides, bark for dyeing, and tobacco. If the Boyana river were made navigable, Scutari would be connected with the sea, and trade would assuredly lead to progress of all kinds; but <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> rule precludes the attempt.

<p>The Albanians (more of an ethnographic than a geographic term) are called Arnauts (Arnaoots, Arnaouts) by the other peoples of the Balkan peninsula; they give themselves the name of <em>Skipetars</em> or "mountaineers". They claim descent from the Epirots and Illyrians, and, like the latter, have always been distinguished by their warlike spirit. After having been conquered in the Illyrian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the tribes of this region furnished the best soldiers of the empire, several emperors were of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyrian</a> stock (Freeman, The Illyrian Emperors, Historical Essays, London, 1892, III, 22-68). <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> probably penetrated these mountain fastnesses through the Roman soldiers and traders from Epirus and <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>; it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether any traces of the original apostolate survived the ruin of the Roman State in the West. After the dismemberment of the Roman Empire, the Illyrian population, gradually driven southward by the invading <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, became known as Albanians, were long subject to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> Constantinople, then fell under the sway of the Serbs, and finally became (1336-56) a province of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Servian Empire under Tsar Stephen Duschan. (See <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">SERVIA</a>.) On its dismemberment, after the battle of Kosovo which took place (1389), the victorious <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> overran the country, but Prince George Castriota, the famous Scanderbeg who was known also as Iskander Bey, or Prince Alexander, maintained an independent rule in Upper Albania for a quarter of a century (1443-67). This hero, whose feats of valour are almost legendary, was bred as a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> at the court of Murad II to whom he had been given as a hostage by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, an Albanian chief; but after having won fame and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the Sultan's service, his race asserted itself, and he broke away to place himself at the head of his own people and embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. He defeated the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> army in several engagements and secured an honourable peace on his own terms. But, encouraged by the Pope and the promise of help from the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, he again attacked the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and gained numerous victories. On his death at <a href="../cathen/01284b.htm">Alessio</a> (1467), the Sultan exclaimed: "Now that the infidels have lost their sword and buckler, who can save them from my wrath?" The Albanians became disorganized and were finally subjected (1479) to <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> dominion. They have, however, never been subdued, and are, even today, treated more like allies than subjects. They now supply the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> army with its best soldiers as they once did the legions of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and are exempted from taxes and from compulsory military service. As volunteers, they receive high pay and many privileges. While several tribes have embraced <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> and others belong to the <a href="../cathen/13535a.htm">Greek schism</a>, the best of the population is <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and while guarding traditional customs and a primitive manner of life, practise their religion devoutly. The purity of their <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> is proverbial throughout the Balkan peninsula, and the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Austrian and Italian missionaries have met with conditions most favourable for their teaching. Schools have been opened in all the villages of note by <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, but the spread of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is hindered by the lack of a gramatically organized language. Many attempts have been made to decide upon an alphabet, but none has yet succeeded owing to the difficulty of expressing the oral sounds by any known combination of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> letters. A cultured Albanian, therefore, takes Roumanian, Greek, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servian</a>, or Italian, for his medium of intercommunication. An Albanian journal is published in <a href="../cathen/03045a.htm">Bukarest</a> and another in Belgrade. In the country itself there is no attempt at a newspaper, and the periodicals most prevalent in the towns are Italian publications of a religious tone. The tribes which have resisted <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> rule successfully and retained their creed have, notwithstanding this, adopted many <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> customs.
<h2>Religion</h2>

<p>For four centuries the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Albanians have defended their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>, greatly aided by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries, especially since the middle of the seventeenth century, when the cruel persecutions of their <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> lords began to bring about the apostasy of many villages, particularly among the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">schismatic Greeks</a>. The College of Propoganda at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was especially prominent in the religious and moral support of the Albanian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly, it <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> for service on the Albanian missions, contributed then as now to their support and to that of the churches, in which good work it is aided by the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government, which gives yearly to those missions about five thousand dollars, in its quality of Protector of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community under <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> rule. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> legislation of the Albanians was reformed by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, who caused a general <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> visitation to be held (1763) by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01582b.htm">Antivari</a>, at the close of which a <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a> was held. Its decrees were printed by <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (1705), and renewed in 1803 (Coll. Lucensis Conc. Recent., I, 283 sq.). In 1872, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> caused a second <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a> to be held at <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a>, for the renovation of the popular and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. Apropos of the Austrian interest in Albania, it may be stated that it is the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> ambassador who obtains from the Sultan the <em>Berat,</em> or civil document of institution for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Albania (Neber, in K. L., XI, 18, 19).



<p>Albania is divided ecclesiastically into several <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">archiepiscopal provinces</a>: (1) Antivari (since 1878 a part of the principality of <a href="../cathen/10529c.htm">Montenegro</a>; since 1886, without suffragans, and separated from <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a>, with which it had been united in 1867 on terms of equality); (2) Scutari, with the suffragan Sees of <a href="../cathen/01284b.htm">Alessio</a>, <a href="../cathen/12561b.htm">Pulati</a>, <a href="../cathen/13467b.htm">Sappa</a> and (since 1888) the <em>Abbatia millius</em> of St. Alexander of Orosci; (3) Durazzo; (4) Uskup. The latter two are without suffragans, and depend immediately on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. A <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, founded in 1858 by Archbishop Topich of <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a>, was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, but was later re-established on Austrian territory and placed under the imperial protection. In Scutari the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as well as the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a>, go veiled. The Albanian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> works unceasingly in the field and in the home; so that every household care devolves upon her in the frequent absence of the men who are either regular or irregular fighters in the Albanian or Turko- Albanian bands. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are dressed in tight skirts of light colour striped with black, and their heads and shoulders are covered on feast days with masses of gold and silver <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> appear unveiled, and the humbler class generally remove their shoes at the entrance. The service in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a> is most impressive, although primitive to an extreme degree. There is little quiet, for the congregation rasps out the responses with a fervour that precludes either modulation or rhythm, and the incessant rattle of the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> on the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> breasts and heads as they bend forward and again kneel upright accompanies every intonation. The scarlet colour predominates in the altar decorations, as well as in the clothes of the worshippers. It is impossible to witness the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Albanian at worship and remain unmoved at his simple, whole-hearted demonstration of living <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The admirable work of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> in dispelling the old vendetta custom is one of the chief factors in the evolution of this semi-barbaric race. The Albanians of to-day give the same promise of a vigorous <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> development as the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> of the time of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, and it is characteristic of their steadfastness that no bribes or threats have succeeded in drawing them from their first allegiance. While every other race in the Balkans, with the exception of the Western Serbs, called <em>Hroats</em> (Croats), went over to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> remained secure in the fastnesses of northern Albania.

<p>When one recalls that to adopt <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a> meant to become a lord and a recognized warrior, while to remain <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> meant to become a slave, deprived of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to carry weapons, it is easily seen why so many Albanian tribes fell away. The chief tribes of Upper Albania, the Shoshi and the Mirdites, are at once the pioneers of nationality and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>. Long ago the Mirdites were wont to carry off <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> girls of good <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and, after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them, made them their wives, so that there is a strong strain of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> blood in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Mirdites of to-day. This tribe has special privileges, such as the place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the Sultan's army under the command of its own chieftain. In accepting a comradeship of arms with <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> troops it guards the creed and nationality with the same fidelity with which it serves the Sultan when called upon. The Mirdites, about 40,000 in number, and with a chief town of some four hundred houses, Orosci, treat on equal terms with the Porte. The force of circumstances has driven the Albanian into fierce espousal of one or other of the causes which are being periodically fought out between antagonists whose success or defeat leaves his own condition almost unchanged. It was an Albanian who led the Greeks in the War of Independence, and again an Albanian who commanded the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> troops sent to quell the rebellion. The Kings of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> kept an Albanian regiment styled the Royal Macedonian, and the famous resistance of Silistria in 1854 is due to dogged Albanian <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>. Courage and heroism are inborn qualities of this singular and gifted race. The revival of the national aspirations of Albania dates from the Congress of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> (1878), when <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, in order to compensate Servia and Montenegro for her retention of the Servian lands of <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, thought to divide the land of Albania between them. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> secretly fostered the opposition of both <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and the Albanian League was formed "for the maintenance of the country's integrity and the reconstitution of its independence". The territories alloted to Servia were already occupied by her troops when resistance broke forth, and the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of dislodging them had to be abandoned; but Montenegro was unable to obtain possession of her share, the rich districts of Gusinie and Plava. The Albanians, undaunted by the unexpected opposition of their former allies, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, now forced by <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to assist Montenegro, made face against all their enemies with a determination that baffled and dismayed <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Mehemet- Ali was routed, his house at Diakovo burned down, and himself massacred. The Albanians had much to avenge. They had not yet forgotten the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of a century before when their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> precipitated themselves by hundreds over the roads near Yamina to escape Ali-Pasha's soldiers. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> finally relinquished their efforts to quell the movement they had themselves helped to precipitate, and Montenegro had to content herself with the barren tracts of the Boyana and the port of Dulcigno. She could not have aspired even to these, had not <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, anxious to spread the doctrines of "Orthodoxy", advocated the dismemberment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> Albania in favour of the Servian race.

<p>After Scutari, Yanina is the largest and most interesting town of modern Albania. Near it are the ruins of the temple of Dodona, the cradle of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> civilization in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>. This <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> uttered its prophecies by interpreting the rustling of oak branches; the fame of its priestesses drew votaries from all parts of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>. In this neighbourhood also dwelt the Pelagic tribes of Selles, or Helles, and the Graiki, whose names were afterwards taken to denote the Hellenes, or Greeks. The plateau of Tanina is fertile and favourably situated for defence, and the inhabitants of the city have been able to develop many industries, such as the inlaying of metal, weaving gold-threaded stuffs, and the fabrication of fire-arms. It is difficult to get the exact statistics of any province of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire; the population of Albania is variously estimated, from 1,200,000 to 1,600,000, of which 1,500,000 are strictly Albanian. In the Kirchenlex. (Freiburg, 1899), XI, 18, <a href="../cathen/10739a.htm">Father Neher</a> estimates the population at about 1,400,000, one million of which is made up of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. There are 318,000 members of the Greek <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> church, and about 120,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It must be added that there are in Greece proper about 250,000 Albanians, and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> about 100,000, the latter being all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In summing up the characteristics of the race, there are two points on which travellers invariably agree: the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalry</a> toward the weaker sex of even the unreclaimed Albanian, and the spotless chastity of their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. For the rest, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> is as cheap as in all lands where <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> must reckon on themselves for its preservation. (See A<font size=-2>NTIVARI,</font> S<font size=-2>CUTARY,</font> D<font size=-2>URAZZO,</font> and the other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Albania.)
