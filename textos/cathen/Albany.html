<h1>Albany</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising the entire counties of Albany, Columbia, <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">Delaware</a>, Fulton, Greene, Montgomery, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Warren, Washington, and that part of Herkimer and Hamilton counties south of the northern line of the townships of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, Benson and Hope, in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>. It covers a territory of 10,419 square miles. Of the total population (852,471), 180,030 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The majority are of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, German or <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French-Canadian</a> origin, but other nationalities and races are also represented&mdash; Italian, Polish, Russian, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a>, Greek, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a>, <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, and some American <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">Negroes</a>.
<h2>Colonial period</h2>

<p>Any general account of the early missions within the borders of the present diocese of Albany must include, with more or less detail, the labours of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who came into it from Quebec with credentials first from the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>), and afterwards from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Quebec itself, that ancient centre of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life. From this point of view, the territory embraced in its limits has a unique history of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>, undaunted <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, grievous hardships, and privations endured, blood shed for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and for many years an apparently hopeless struggle with the most astute and resourceful of all the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> who lived on the flats of the Mohawk Valley, and whose cruel nature was finally subdued by the gentleness and perseverance of these French missionaries. Its history starts with the treaty of Saint-Germaini des Pr&eacute;s (1632), when <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at last restored <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a> first offered the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> missions to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, who refused, and then to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who accepted them. Quebec and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, founded in the first half of the seventeenth century, were the two foci of all missionary ardour and enterprise until the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Bishop Carroll in 1790, not only for <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and the Northwest, but also for all the country adjacent to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, including northern and central New York as far as the stockades of Fort Orange or Albany, which from the time of the English occupation in 1664 became subject to the vicar-apostolic of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. The pioneer missionary in the district now known as a part and parcel of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Albany was Father <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Isaac Jogues</a>, who reached Ossernenon, or <a href="../cathen/02111b.htm">Auriesville</a>, in Montgomery County, 14 August, 1642, as a captive of the cruel and treacherous Mohawks. Mutilated and dismembered, he escaped by the aid of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> at Fort Orange, and, taking passage on a vessel bound for <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, reached his own country on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas day</a>. His successor in captivity and torture by the same tribe was <a href="../cathen/02766a.htm">Father Joseph Bressani</a>, a Roman <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> (1644). The same year <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Father Jogues</a> returned to Quebec, and was sent in May, 1646, into the Mohawk country, as an agent to ratify a peace with this tribe. On this journey he reached Lake George on the Feast of Corpus Christi and named it Lac St. Sacrament. Having received their promises of good will he returned to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, but, deceived and lured by their wily attitude of friendship, he retraced his steps at once to establish a mission among them. In October, 1646, he was tomahawked, beheaded, and his body thrown into the Mohawk river. In his footsteps and, some of them, in his sufferings followed Fathers <a href="../cathen/12228b.htm">Joseph Poncet</a>, <a href="../cathen/09149a.htm">Le Moyne</a>, and Jacques de Lamberville, who had the glory of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, 1675, Tegakouita, who is called Catharine in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> record, and "The Lily of the Mohawk" by <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a>.

<p>Within the stockaded settlement of Fort Orange another current of history was running more tranquilly than through these blood-stained Mohawk chronicles. Without straining the verities of history, that foundation named Fort Orange, and surnamed Albany, merits the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being the oldest surviving <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> settlement in the original Thirteen States. <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> in the beginning, it was wrested from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> in 1664 by Charles II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, who regardless of their claims, granted to his brother, the Duke of York and Albany, afterwards James II, all the land lying between the Connecticut and Delaware rivers. Before the transfer <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were few. Two Portuguese sailors at Fort Orange in 1626, a Portuguese <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and a transient Irishman, met by <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Father Jogues</a> in 1643, made up the quota. After the English possession there is credible evidence that several <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> settled in Albany in 1677, for whom the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Father Hennepin</a> provided. In 1682 came <a href="../cathen/05130a.htm">Colonel Thomas Dongan</a> as governor, the son of an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> baronet, afterwards the Earl of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>. The project of detaching the Five Nations from the French, who had won them by the disinterested labours of their missionaries, suggested the scheme of colonizing them at Saratoga under <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> influence, to counteract a similar colonization enterprise at La Prairie under French auspices. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Thomas Harvey, Henry Harrison, Charles Gage, and two lay-brothers were the pathfinders under the new regime.


<h2>American period</h2>

<p>In 1790 John Carroll was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and Albany passed over to his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> from that of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Quebec. Saint Mary's, the first church in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and for many years the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church between St. Peter's, Barclay Street, <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York City</a>, and Detroit, was built in 1797 during the episcopate of John Carroll. Because of its isolation, its corner stone was laid by one of its trustees, Thomas Barry. The earlier <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> during this Baltimore era were Fathers Thayer, Whelan, O'Brien, D. Mahoney, James Buyshe, and Hurley. The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> of mark were James Roubichaux, Louis Le Coulteaux, David McEvers, Thomas Barry, William Duffy, and Daniel Cassidy. On the same day of the year 1808, Baltimore was elevated to the rank of an archdiocese, and three new sees were created: New York, Philadelphia, and <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New York assumed <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the entire State, and Albany heard the voice of a new shepherd. From this year to the year of its erection as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (23 April, 1847) there was a steady growth of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, sluggish at first, and afterwards flowing with fuller volume as we approach the years of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> famine and the climatic of immigration. Within this New York era we note the foundation of the following <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and churches:-

<p>St. Peter's, Troy, 1826; its pioneer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the Revs. McGilligan, John Shanahan, and James Quinn. St. John's, Schenectady, 1830, organized by the Rev. Charles Smith, of St. Mary's, Albany; its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> the Rev. John Kelly, succeeded by the Rev. Patrick McCloskey. St. John's, Albany, 1837; its first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the Rev. John Kelly, and his successors, the Revs. McDonough and Patrick McCloskey. St. Patrick's, Watervliet, 1840; the earliest attending <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the Rev. John Shanahan, then <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Peter's, Troy. The Rev. James Quinn, assistant at St. Peter's, became first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of this <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, succeeded by the Rev. Thomas Martin. <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">Church</a> of the Assumption, Little Falls, 1841; its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> the Rev. Joseph M. Bourke. St. Joseph's, Albany, 1842: founded by the Rev. Joseph Schneller, then at St. Mary's, Albany, who was succeeded by the Revs. Newell and P. Hogan. The Rev. John J. Conroy, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Albany, was its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. St. Mary's, Sandy Hill, 1833 (though first mentioned in the Directory in 1842); its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> the Rev. Father Guerdet. St. Mary's, Troy, was built in 1843 by the Rev. Peter Havermans. St. Augustine's, Lansingburg, 1844, had for its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> the Rev. F. Coyle.

<p>The prominent <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> of this epoch were Peter Morange, Thomas Austen, James Mahar, William Hawe, Patrick McQuade, Peter Cagger, John Stuart, Thomas Geough, Thomas Mattimore, John Tracey, Dr. O'Callaghan, of Albany, John Keenan, of Glens Falls, Keating Rawson, Thomas Sausse, and Philip Quinn, of Troy.
<h2>Bishops of Albany</h2>

<p>(1) The Right Rev. John McCloskey, D.D. (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>), <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Coadjutor-Bishop of New York, 10 March, 1844, transferred to Albany as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 21 May, 1847. He first selected the venerable St. Mary's church as his episcopal city for his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and, that proving unsuitable, he began the erection of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the Immaculate Conception, the corner stone of which was laid 2 July, 1848, by Archbishop Hughes. The edifice, completed with the exception of one of its twin towers, was dedicated 21 November, 1852. It is suggestive that the church was christened before the Immaculate Conception was declared an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a>. He convened the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod 7 October, 1855. To provide for the inrush of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants he founded many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, encouraged the building of many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and augmented the number of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> proving insufficient, he invited the assistance of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, to whom he entrusted the large <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Joseph's, in Troy. He was tireless in visiting every portion of his extensive diocese, which comprised all that territory now included in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Albany, <a href="../cathen/14397a.htm">Syracuse</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a>. He made provision for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> by installing Religious of the Sacred Heart in Albany, and the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> in Troy. He disarmed anti-Catholic and anti-Irish bias by the charm of his <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and the winsome <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of his consummate oratory.

<p>(2) The Right Rev. John Joseph Conroy, D.D., <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 15 October, 1865. He built the beautiful St. Joseph's Church in the city of Albany, and established a home for the aged in charge of the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> under the care of the Sisters of Charity and <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> in the same city. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> still proving inadequate for the growing and insistent needs of the ministry, he encouraged the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian Fathers</a> and the Minor <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> to cast their lot with the diocese. He secured the future of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> by establishing the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Sacred Heart at Kenwood, and soliciting and welcoming foundations of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Carondelet, Mo., <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, and Sisters of the Holy Names. The second <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was held in his episcopate.

<p>(3) The Right Rev. Francis McNeirny, D.D., <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 21 April, 1872. He purchased the rectory for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at 12 Madison Place, the chancery at 125 Eagle street, and the historic Schuyler mansion as an additional asylum. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Tertiaries, Sisters of the Good Shepherd, and <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a> established foundations at his invitation. He systematized the work of the chancery, formulated schedules for complete annual reports from each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and initiated the practice of convening <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, administering confirmation, and canonically visiting every church in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> triennially. Clerical conferences, conducted with method and regularity, were his creation, and he closed his episcopate and his life with their crowning achievement&mdash;the enlargement and completion of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by the addition of an <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> and the erection of new sacristies and a tower.

<p>(4) The Right Rev. Thomas M.A. Burke, D.D., <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1 July, 1894. He erected the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and rectory of St. Joseph's parish, Albany, whilst its <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, and evidenced administrative capacity of a high order in the management of its affairs. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he has enlarged the Boys' Asylum in Albany, cancelled the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, refurnished and renewed it, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it with solemn ceremonial, 16 November, 1902. With characteristic exactitude for all canonical processes and requirements in the matter of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, visitations, erection of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, homes of industry and charity, and the holding of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church properties</a>, he is indefatigable and continues the best traditions and labours of his predecessors.
<h2>Causes of growth</h2>

<p>The growth of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is explained entirely by immigration. The incentives to it were predominantly industrial. Agriculture played only a moderate part, and, as a rule, the land was second choice. In the early years of the last century New York State entered upon a vast scheme of internal improvements - the linking of the great lakes with the ocean by a system of canals. As Albany was the chief beneficiary of the enterprise, it became the principal distributing centre of the army of labourers who flocked into it in quest of employment. Work on the Erie Canal was begun in 1817 and completed in 1825. Development of the entire system of artificial waterways went on simultaneously. These opened up a vast uninhabited territory to tillage, colonization, and manufacture. From 1831 to 1852 railroad construction was under way, and as <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was then pouring into this country a flood-tide of fugitives from the famine, they found remunerative work at once. The earnings of these labourers were the chief contribution to the erection of contemporaneous churches. On the completion of the canals and railways, some of these strangers purchased land and began a farming life; most of them either threw in their lot with the new settlements sprouting promiscuously along the new lines of travel, or sought residence and employment in special localities because of their prosperous industries. Albany drew numbers because of its lumber, iron, stoves, shoes, cattle, and breweries; Glens Falls attracted by its flourishing lumber activities; Ballston by its tanneries; Cohoes by its axe industry, and cotton and woolen mills; Troy by the manufacture of stoves, nails, railway iron, and collars; Schagticoke and Amsterdam by their textile manufactures. During these years facilities of communication made access to most of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> comparatively easy, and the people were attended by a growing ministry. Its northern and lower western sections remained isolated and accessible only with great difficulty for many years, and here were some leakages from the Faith. Bigotry was rife in out-of-the-way corners, and met <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> profession and practice with <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> and slight&mdash;without <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, however. All this is superseded in our day by juster standards of measurement.
<h2>Notable benefactors</h2>

<p>The Right Rev. John J. Conroy, the Right Rev. Monsignor McDermott, and the Rev. P. McCloskey left bequests for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The Rev. Maurice Sheehan, the Rev. William Cullinan, and Mrs. Peter Cagger were generous patrons of St. Peter's Hospital, Albany. For various and large benefactions the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is indebted to John A. McCall, of New York; Anthony N. Brady, and Eugene D. Wood, of Albany; Thomas Breslin, of Waterford; Edward Murphy, Jr.; James O'Neil, Francis J. Molloy, Edmund Fitzgerald, Peter McCarthy, and Daniel E. Conway, of Troy. In the field of charity and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> usefulness, where fidelity to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests was and is a dominating principle of conduct, the names of Nicholas Hussey, John H. Farrell, Charles Tracey, Peter Cassidy, John W. McNamara, James F. Tracey, John P. McDonough, Edward F. Hussey, of Albany, and Edward Kelly, P.P. Connolly, Cornelius F.
