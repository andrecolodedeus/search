<h1>Alberic of Ostia</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> from 1138-47. Born in 1080, at <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, 1147. He entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cluny and became its sub-prior and, later, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of St. Martin-des-Champs, but was recalled (1126) to Cluny by Peter the Venerable, to aid in the restoration of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> in that famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In 1131 he was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of V&eacute;zelay in the <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Diocese of Autun</a>, and held that office until he was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Pope Innocent II</a> (1138). Immediately after his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> Alberic went as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He was successful in his endeavours to end the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> then raging for possession of the throne between the usurper Stephen of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> and David I of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, who had espoused the cause of Empress Matilda. He then called a council of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, which assembled at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, December 1138, and at which eighteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and about thirty <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were present. The chief business of the council, besides some disciplinary measures, was the election of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> for the See of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. Thibaut, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bec, was chosen, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Alberic. Accompanied by Thibaut and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in January, 1139. The same year, Alberic was sent to exhort the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, a town on the Adriatic, to acknowledge as their lawful sovereign Roger II of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, against whom they were in revolt. They refused, however, to listen to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and shut their gates against him. In 1140 Alberic was appointed to examine into the conduct of Rodolph, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. In a council of eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, at which Alberic presided, Rodolph was <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, and was cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> (30 November, 1140). <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugenius III</a> sent Alberic (1147) to combat the Henrician <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">ALBIGENSES</a>), who were causing much trouble in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. In a letter written at this time to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of that district, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a> calls Alberic "the venerable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, a man who has done great things in Israel, through whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has often given victory to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". St. Bernard was induced to join the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, and it was owing chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and eloquence of the Saint that the embassy was in some degree successful. Three days before the arrival of St. Bernard, Alberic had been given a very cold welcome. The populace, in derision of his office, had gone to meet him, riding on asses, and escorted him to his residence with the music of rude instruments. It is said of him that he could not win the people, but that the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> feared him more than any other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of his time. The last work of Alberic was that of co-operating with St. Bernard in promoting the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a>. He it was who arranged with Louis VII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the details of the undertaking.
