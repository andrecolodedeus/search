<h1>Albero de Montreuil</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, b. near Toul, in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, about 1080; d. at Coblenz, 18 January, 1152. After acquiring some dignities in the churches of Toul and Verdun, he was made Archdeacon and Provost of St. Arnulf at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>. Here he became identified with the church reform party which was opposed to Bishop Adalbero IV, and went in person to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to secure his <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposition</a> from Pope Paschalis II. On his return he brought about the election of Theotger, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. George in the Black Forest, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> against his will in July, 1118, and, being prevented from entering his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by the imperial party, died in 1120. Albero then aided in the election of Stephen of Bar, who rewarded his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> by making him primicerius of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>. After having been mentioned for the vacant Sees of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> and Halberstadt, both of which he refused, Albero was in 1130, chosen <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> to succeed Meginher. The position was not an easy one, for the church was in need of reform, and the previous occupants of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> had been dominated by the Burgrave Ludwig. He could not be induced to accept the burden until <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> summoned him to the Synod at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and even threatened him with <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspension</a> from his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the Pope himself at Vienne.

<p>Albero vigorously prosecuted the work of reform. He restored peace and order in his archdiocese, and before his death made it one of the most important in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1136 he accompanied the Emperor, Lothair II, on his expedition into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, whither he had been summoned by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> to resist the aggressions of Roger of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, one of the adherents of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a>. In the dispute which arose between the Pope and the Emperor, Albero showed himself a staunch defender of the Papal cause, and on his return <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent</a> made him <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Gaul and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Papal Legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. After the death of Lothair he took an active part in the election of Conrad III, founder of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. In 1148, <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugene III</a> visited <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, after presiding at the Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and was entertained by him with great splendour. Albero was a churchman of great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy. His generosity was unbounded, and though often compelled to take up arms in defence of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he was none the less a devout <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a patron of letters. Among his friends he counted St. Norbert and <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, who seconded his efforts for the restoration of religious <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> in his archdiocese.
