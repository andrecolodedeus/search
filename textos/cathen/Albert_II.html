<h1>Albert II</h1>  

<p>(Albrecht II.)

<p>Eighteenth <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. 1232. He was the son of Gunther III, Count of Kevernburg, and began his studies at <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, completing them later at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bologna. At an early age he was made a <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendary</a> of the Magdeburg <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and in 1200 was appointed Provost of the Cathedral Chapter by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. Through the influence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Halberstadt, he was nominated as the successor of Ludolph, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> (d.1205). After receiving the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, which was at first withheld, partly on account of those who had taken part in his election and partly on his account of his attitude towards Philip of Suabia, Albert proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the Pope (Dec., 1206) and received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. He entered Magdeburg on <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, 15 April, 1207, and five days later a conflagration destroyed many of the buildings in the city, including his own <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. One of his first cares was to repair the damage wrought by fire, and in 1208 he laid the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which, though completed 156 years later, serves as his most fitting memorial. He likewise rebuilt a large part of the city, and is regarded as the founder of the Neustadt. Magdeburg was also indebted to him for several valuable privileges which he obtained from <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> after the death of Philip of Suabia. Albert did much to further the interest of religion. He established the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> (1224), and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (1225) in the city, and also founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a>.

<p>But Albert's activity was not confined to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He also played a prominent part in the great struggle for the imperial crown, which marked the close of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth centuries. Even before his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, he had inclined to the side of Philip of Suabia, who sought the crown in spite of his nephew Frederick, the son and heir of Henry VI (d.28 Sept., 1197). But later, accepting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> "Deliberation", he gave his support to <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Otto IV</a>, second son of Henry the Lion, who had been set up as anti-king by a party headed by Adolphus of Cologne and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aix-la-Chapelle</a>. After the assassination of Philip (July, 1208) Albert did much his rival acknowledge as king. Otto proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, accompanied by Albert, where hi was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by the Pope on 4 Oct., 1209, and soon after seized <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> and <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>--part of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> territories. Upon attempting to enter <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (<a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, 1211), and his subjects released from their allegiance. Albert, after some hesitation, published the bull of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and thenceforth transferred his allegiance to <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, the Hohenstaufen, son of Henry VI. In 1212 Otto returned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and defied the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. The struggles that followed, in which Magdeburg and its neighbourhood suffered severely, did not come to an end until Otto's power was broken at the battle of Bouvines (1214). Albert is said to have died in 1232 during an interval of peace between the Empire and the Papacy.
