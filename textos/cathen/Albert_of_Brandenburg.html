<h1>Albert of Brandenburg</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, born 28 June, 1490; died 24 September, 1545. As early as 1509 he was <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">Prebendary</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> and Administrator of Halberstadt from 1513; <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> from 1514; <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> from 1518. The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> issued by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in 1514 for the building of the new St. Peter's in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was entrusted to Albert (1517) for publication in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and Brandenburg, This commission has been made by d'Aubign&eacute; and others the ground of many accusations against Albert and <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, as though they had used the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> as a means of enriching themselves personally, "dividing beforehand the spoils of the credulous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>" (d'Aubign&eacute;, History of the Reformation). Albert employed <a href="../cathen/14539a.htm">Tetzel</a> for the actual preaching of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> and furnished him a book of instructions: "Instructio summaria ad Subcommissarios Poenitentiarum et Confessores." Later, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a> addressed a letter of protest to Albert concerning the conduct of <a href="../cathen/14539a.htm">Tetzel</a>, found fault with the Bishop's book of instructions, and asked him to suppress it. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> charges are altogether groundless; the instructions of Albert to the preachers are both wise and edifying. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> letter was disregarded. Though many of the accusations against Albert's <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> were, doubtless, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> was probably justified in thinking that he would find in Albert a strong partisan. The young <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was somewhat worldly-minded, extravagant, better trained in <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> studies than in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, too much given to the patronage of learned men and artists. His long intimacy with Ulrich von Hutten is especially reprehensible. <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to send an admonition to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> because so many books hostile to the Faith were being published under the Bishop's eye. In later life Albert changed his conduct. In his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> celebrated defenders of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> were engaged; at <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> and <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> he met Blessed Peter Faber, S.J., and kept him in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (1542-43); after this he was always a friend to the new order. Albert strove earnestly to introduce a ore perfect system of religious instruction and brought forward measures for that purpose in the Diet of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>. He became by the sincerity of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> the great defender of the Faith in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. As a temporal prince, he ruled his electorate well; he introduced reforms in the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, into the police system, and into commerce. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. An artistic memorial marks the resting-place of his remains.
