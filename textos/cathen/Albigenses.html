<h1>Albigenses</h1>  

<p>(From Albi, Latin <em>Albiga</em>, the present capital of the Department of Tarn).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">neo-Manich&aelig;an</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> that flourished in southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The name Albigenses, given them by the Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (1163) prevailed towards the end of the twelfth century and was for a long time applied to all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. They were also called Catharists (<em>katharos</em>, pure), though in reality they were only a branch of the Catharistic movement. The rise and spread of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was favoured by various circumstances, among which may be mentioned: the fascination exercised by the readily-grasped <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> principle; the remnant of Jewish and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> elements; the wealth, leisure, and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginative</a> mind of the inhabitants of Languedoc; their contempt for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, caused by the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and the worldly, too frequently <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a>, lives of the latter; the protection of an overwhelming majority of the nobility, and the intimate local blending of national aspirations and religious sentiment.
<h2 id="section1">Principles</h2>
<h3 id="A">Doctrinal</h3>

<p>The Albigenses asserted the co-existence of two mutually opposed principles, one good, the other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The former is the creator of the spiritual, the latter of the material world. The bad principle is the source of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; natural phenomena, either ordinary like the growth of plants, or extraordinary as earthquakes, likewise moral disorders (<a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>), must be attributed to him. He created the human body and is the author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which springs from matter and not from the spirit. The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> must be either partly or entirely ascribed to him; whereas the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is the revelation of the beneficent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The latter is the creator of human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which the bad principle <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in material bodies after he had deceived them into leaving the kingdom of light. This earth is a place of punishment, the only <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> that exists for the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Punishment, however, is not everlasting; for all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, being Divine in nature, must eventually be liberated. To accomplish this deliverance <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent upon earth <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who, although very perfect, like the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is still a mere creature. The Redeemer could not take on a genuine human body, because he would thereby have come under the control of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle. His body was, therefore, of celestial essence, and with it He penetrated the ear of Mary. It was only apparently that He was born from her and only apparently that He suffered. His <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> was not operative, but solely instructive. To enjoy its benefits, one must become a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of Christ</a> (the Albigenses). Here below, it is not the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> but the peculiar <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the Albigenses known as the <em>consolamentum</em>, or "consolation," that purifies the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and ensures its immediate return to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a> will not take place, since by its nature all flesh is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.
<h3 id="B">Moral</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> of the Albigenses was also the basis of their moral teaching. Man, they taught, is a living contradiction. Hence, the liberation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from its captivity in the body is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> end of our being. To attain this, <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> is commendable; it was customary among them in the form of the <em>endura</em> (starvation). The extinction of bodily life on the largest scale consistent with human existence is also a perfect aim. As generation propagates the slavery of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the body, perpetual chastity should be practiced. Matrimonial intercourse is unlawful; <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>, being of a less permanent nature, is preferable to marriage. Abandonment of his wife by the husband, or vice versa, is desirable. Generation was abhorred by the Albigenses even in the animal kingdom. Consequently, abstention from all animal food, except fish, was enjoined. Their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a>, or the transmigration of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the result of their <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> rejection of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, furnishes another explanation for the same abstinence. To this practice they added long and rigorous <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>. The necessity of absolute fidelity to the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was strongly inculcated. War and capital punishment were absolutely condemned.
<h2 id="section2">Origin and history</h2>

<p>The contact of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with the Oriental mind and Oriental <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> had produced several <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> (<a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a>, Bogomilae) whose doctrines were akin to the tenets of the Albigenses. But the historical connection between the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and their predecessors cannot be clearly traced. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where they were probably introduced by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the Neo-Manich&aelig;an doctrines were secretly diffused for several years before they appeared, almost simultaneously, near <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (1022). Those who proposed them were even made to suffer the extreme penalty of death. The Council of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> (1025), Charroux, Dep. of Vienne (c. 1028), and of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1049) had to deal with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. At that of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a> (1114) the case of Neo-Manich&aelig;ans in the <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Diocese of Soissons</a> was brought up, but was referred to the council shortly to be held in the latter city. <a href="../cathen/11781a.htm">Petrobrusianism</a> now familiarized the South with some of the tenets of the Albigenses. Its condemnation by the Council of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1119) did not prevent the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from spreading. <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugene III</a> (1145-53) sent a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, <a href="../cathen/01259b.htm">Cardinal Alberic of Ostia</a>, to Languedoc (1145), and <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> seconded the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate's</a> efforts. But their preaching produced no lasting effect. The Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1148) <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the protectors "of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of Gascony and Provence." That of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (1163) decreed that the Albigenses should be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> confiscated. A religious disputation was held (1165) at Lombez, with the usual unsatisfactory result of such conferences. Two years later, the Albigenses held a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, their chief centre of activity. The Cardinal-Legate Peter made another attempt at peaceful settlement (1178), but he was received with derision. The Third General Council of the Lateran (1179) renewed the previous severe measures and issued a summons to use force against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who were plundering and devastating Albi, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and the vicinity. At the death (1194) of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, Raymond V, his succession fell to <a href="../cathen/12670a.htm">Raymond VI</a> (1194-1222) who favoured the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. With the accession of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1198) the work of conversion and repression was taken up vigorously. In 1205-6 three events augured well for the success of the efforts made in that direction. <a href="../cathen/12670a.htm">Raymond VI</a>, in face of the threatening military operations urged by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> against him, promised under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to banish the dissidents from his dominions. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Fulco of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, formerly a troubadour, now became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1205-31). Two <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, Diego, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11339a.htm">Osma</a> and his companion, <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">Dominic Guzman (St. Dominic)</a>, returning from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, visited the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>. By their advice, the excessive outward splendour of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> preachers, which offended the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, was replaced by apostolical austerity. Religious disputations were renewed. St. Dominic, perceiving the great advantages derived by his opponents from the cooperation of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, founded (1206) at Pouille near Carcassonne a religious congregation for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, whose object was the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the poorer girls of the nobility. Not long after this he laid the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, in view of the immense spread of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which infected over 1000 cities or towns, called (1207) upon the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, as Suzerain of the County of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, to use force. He renewed his appeal on receiving news of the assassination of his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, <a href="../cathen/12079d.htm">Peter of Castelnau</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> (1208), which judging by appearances, he attributed to <a href="../cathen/12670a.htm">Raymond VI</a>. Numerous barons of northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> joined the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> were put at the head of the expedition, Arnold, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, and two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/12670a.htm">Raymond VI</a>, still under the ban of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> pronounced against him by <a href="../cathen/12079d.htm">Peter of Castelnau</a>, now offered to submit, was reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and took the field against his former friends. Roger, Viscount of B&eacute;ziers, was first attacked, and his principal fortresses, B&eacute;ziers and Carcassonne, were taken (1209). The monstrous words: "Slay all; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His own," alleged to have been uttered at the capture of B&eacute;ziers, by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, were never pronounced (Tamizey de Larroque, "Rev. des quest. hist." 1866, I, 168-91). Simon of Monfort, Earl of Leicester, was given control of the conquered territory and became the military leader of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/02159a.htm">Council of Avignon</a> (1209) <a href="../cathen/12670a.htm">Raymond VI</a> was again <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for not fulfilling the conditions of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reconciliation. He went in person to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the Pope ordered an investigation. After fruitless attempts in the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (1211) at an agreement between the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> and the Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, the latter left the council and prepared to resist. He was declared an enemy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and his possessions were forfeited to whoever would conquer them. Lavaur, Dep. of Tarn, fell in 1211, amid dreadful carnage, into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>. The latter, exasperated by the reported massacre of 6,000 of their followers, spared neither age nor sex. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> now degenerated into a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of conquest, and <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, in spite of his efforts, was powerless to bring the undertaking back to its original purpose. Peter of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, Raymond's brother-in-law, interposed to obtain his forgiveness, but without success. He then took up arms to defend him. The troops of Peter and of Simon of Montfort met at Muret (1213). Peter was defeated and killed. The allies of the fallen king were now so weakened that they offered to submit. The Pope sent as his representative the Cardinal-Deacon Peter of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Aquiro, who carried out only part of his instructions, receiving indeed Raymond, the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and others back into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but furthering at the same time Simon's plans of conquest. This commander continued the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and was appointed by the Council of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> (1215) lord over all the acquired territory. The Pope, informed that it was the only effectual means of crushing the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, approved the choice. At the death of Simon (1218), his son Amalric inherited his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and continued the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with but little success. The territory was ultimately ceded almost entirely by both Amalric and <a href="../cathen/12670b.htm">Raymond VII</a> to the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, while the Council of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1229) entrusted the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, which soon passed into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> (1233), with the repression of Albigensianism. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> disappeared about the end of the fourteenth century.
<h2 id="section3">Organization and liturgy</h2>

<p>The members of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> were divided into two classes: The "perfect" (<em>perfecti</em>) and the mere "believers" (<em>credentes</em>). The "perfect" were those who had submitted to the initiation-rite (<em>consolamentum</em>). They were few in number and were alone bound to the observance of the above-described rigid moral law. While the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> members of this class did not travel, the men went, by twos, from place to place, performing the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of initiation. The only bond that attached the "believers" to Albigensianism was the promise to receive the <em>consolamentum</em> before death. They were very numerous, could marry, wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, etc., and generally observed the ten commandments. Many remained "believers" for years and were only initiated on their deathbed. If the illness did not end fatally, starvation or poison prevented rather frequently subsequent moral transgressions. In some instances the <em>reconsolatio</em> was administered to those who, after initiation, had relapsed into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> consisted of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. The existence of an Albigensian Pope is not universally admitted. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were chosen from among the "perfect." They had two assistants, the older and the younger son (<em>filius major</em> and <em>filius minor</em>), and were generally succeeded by the former. The <em>consolamentum</em>, or <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of initiation, was a sort of spiritual <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, analogous in rite and equivalent in significance to several of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (Baptism, Penance, Order). Its reception, from which children were debarred, was, if possible, preceded by careful religious study and penitential practices. In this period of preparation, the candidates used ceremonies that bore a striking resemblance to the ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> catechumenate. The essential rite of the <em>consolamentum</em> was the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. The engagement which the "believers" took to be initiated before death was known as the <em>convenenza</em> (promise).
<h2 id="section4">Attitude of the Church</h2>

<p>Properly speaking, Albigensianism was not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> but an extra-Christian religion. Ecclesiastical authority, after persuasion had failed, adopted a course of severe repression, which led at times to regrettable excess. Simon of Montfort intended well at first, but later used the pretext of religion to usurp the territory of the Counts of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a> was, indeed, inflicted too freely on the Albigenses, but it must be remembered that the penal code of the time was considerably more rigorous than ours, and the excesses were sometimes provoked. <a href="../cathen/12670a.htm">Raymond VI</a> and his successor, <a href="../cathen/12670b.htm">Raymond VII</a>, were, when in distress, ever ready to promise, but never to earnestly amend. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> was justified in saying that the Albigenses were "worse than the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>"; and still he counselled moderation and disapproved of the selfish policy adopted by Simon of Montfort. What the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> combated was principles that led directly not only to the ruin of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but to the very extinction of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.
