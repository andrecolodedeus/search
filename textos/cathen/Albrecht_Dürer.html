<h1>Albrecht D&uuml;rer</h1>  

<p>Celebrated <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and engraver, born at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, 21 May, 1471; died there, 6 April, 1528. D&uuml;rer left his native city, then famous for its commerce, learning, and art, but three times in his life. His first journey was undertaken after he had completed his apprenticeships both to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, a goldsmith, and to the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and engraver Wohlgemut; on this occasion, he traveled through <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and visited at Colmar and Basle the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the recently deceased <a href="../cathen/13553c.htm">Schongaur</a>; in 1505-07 he spent some time in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; in 1520-21 he went to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, visiting especially Antwerp.
<h2>First period (before 1505)</h2>

<p>After the earliest works of his youth (portraits, Madonnas, coats-of-arms, landscape-sketches) he set up in 1494 a studio of his own. In the same year he married Agnes Frey but they had no children. Among his <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> friends the learned <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> <a href="../cathen/12108b.htm">Willibald Pirkheimer</a> held the first place. Besides great advancement in learning, D&uuml;rer owed to <a href="../cathen/12108b.htm">Pirkheimer</a> the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of a lifelong friendship and the acquaintance with classical antiquity which he occasionally drew upon in his work. D&uuml;rer's art, however, with its sources in the German <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, remained essentially German; the influence of the art of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> was merely supplementary. In his own century there were few chances for mural <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>; but the demand for altar-pieces and portraits was all the greater. His woodcuts were eagerly sought after by the general public, his engravings on copper by connoisseurs. Among his fine compositions are: the Baumgartner* altar-painting, the central panel of which represents the Adoration of the Christ Child, the wings the donors as Sts. George and Eustacious; the "Lamentation of Christ" in which the pathos is noteworthy; and the remarkable picture of himself (1500). These are preserved in the Alte Pinakothek in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. The portrait of himself just mentioned is greatly idealized as is also that of a lady of the Furleger <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. On the other hand in the portraits of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a> realism predominates. But here, as in the "Prodigal Son." and in his drawings, D&uuml;rer seeks to elevate his <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> by sweet simplicity, depth of feeling, and grandeur of conception. The "Adoration of the Magi" in the Uffizi at Florence will bear comparison, at least for German taste, with the masterpieces of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. D&uuml;rer's own woodcuts have a quality entirely their own; though without colouring, they yet produced the effect of colour. "The Apocalypse" (15 cuts) is distinguished by its daring fancy and grandeur of composition . The most striking of the series are: the "Four Riders", the "Angels of the Euphrates", and the "Battle of the Angels with the Dragon". To the same period belong, for the most part, the powerful "Larger Passion" (7, later 20, cuts) as well as the beautiful "Life of the Virgin" (16, later 20, cuts), in which the scenes from the life of the Holy Family in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> have all the sweetness of a charming idyll. Mention should be made of the so-called "Green Passion" in the Albertina Museum at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, a series of twelve drawings with pen on green paper, also of the "Smaller Passion" of a later date in 37 woodcuts, and of the 17 copperplate engravings on the same subject. For the fifth time the artist came back to the Passion of Christ eight years before his death; a few sketches are to be found in the Uffizi at Florence and in the Albertina at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Wood and copperplate engraving were brought to great perfection by D&uuml;rer; the latter, and etchings as well, by his own work; the former by his directions to the wood-engravers who carried out his designs.
<h2>Second period (1505-1520)</h2>

<p>In "The Festival of the Rosary", <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> for German merchants residing there, he competes, not unsuccessfully, with the Italian colourists, though it may be said that colour was not his strong point. The <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> (Abbey of Strahow, Prague) is damaged, but a good copy is preserved in the Imperial Museum at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. An oil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of the same period, "Christ on the Cross", and other works that followed, e.g. "Adam and Eve" (Madrid and Florence), show that D&uuml;rer's trip to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the acquaintance made there with Giovanni Bellini were not without profit to his art; but D&uuml;rer's nationality and the independence of his genius are always evident. Another work much admired was the so-called Heller <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a>, destroyed in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> in 1674 by fire. Valuable studies for this picture and an indistinct copy are still extant. One of the finest examples of German art is the "Adoration of the Trinity" or "All Saints" (1511). Placed beside the "Disputa" of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> or the Sistine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michaelangelo</a>, produced in the same year, it would not suffer from the comparison. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> sits upon a throne and holds forth the Cross with the Crucified; above both of them, in the form of a dove, the Holy Ghost hovers. About them the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in two companies with the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> at their head kneel in adoration. In the upper part of the picture, above the blessed hosts, choirs of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> surround the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>; in the lower part, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Militant, led by the powerful figure of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and an emperor, takes part in the adoration. As an idealization of the world this multitude stands above the clouds. At the very bottom and to one side, as though left behind, is seen the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> figure of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. This work deserves no less praise for its perfection of finish than for its sublimity of conception. The frame, carved in <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style from drawings by D&uuml;rer, is still preserved at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>. In the same year, 1511, D&uuml;rer produced the "Virgin with the Pear", one of the finest of his Madonnas. In the years 1513-14 he executed three great copperplate engravings: these may, perhaps, be looked upon as ideal representations of a fearless <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>, an unsatisfied searcher for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and a saint <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and are called: "The Knight with Death and the Devil"; "Melancholia"; "Saint Jerome in His Study". To these must be added various <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, e.g. of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, Sigmund, and Albrecht of Brandenburg; further, the marginal drawings, displaying much fancy and humour, made for Maximillian's "Prayer Book", and the "Triumphal Arch of Maximillian" belong to the same time. Later, D&uuml;rer worked also on the "Triumph of Maximillian", and produced the large "Triumphal Car", for the emperor.
<h2>Third period (1520-1528)</h2>

<p>Admirable sketches for "St. Jerome with the Skull", lately discovered by Anton Weber in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, give ample <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the artist's diligence during his stay in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. The striking head of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> is very like the "Head of an Old Man" in the Albertina. After his return to <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, D&uuml;rer <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a noteworthy "Head of Christ", and portraits of Pinkheimer, <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, and Holzschuher. His last work of importance (1526) was the "Four Apostles", Peter with John and Paul with Mark; these <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> which are now in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, are much admired for the individuality of character expressed by the figures and the fine treatment of the drapery. From the inscription under these pictures, despite the fact that Peter is represented as holding the keys of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and from other circumstances that prove little, some have wished to infer that towards the end of his life became attached to the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. But even the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> van Eye, A. W. Becker, C, Kinkle, and others, do not share in this opinion, and M. Thausing, the great D&uuml;rer scholar, has now rejected it. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> many well-disposed <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the time saw the necessity of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform and hoped it would be hastened by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> stand. But they were deceived and acknowledged it, as <a href="../cathen/12108b.htm">Pirkheimer</a> did for himself and his friend: "I confess that in the beginning I believed in <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, like our Albert of blessed memory...but as anyone can see, the situation has become worse." In the years 1525-27, D&uuml;rer wrote three books: on geometry, the proportions of the human figure, and the art of fortification.
