<h1>Albrecht von Eyb</h1>  

<p>One of the earliest German <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a>, born in 1420 near Anabach in Franconia; died in 1475. After preliminary studies at Erfurt he went to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> study at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">Universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/11593a.htm">Pavia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">Bologna</a>. He returned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1451, having in the meantime been appointed canon at <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a> and <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. From 1452 to 1459 he was again a student at <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">Bologna</a>, winning the degree of doctor of canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. He was also <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by an appointment as chamberlain to <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>. After his return to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> he resided chiefly at <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>. In 1462 he became <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, not, however, without encountering <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> opposition from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Eyb as a partisan of the Hohenzollern Margrave, Albrecht Achilles. Little is known of his last years.

<p>Eyb's best known and most important work is his "Eheb&uuml;chlein" (Book on Marriage), in which he discusses the question whether a man should take a lawful wife or not. It was published in 1472. In 1460 he had written on the same theme in Latin "An viro sapienti uxor sit ducenda". The German work treats of the joys and sorrows of married life and general maxims of a <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> or <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> character are added. A decision is finally rendered in favour of the married state. The popularity of the book is attested by the fact that between 1472 and 1540 no less than twelve reprints were issued. Another work of Eyb is the "Margarita poetica" (Nuremberg, 1472), a textbook of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> rhetoric, consisting of a collection of passages in prose and verse from Latin authors, to which are added specimens of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> eloquence. In 1474 Eyb finished his "Spiegel der Sitten" (Mirror of Morals), a lengthy work of <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> and moral content, probably based on some Latin original. The book did not meet with the favour shown to the "Eheb&uuml;chlein" and was not printed until 1511. Appended to it are German translations of two of Plautus's comedies, the "Menaechmi" and the "Bacchides" as well as of Ugolini's"Philogenia". Eyb's writings have been edited by K. M&uuml;ller (Sondershausen, 1879); the best edition is that of M. Herrmann, "Deutsche Schriften des Albrecht von Eyb" (Berlin, 1895).
