<h1>Aldersbach</h1>  

<p>A former <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey in the valley of the Vils in Lower <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. It was founded in 1127 by <a href="../cathen/11353a.htm">St. Otto</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, and the first community was composed of canons regular. The site chosen was near a church <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 880 by Englmar, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Peter. In 1146 Egilbert, the successor of Otto, gave the foundation and a new church of Our Lady to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, and after the departure of the canons, Abbot Sefried, with <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Ebrach, took possession. Under <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> rule Aldersbach flourished for more than six centuries. It was famous for the rigour of its religious <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> and exerted a wide influence. From its <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> came the first communities established at F&uuml;rstenfeld (1263), F&uuml;rstenzell (1274), and Gotteszell (1285). The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> cultivated the soil and devoted themselves to the works of the ministry in their own and in the neighbouring churches dependent upon the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Nor was the pursuit of learning neglected. The first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Sefried, formed the nucleus of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> to which valuable additions were made by his successors. Abbots and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> carried on their studies not only in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, but also at the great <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, Heidelberg, and Ingolstadt. Aldersbach suffered from time to time from the ravages of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> which followed the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, it was pillaged and almost entirely abandoned. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, however, escaped destruction, and under the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> Matthew and Gebhard Horger the old r&eacute;gime was restored. Abbot Theobald II repaired the injuries sustained during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the Spanish and Austrian Successions. When the Abbey was suppressed, 1 April, 1803, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> numbered forty. The buildings were sold, and the Abbey church was converted into a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, while the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work or teaching. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> became a part of the National Library at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. Aldersbach was fortunate in the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> who were chosen to rule its destinies. They maintained monastic <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, furthered the interests of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and encouraged the pursuit of learning. Among the more prominent, besides those already mentioned, were Dietrich I (1239-53, 1258-77); Conrad (1308-36); John II, John III, and Wolfgang Marius. The last-named is perhaps the best known. He had studied at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a>, and was the author of several works, While Theobald II was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, one of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, P. Balduin Wurzer, taught at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. <a href="../cathen/15618d.htm">Father Stephan Wiest</a> also became known later as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>. He taught at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the University (1787-88), and six years later returned to Aldersbach, where he died in 1797.
