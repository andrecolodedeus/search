<h1>Aleppo</h1>  

<p>Armenian Rite <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. The city of Aleppo is situated in the plain that stretches from the Orontes to the Euphrates in the northwestern extremity of the Syrian <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. It rises in the middle of an oasis on the eight little hills, and is watered by the Kouik. Ancient <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> records mention this town. According to an <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> tradition, Abraham lived in it, and distributed some milk to every comer, whence the town's name, <em>Haleb</em>. Seleucus Nicator (311-280 B.C.) gave it the name of <a href="../cathen/02513b.htm">Beroea</a> (Berrhoe) by which it was known in early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times. Its present <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> name dates from the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> conquest in 630. It belonged to the Seljukids from 1090 to 1117; to the Ortokids from 1117 to 1183 (besieged by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> 1124); to the Ayoubites from 1183 to 1260 (Mongol Invasion); and to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Sultans. In 1317 it passed definitively to the Ottoman <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, except for the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> occupation, 1833-39. Today it is the chief residence of a vilayet of the same name. In ancient times Aleppo was a commercial depot for the trade between <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, the regions along the Tigris and Euphrates, and the Mediterranean. Although it has long lost much of its importance, it still sends to Alexandria the products of Diarbekir, Mossoul, and Baghdad. It is noted for its fertile gardens and its healthy climate. A more disagreeable peculiarity is the ulcer known as the "Aleppo button". The plague raged there in 1822. Its ramparts and forts have fallen into decay. Among the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> monuments are a Roman aqueduct and a beautiful mosque of the Seljukid epoch. The population is about 127,000 of whom 97,450 are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> (Arabs, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, etc.), 19,200 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (Greeks, United or <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, Chaldeans, and Latins), 2,800 non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (mostly Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>), and 7,800 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Four <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> govern the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, the Syrians, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>. The Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> are administered by a Vartabet appointed by the <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of Sis. The Orthodox Greeks are very rare in the town, but quite numerous in the surrounding country. They constitute a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> diocese, which separated from the Patriarchate of Antioch in 1757, and was restored to it by the Patriarchate of Constantinople in August, 1888. In the eighteenth century the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, Gerassimus (d. 1783, at <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a>) was a stern enemy of the union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Aleppo remains the centre of the French <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. In 1625 the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> established themselves there; somewhat later they retired to Mount Carmel, where they built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. (They had also in the orient other stations.) In Aleppo they were succeeded by the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> from 1785 to 1869. In 1873 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> founded a mission at Aleppo. In 1626 the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> organized a "Custodia" from which were directed twelve missions. Their activity was interrupted by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and in 1808 these <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> missions were given to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. The latter founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in 1859. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> direct a boarding-school. There are also <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionaries in Aleppo. It has 260 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>: 115 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a>, 116 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and 29 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Israelite</a>.
