<h1>Alessandro Farnese</h1>  

<p>The name of two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. For the elder see <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">POPE PAUL III</a>. The young Alessandro Farnese &#151; eldest son of Pier Luigi Farnese, first Duke of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and brother [actually his son &#151; <em>Ed.</em>] of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> &#151; was born 7 Oct, 1520, and died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Feb., 1589. While yet a student at Bologna, in 1534, <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> appointed him administrator of the <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Diocese of Parma</a>; on 18 Dec. of the same year, his uncle, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of the Title of Sant' Angelo, and conferred on him numerous offices and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. Thus, he was Vice-Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>, Governor of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, Archpriest of St. Mary Major's, Archpriest of St. Peter's, Administrator of <a href="../cathen/08267a.htm">Ja&eacute;n</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15496b.htm">Vizeu</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, of Wurzburg, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon, France</a>. In 1536 he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10508a.htm">Monreale</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, where, in 1552, he founded Jesuit College, and in 1559 convoked a synod. He was also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Massa (1538), and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (1553), later exchanging this see for that of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, from which he resigned in 1557; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> (1556); of <a href="../cathen/10529a.htm">Montefiascone</a> (1571); finally <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia and Velletri</a> (1580). He was <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for the province of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony</a>, and afterwards of the county of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where he displayed great administrative ability, especially during the plague of 1541.

<p>He was very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in behalf of the poor. Farnese was employed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> on various legations and embassies. In 1539, he was <em>legatus a latere</em> of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> at the court of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, to make peace between the emperor and the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and to sever the alliance with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, also to arrange for a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. In 1543 he went again to the court of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, and later to that of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, and was present at the meeting of the two sovereigns in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, returning with Charles to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between his brother Ottavio, Duke of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Pope Julius III</a>, he prudently held aloof, first at Florence and then at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. In 1545 he went on a second embassy to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> in reference to the council, and in 1546 he accompanied the pontifical troops sent the aid of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> against the Smalkald League. In 1580, he was one of the candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> greatly admired his virtues and sagacity. Farnese was an ardent promoter of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> reforms. Above all he was a lover and patron of literature, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and art, especially <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>. He used to say that "there is nothing more despicable than a cowardly soldier, or an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>". He patronized the architect Vignolo, to whom he trusted the construction both of the church of Gesu in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, of which he laid the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> 1568, and of the superb Farnese palace of Caprarola near Lago Bracciano. He restored the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> Tre Fontane, where he had the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Scala Coeli erected: and he had the ceiling of San Lorenzo in Damaso magnificently decorated. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in front of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> in the church of Gesu.
