<h1>Alessandro Scarlatti</h1>  

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, either at <a href="../cathen/15023a.htm">Trapani</a> or at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, in 1659; died at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> 24 Oct., 1725; buried there in the musicians' <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Montesanto. On his tombstone he is called <em>musices instaurator maximus</em>, which title he deserves in that he originated the classical style of the eighteenth century, and gave a high development to concerted instrumental music. the scenes of his activity were alternately <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. His first opera (1679), "Gli Equivoci nel Sembiante" was performed at the palace of Queen Christina of Sweden, who lived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after her abdication and conversion to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Five years later we find him in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, where he obtained the position of <em>Maestro di capella</em> to the Viceroy. He remained there for about eighteen years.

<p>After a short stay at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1702), where he was made assistant maestro and afterwards maestro at S. Maria Maggiore. In 1708 or 1709 he returned to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and lived there for ten years. He lived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from 1718 until 1721, thence proceeding to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, where he died in 1725. His fertility of production is astonishing. He wrote more than a hundred operas (of which less than half are extant). It is said that he composed two hundred Masses, which is questionable, as but few survived him; he left several Oratorios, the best of which are "Agar ed Ismaele", "La Vergine addolorata", and "S. Filippo Neri"; many <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motets</a> and innumerable chamber-cantatas and serenatas. Moreover he shows great capacity in his compositions for the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a>, the cembalo, and other instruments. Not all his <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">religious music</a> is for <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use; but many of his compositions, although in his days the Palestrinian-style was fast declining, are written in severe and noble polyphony. We may quote here his mass for Cardinal Ottoboni (edited by <a href="../cathen/12486a.htm">Proske</a>), his "Missa ad usum Cappellae Pontificiae" (recently found by Giulio Bas in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Academy of S. Cecilia at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and published by L. Schwann at Dusseldorf), his famous "Tu es Petrus" performed in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by the Roman singers at the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a> (printed by Ricordi of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>).

<p>His great distinction in the musical world was to have laid the foundation for the new style, afterwards brought to perfection by the most famous composers, not only of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which was in great part formed by his influence (Leo, Durante, <a href="../cathen/11667b.htm">Pergolesi</a>), but also of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (<a href="../cathen/07158b.htm">Haydn</a>, <a href="../cathen/10623a.htm">Mozart</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15265b.htm">Beethoven</a>). Domenico Alessandro's eldest son was born at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> 26 Oct., 1685 (in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> register he is called Giuseppe Domenico), and died in 1757. The esteem in which Alessandro was held, may be seen from the fact that Domenico's godfather was the Duke of Addaloni, and his godmother the Princess of Colobrano. Domenico made himself famous by his great skill on the harpsichord. Ricordi of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> has published his works for the clavicembalo, in six volumes, under the supervision of Alessasdro Longo (1906). The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of these are chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of S. Marco at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. The compositions are not of equal merit. His genius often seems to forecast the style of the next century. For a few years (1715-1719) he was choirmaster in S. Peter's <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; during four years (1721-1725), he was engaged at the Court of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>; for twenty-five years he was at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> (1729-1754), but spent the last years of his life again in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, where he died. Of Francesco, brother of Alessandro, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in 1684 he became violinist in the royal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, that fifteen years later his <a href="../cathen/11270a.htm">oratorio</a>, "Agnus occisus ab origine mundi", was sung in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that in 1720 he gave a concert in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where Domenico was staying at the same time. Giuseppe Scarlatti was either grandson or nephew of Alessandro (<em>nipote</em> can have the two meanings). Born at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> 1712, he died in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1777 where he was considered a distinguished composer. He left several operas.
