<h1>Alessio</h1>  

<p>(<em>Lissus, Alexiensis</em>).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Turkey, since 1886 suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a>. It is one of the principal seaports of <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albania</a>, is favourably located near the mouth of the Drin, was founded by Dionysius of Syracuse, and was an important and beautiful city in the time of Diodorus Siculus. It is now known as Alise, Lesch, Eschenderari, or Mrtav. Like all the cities of <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albania</a>, it frequently changed masters in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> until the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> took possession of it in 1386. It still belonged to them when Skanderbeg died, but shortly afterwards it fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. In 1501 the inhabitants again returned to the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> domination, but in the year 1506 Sultan Bajazet obtained the restitution of the city, after it had been evacuated and deprived of its ramparts. Today it is a poor straggling hamlet of about 2,000 people, on third of whom are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In it, however, the mountaineers hold a weekly bazaar where very large transactions take place. The Acrolissus or citadel is interesting for the well preserved Roman cisterns and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> arches it still holds. The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Alessio is <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>, who attended the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> in 340. It does not figure prominently in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> until the sixth century, when it is mentioned as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in the correspondence of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (590-604). Since the end of the fourteenth century, when it came under <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> rule, it has had again a series of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>Alessio had formerly five churches. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas</a> and once held the mortal remains of the patriot George Castriota, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> Skanderbeg, who died in 1467. Local tradition relates that when the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> took the town they opened his grave and made amulets of his bones, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that these would confer indomitable <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> on the wearer. Transformed into a mosque, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was abandoned by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottomans</a> after three dervishes had successively committed <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> from one of its towers. Two other churches dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a> and to St. Sebastian still survive as mosques. The population is mostly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (about 14,000), attended by fifteen <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, elected 24 May, 1870, is Monsignor Francis Malczyinski, an alumnus of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. He resides at Calmeti, a little distance from Alessio.

<p>At the summit of a group of rocky hills, on the west bank of the Drin, facing the town, are the church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a> under the care of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, a last remnant of the thirty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> they once possessed in <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albania</a>. The site is said to have been chosen by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> himself, and is greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, especially by the mountaineers of <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a> who make an annual <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to it on 13 June, and exhibit on that occasion a very striking <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> themselves respect the church and confide their treasures to the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> whenever they have reason to fear the rapacity of their pashas.

<p>Within the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> limits of Alessio is the quasi-episcopal <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> (<em>abbatia nullius</em>) of St. Alexander Orosci or Orochi, the mountain stronghold of the small but <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> body of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Mirdites of Albania. Since 1888 it enjoys an independent <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over this faithful and warlike people which in 1894 obtained from the Porte, through the good offices of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> for its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and thereby freed itself from the irksome protectorate of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> had <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over about 18,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with 16 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 13 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 11 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and 2 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, elected in 1888, is Monsignor Primo Dochi, an alumnus of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>.
