<h1>Alexander Bicknor</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. 1349. As his surname suggests he came from a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Kent, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He was elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> in 1310, being at that time <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">Prebendary</a> of Maynooth and Treasurer of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. This selection was, however, set aside by Edward II in favour of Lech who soon died; after this, in May, 1314, Edward petitioned <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Pope Clement V</a> to confirm Bicknor's appointment. The request was earnestly repeated in 1317, and he was finally <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 22 July of this year. In 1318 he was appointed Lord Justice of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. On some unrecorded ground his name appears as attending the English Parliament, and he took part on 24 September, 1318, in <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> at St. Paul's the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of Robert Bruce. Even though, as a diplomatist, he was frequently absent from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he showed his interest in it by building an episcopal residence, and he endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to attach a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> to St. Patrick's Cathedral. In 1323 he was in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> on an embassy, in 1324 he was engaged in negotiating peace with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and in arranging a Spanish match for Edward, Prince of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. In this he failed; and on his return Edward II charged him with the loss of La Rozelle. About this time he joined with Queen Isabella in concerting the overthrow of the Despensers, then the royal favourites. On 28 May, 1325, Edward II asked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to remove Bicknor from the kingdom, accusing him of the surrender of La Rozelle, of defaming Hugh Despenser, of improperly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> Robert Pinchbeck, and of not accounting for sums received while Treasurer of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Bicknor joined Queen Isabella and others in declaring Prince Edward guardian of the kingdom, at an assembly at <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a>; later, in 1327, he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> publicly at the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Guildhall to maintain the queen's cause as against the king. In 1329 Edward seized his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> revenues as a set-off to the sums unaccounted for by Bicknor as Treasurer of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In 1330 Bicknor became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> collector. He quarrelled with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a>, who, on appeal to Edward II, was banished for nine years during which period Bicknor, as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, visited the <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">See of Ossory</a> and seized the revenues. In 1348 Bicknor held a synod at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> at which useful disciplinary decrees were passed. He engaged in a dispute with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a> about the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the primacy of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.
