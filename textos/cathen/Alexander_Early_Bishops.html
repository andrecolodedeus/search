<h1>Alexander (Early Bishops)</h1>  

<h2>Alexander of Antioch</h2>

<p>Thirty-eighth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> (413-421), praised by Theodoret (<a href="../fathers/27025.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.35</a>) "for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and austerity of his life, his contempt of riches, his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of wisdom, and powerful eloquence." He healed the last remnants of the Meletian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and obtained at Constantinople the restitution of the name of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> (registers).
<h2>Alexander of Apamea</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the Council of Ephesus (431), and one of the eight <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> deputed by the party of <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>.
<h2>Alexander of Basilinopolis</h2>

<p>In Bithynia, a friend of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, to whom he owed his appointment as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; after the fall of his patron he retired (c. 410) to his native Ptolemais in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where he experienced the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus of Antioch</a> and the private friendship of Synesius (Epp. 61,67).
<h2>Alexander of Byzantium</h2>

<p>As Constantinople was then called, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that see during the original <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> troubles. He was 73 years old when appointed (313 or 317), and governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for 23 years. He supported his namesake of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> against Arius, took part in the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> (325) and refused to admit the arch-heretic to communion, though threatened with <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposition</a> and exile. The sudden death of Arius was looked on by contemporary <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as an answer to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the good <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whom Theodoret (<a href="../fathers/27021.htm"><em>Church History</em> I.3</a>) calls an "apostolic" man. He did not long survive this tragic event.
<h2>Alexander of Hierapolis (Euphratensis)</h2>

<p>An unbending opponent of St. Cyril in the Council of Ephesus (431), and an equally stanch advocate of Nestorius. Even when <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a> and most of the Oriental <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> yielded, and a general reconciliation was effected, Alexander stood out against "the abomination of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>". His character is vividly portrayed in the correspondence of his friend and admirer, the historian Theodoret, as that of a grave, holy, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man, beloved by his people, but hopelessly stubborn along the line of what seemed to him the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. After the exhaustion of all measures to overcome his resistance, he was banished by imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to the mines of Phamuthin in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where he died (Tillemont, Mem., XIV, XV).
<h2>Alexander of Jerusalem</h2>

<p>The friend of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and his fellow student at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> under Pant&aelig;nus and Clement. He became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in Cappadocia (or Cilicia?) early in the third century, entertained for a time his master Clement, and himself suffered <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for the Faith (204-212). On his release, he visited <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and was chosen coadjutor to Narcissus, the elderly occupant of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. This was the first case of an episcopal translation and coadjutorship. and had to be ratified by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of Palestine assembled at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Valesius in Eus., Hist Eccl., VI, 11; <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../fathers/26017.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.36</a>). The first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was formed by him at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.20</a>). He defended <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> against his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Demetrius, when the latter had taken offence at the permission accorded <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> to expound the scriptures publicly in the church of Caesarea in the presence of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the latter being the only authoritative exponents of the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a>. Alexander and Theoctistus (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>) wrote a joint letter to Demetrius, in which they pleaded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> usage of other places (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.19</a>). In the end <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by his two protectors (c. 230). He bears personal testimony at the beginning of his first <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on the Books of Kings, to the amiable character of Alexander. The latter died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at Caesarea (251) during the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Some fragments of his letters are preserved in the sixth book of the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius.
