<h1>Alexander Leopold Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf&uuml;rst</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>, famous for his many supposedly <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cures, born 17 August, 1794, at Kupferzell in <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>; died 14 November, 1849, at V&ouml;slau near <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. He studied the humanities at the Theresianum in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1804-8, and at <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, 1808-10; philosophy at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1810-12; <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at Tyrnau in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, 1812-14, and at <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, 1814-15. On 16 September, 1815, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and at once devoted himself to the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> first at Stuttgart, then at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. In October, 1816, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he had little difficulty in justifying himself against the accusations of having administered the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a> and of belonging to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> Society. On his return he made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Loreto, and again arrived at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> on 23 March, 1817. On 8 June of the same year he was made <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> councillor, and, in 1821, canon of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. About this time began the numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cures which are alleged to have been effected through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Hohenlohe. On 1 February, 1821, he was suddenly cured at Hassfurt of a severe pain in the throat in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of a devout peasant named Martin Michel. His <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was greatly strengthened by this cure, and on 21 June, 1821, he succeeded in curing the Princess Mathilda von Schwarzenberg, who had been a paralytic for eight years, by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which he joined with those of Martin Michel. Having asked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> whether he was permitted to attempt similar cures in the future, he was told not to attempt any more public cures, but he continued them in private. He would specify a time during which he would <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for those that applied to him, and in this manner he effected numerous cures not only on the Continent, but also in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Worthy of mention is the case of Mrs. Ann Mattingly of Washington, D. C., who was said to have been cured of a tumour through his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> on 10 March, 1824. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> did not pass judgment on these supposed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were divided in their opinion. In 1824 Hohenlohe became canon, in 1829 <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> and Administrator of <a href="../cathen/07040a.htm">Grosswardein</a>. In 1844 he was made <em><a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a></em> and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>. He is the author of four volumes of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> and <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> treatises most of which were collected and published by <a href="../cathen/03013a.htm">S. Brunner</a> (Ratisbon, 1851). His method of curing the sick was continued after his death by his friend and disciple Joseph Forster, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of H&uuml;ttenheim, who died in 1875.
