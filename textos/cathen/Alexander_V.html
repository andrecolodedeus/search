<h1>Alexander V</h1>  

<p>Pietro Philarghi, born c. 1339, on the island of Crete (Candia), whence his appellation, Peter of Candia; <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">elected</a> 26 June, 1409; died at Bologna, 3 May, 1410.

<p>A homeless beggar-boy in a Cretan city, knowing neither <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> nor relations, he became the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of a discerning <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, from whom he received an elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and under whose guidance he became a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> in a Cretan <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The youth gave promise of extraordinary ability, and was sent to enjoy the superior <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> advantages of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He studied later at Oxford and finally at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where he distinguished himself as professor, preacher, and writer. He is the author of a good commentary on the "Sentences" of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>. During his stay at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Great Schism</a> (1378-1417) rent the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and Philarghi was ranged among the partisans of <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> (1375-89). Returning to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he found a place in the court of Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where he acted as tutor to his sons and ambassador on important missions. Through the favour of the Visconti he was made successively <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, in 1386; of <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, in 1387; of Navoya, in 1389; and finally <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, in 1402. In 1405 <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Pope Innocent VII</a> made him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, and turned his ability and his friendship with the Visconti to advantage by confirming him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. Henceforth his history becomes a part of that of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Schism</a>. The Cardinal of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> was foremost among the advocates of a council. To this end he approved of the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> from their obedience, sanctioned the agreement of the rival <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">colleges of cardinals</a> to join in a common effort for unity, and negotiated with Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> to secure <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England's</a> neutrality. He thus incurred the displeasure of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, who deprived him of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and even declared him to be shorn of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> dignity. At the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> (25 March, 1409) Cardinal Philarghi was the leading spirit. He preached the opening sermon, a scathing condemnation of the tenacity of the rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and presided at the deliberations of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who declared these <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics.

<p>On 26 June, 1409, he was the unanimous choice of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to fill the presumably vacant Papal Chair. His stainless character, vast erudition, world-wide experience, and tried administrative ability, together with the fact that he had neither country nor relations in the riven <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world to favour, gave promise of glory to the Papacy and peace to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Alexander V soon found all nations in sympathy with him, save <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> and some Italian cities whose interests were bound up in the legitimacy of the stubborn <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. He was destined, however, to rule but ten months. His pontificate was marked by unsuccessful efforts to reach <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, then in control of King Ladislas of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, whom Alexander deprived of his kingdom in favour of Louis II of Anjou. Detained by Cardinal Cossa in Bologna, the stronghold of that self-seeking adviser, he died there under circumstances which led the enemies of Cossa, who succeeded Alexander V as <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, to bring before the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> the now discredited charge that he had poisoned the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Pisan</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Alexander lived long enough to disappoint the hopes his election inspired. His legitimacy was soon questioned and the world was chagrined to find that instead of two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> it now had three. His ardour for reform diminished. Generous to a fault, he scattered favours with undiscriminating munificence. The <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> were unduly favoured by being confirmed in privileges which <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties resented as encroaching on their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Whether or not Alexander was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is a question which canonists and historians of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Schism</a> still discuss. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has not pronounced a definite opinion nor is it at all likely that she will. The Roman "Gerarchia Cattolica", not an authoritative work, which prior to 1906 contained a chronological list of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, designated Alexander V as the 211th <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, succeeding <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, resigned. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/11451b.htm">PAPACY</a>.) His remains are <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Francis at Bologna in a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> magnificently restored in 1889 under the direction of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>.

<div class="stiki"><em>Editor's Note:</em> A New Advent reader offers this information on Pope Alexander V: "Pope Alexander V was not born in the Island of Crete, which at that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> bore the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> name of "Candia." He was born in the hamlet of Candia in Lomellina, south of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, which exists today in the Italian region of <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, but at that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Duchy of Milan</a>. He was a Crusinallo from the Counts Crusinallo. Crusinallo is today a suburb of Omegna on the northern shore of Lake Orta, which is north of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>. In the enclosed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> on the Island of S. Giulio, on Lake Orta, there is a fresco depicting Pope Alexander V <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a>, accompanied by the <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> of the Crusinallos and encircled by a Latin <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscription</a> which describes him as Pope Alexander V of the Crusinallo <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>."</div>
