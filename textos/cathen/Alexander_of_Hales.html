<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Alexander of Hales</h1>  

<p>Franciscan, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, one of the greatest of the scholastics, born at Hales, or Hailles, in Gloucestershire, towards the end of the twelfth century; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1245. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in his native village, and probably also at Oxford. After having finished his studies in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he went to the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and there attained the <a href="../cathen/01759a.htm">Master's degree</a>, first in the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> (philosophy), and afterwards in that of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. From a remark made by <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a> it is inferred that, in 1210, Alexander was <em>Magister regens</em> in the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a>, and this is the first date of his biography that is certain. Roger is also our authority (though not the only one) that Alexander became <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>; but whether the title was conferred by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> or by an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, is uncertain. In 1220, Alexander joined the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, in which he soon became one of the most celebrated teachers. In 1231, he entered the order of St. Francis, continuing, however, to perform, as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a licensed teacher of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, a fact which was of the utmost importance both for the University and for the course of studies in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. Alexander died at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of his Order in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.

<p>In the chronicles and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises of the fourteenth century we find Alexander styled <em>Doctor irrefragabilis, Fons Vitae, Theologorum monarcha.</em> His principal work is the "Summa Universae Theologiae", begun about the year 1231 and left unfinished. The third part is defective, especially the portion treating of the virtues and other questions in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. To supply this defect, the "Summa Virtutum" was composed by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> William of Melitona, though the work was, and is still sometimes, ascribed to Alexander himself. It is now agreed that not Alexander of Hales, but Alexander of Bonini is the author of the "Commentaries" on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> "Metaphysics" and "De Anima". The "Summa Theologiae" has been several times published (Venice, 1475, 1576; Nuremberg, 1481, 1502; Pavia, 1481; Cologne, 1622). A critical edition has recently been promised by Quaracchi editors of the works of <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>. Alexander's other works (<a href="../cathen/13400a.htm">Salimbene</a>, a contemporary, speaks of his "many writings") are still unpublished.

<p>Alexander's importance for the history of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and philosophy lies in the fact, that he was the first to attempt a systematic exposition of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, after the metaphysical and physical works of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> had become known to the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">schoolmen</a>. His is not the first "Summa". The collections of "Sentences" which were current in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> since the days of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, were summaries of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and were often so titled in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. So that Alexander had many Summists as predecessors, as predecessors for instance: <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, Roland, Omnebene, <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, Stephen Langton, <a href="../cathen/13097c.htm">Robert of Melun</a>, <a href="../cathen/11773b.htm">Peter of Poitiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/15631d.htm">William of Auxerre</a>, and Robert Pulleyn. His, however, is the first "Summa" in which use was made of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> physical, metaphysical, and <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> treatises. <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> did not quote <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> once. Alexander quotes him in almost every <em>Quaestio</em>; he quotes also Arabian commentators, especially <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, and thus prepares the way for Albert, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, St. Bonaventure, and <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> for whom <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> was <em>the</em> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. The "Summa" is divided into four parts: the first treats of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Trinity, etc.; the second, of creatures, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, etc.; the third of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Redemption, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> law; the fourth, of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Each part is divided into Questions, each Question into Members, each Member into Articles. The method is a development of that employed by <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> in his "Yea and Nay", and is practically that with which readers of St. Thomas are familiar. The article opens with a recital of the objections, then follows the thesis, with <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, scriptural, patristic, and rational, and at the end of the article, under the title "Resolutio" are given the answers to the objections.

<p>Alexander's <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is, in its main outlines, identical with that of St. Bonaventure and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. Thus he starts with the question of the knowableness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and decides that, while the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is, no created mind can comprehend what He is. In enumerating the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, he lays stress on St. Augustine's argument from the need of an absolute <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, on Saint Anselm's ontological argument, on <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor's</a> argument from consciousness, and on the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> argument from <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>. He teaches that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the exemplar, efficient and final cause of all things, that He is the Creator and Preserver of all things, that He is pure Actuality (<em>Actus Purus</em>), all things else being composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form. This latter point, the coextensiveness of matter with created being, later on became a distinctive tenet of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> School. On the problem of <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">Universals</a>, Alexander takes up the position of a metaphysician and <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychologist</a>, and thus reaches a conclusion to which his predecessors of the twelfth century, who argued the question solely from the point of view of dialectics, could never have attained; he teaches that <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">Universals</a> exist <em>ante rem</em>, in the mind of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and also <em>in re</em>, as forms or essences which the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> abstracts. This is the conclusion of Moderate Realism.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, more than elsewhere, Alexander shows that he is not prepared to break with the traditional Augustinian teaching which prevailed in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> before the introduction of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> "De Anima". Thus he adopts the threefold division of the faculties of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into <em>ratio</em>, which has for its object the external world, <em>intellectus</em> which has for its object created spiritual substances, and <em>intelligentia</em>, which has for its object first principles and the eternal prototype of things in the mind of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Augustinian, also, is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of higher <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, especially of higher spiritual <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, is dependent on special divine illumination. Despite these Augustinian principles, however, he adopts <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Active and Passive Intellect, and by means of it accounts for our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the external world. Alexander's importance in the history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">Ethics</a> is due to the use which he makes of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> treatises. <a href="../cathen/15631d.htm">William of Auxerre</a>, in his "Summa Aurea", made use of a Latin translation of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> "Ethics"; following his example, though working along independent lines, Alexander takes up the problems of the Highest Good, the nature of virtue, the moral aspect of actions and habits, and brings to bear on his discussions not merely the principles of the evangelical law, the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> definitions of patristic writers, the legislation and practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but also the definitions and principles laid down in the "Ethics". <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he teaches, is the highest Good; man's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to attain possession of Him. He defines virtue, in the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a>, not in the traditional Augustinian sense. Alexander, being the first of the great thirteenth century <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">schoolmen</a> in point of time, naturally exercised considerable influence on all those great leaders who made the thirteenth century the golden age of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. Within his own order he was the model of other great Summists as to method and arrangement of matter. <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> says that Alexander was a favourite teacher (<em>doctor</em>) of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. This, however, need not mean, as it is sometimes taken to mean, that St. Thomas frequented his lecture hall. The influence was exerted chiefly, if not exclusively, through Alexander's "Summa Universae Theologiae," which St. Thomas followed very closely in the arrangement and method of his "Summa Theologica".
