<h1>Alexandre-Etienne Choron</h1>  

<p>A French musician and teacher of music, b. at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>, 21 October, 1772; d. 29 June, 1834. Being denied by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> the permission to study music under proper guidance, he nevertheless endeavoured to master the theories of <a href="../cathen/12637c.htm">J.-P. Rameau</a> and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Later he received instruction in harmony for a short time, from the Abb&eacute; Roze and Bonesi. Through Bonesi, Choron became acquainted with the treatise of Nicol&ograve; Sala (1701-1800) on fugue and <a href="../cathen/04436a.htm">counterpoint</a>, and with Italian music art in general. The result was his work "Principes d'accompagnement des &eacute;coles d' Italie". In order to acquire thoroughly the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of Kirnberger Marpurg, and <a href="../cathen/01270a.htm">Albrechtsberger</a>, he studied the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a>. Thus equipped, Choron entered upon his wonderful career of reform in all branches of musical activity. In 1811, he was entrusted by the Government with the important task of reorganizing the more important church choirs of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and other cities and of directing the musical performances on solemn public and religious occasions. In 1816 Choron became musical director of the Grand Opera, but this engagement lasted only one year, on account of the unpopularity of his endeavours towards reform. He now brought about reopening, under the name of "Ecole royale de Chant et D&eacute;clamation" of the Conservatoire, which held been closed in 1815. In 1817 Choron founded the "Institution royale de Musique classique et religieuse", which was subsidized by the Government and was destined to exert a far-reaching influence through the distinguished musicians it produced and its publication and performance of important choral works, especially those of <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a>, Bach, and Handel. By the withdrawal of the Government subsidy on the death of Charles X, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school's</a> efficiency was crippled. This caused such disappointment to Choron that he did not long survive.

<p>Besides accomplishing all this work, Choron published, in collaboration with Fran&ccedil;ois-Joseph-Marie Fayalle (1774-1852), "Dictionaire historique des musiciens", "M&eacute;thode &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire de musique et de plain chant", a revised and enlarged edition of Francoeurs' "Trait&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des voix et des instruments d'orchestre", translations of theoretical works by <a href="../cathen/01270a.htm">Albrechtsberger</a> and Azopardi, "M&eacute;thode concertante &agrave; plusieurs voix" (which treatise formed the basis of institution in Choron's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>), "M&eacute;thode de plain chant", "Manuel complet de musique vocale et instrumentale", and an "Encyclop&eacute;die musicale" in eight volumes. Choron's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was afterward revived, as the "Ecole Niedermeyer", by Louis Niedermeyer (1802-61), who, by means of a small Government subsidy, succeeded in keeping alive Choron's principles and tradition.

<p>Choron's principal service to musical art in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> consists in having trained and purified French taste. Through him and men like Louis Niedermeyer and Joseph d' Ortigue there gradually developed among musicians that appreciation of the essential difference between <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">sacred music</a> and profane music &#151; between music of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and music of the theatre &#151; which finally culminated in the foundation of the now flourishing "Schola Cantorum" and the famous association "Les Chanteurs de Saint-Gervais". Both institutions were founded by Charles Bordes and became the principal agencies in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for the realization of the aims of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> in regard to the reform of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>.
