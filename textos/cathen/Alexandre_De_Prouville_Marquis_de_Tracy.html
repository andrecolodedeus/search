<h1>Alexandre De Prouville, Marquis de Tracy</h1>  

<p>Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>, born in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1603, of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; died there in 1670. A soldier from his youth, he had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his valour in many battles and won the rank of lieutenant-general of the king's armies. He was no less prudent and wise as a negotiator and organizer. Entrusted by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> with a most extensive mission and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all the French possessions in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, he first redeemed Cayenne from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, restored order to the Antilles, and reached Quebec in 1665. He had been preceded by the Carignan regiment which had distinguished itself against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (1664) and was entitled to bear the royal colours. With the concurrence of Courcelles, the newly-appointed governor, and Talon, the famous intendant, he inaugurated a glorious period in the history of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>. To secure peace for the colony <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was decided against the Agniers, and in spite of his advanced age, Tracy commanded the invading army. The year previous he had ordered the construction of three forts on the Richelieu River, including those of Sorel and Chambly. The enemies had fled from their villages, which were destroyed, and Tracy returned with nearly all his men. The humiliated Agniers sued for peace and asked for missionaries to instruct them in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Tracy with his two associates then devoted himself to the organization of the courts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and to the promotion of agriculture and industry. During his administration were imported the first horses seen in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Tracy's noble and conciliatory conduct endeared him to the colonists and won the respect both of the aborigines and of the authorities of New York. His administration was marked by two chief events full of promise for the prosperity of the colony: the abolition of the monopoly of the West <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> company, which had replaced that of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>, and the conclusion of a peace with the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> which lasted eighteen years and facilitated several brilliant discoveries in the interior of the continent.
