<h1>Alexandre Guy Pingr&eacute;</h1>  

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 11 September, 1711; died 1 May, 1796. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in Senlis at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the Genovefan fathers, Regulars of the Order of St. Augustine, which he entered at sixteen. In 1735 he was made professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> there. About 1749 he accepted the professorship of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> in the newly-founded academy at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. Already famous for detecting an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of four minutes in Lacaille's calculation of the lunar eclipse of 23 December, 1749, in 1753 he further distinguished himself by the observation of the transit of Mercury and was consequently appointed corresponding member of the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences. Later he was made librarian of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve and chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. He built an observatory in the Abbey of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve and there spent forty years of strenuous labour. He compiled in 1753 the first nautical almanac for the year 1754, and subsequently for 1755-57, when Lalande was charged with the publication. Lacaille had calculated for his treatise, "L'art de v&eacute;rifier les dates", the eclipses of the first nineteen centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era; Pingr&eacute; in a second edition took up his calculations and extended them over ten centuries before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In 1760 he joined an unsuccessful expedition to the Island Rodriguez in the Pacific to observe the transit of Venus on 6 June, 1761. More satisfactory results were obtained from an expedition to the French Cape on Haiti where the next transit was observed on 3 June, 1769. About 1757 he became engrossed in the history of comets, and in his "Com&eacute;tographie ou Trait&eacute; historique et th&eacute;orique des com&egrave;tes" (2 vols., Paris, 1783-4), the material contained in all the ancient annals and more recent publications is methodically arranged and critically sifted. In 1756 he published a "Projet d'une histoire d'astronomie du dix-septi&egrave;me si&egrave;cle", completed in 1786. Through Lalande's influence the National Assembly granted three thousand francs to defray the expenses of publication, but it proceeded slowly and at Ping&eacute;'s death was discontinued. In 1901 the whole work was re-edited by Bigourdan under the title: "Annales c&eacute;lestes du dix-septi&egrave;me si&egrave;cle". Pingr&eacute; also published "Manuale Astronomicon libri quinque et Arati Ph&aelig;nomena, cum interpretatione Gallica et notis" (2 vols., 1786), and numerous <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observations in the "M&eacute;moires de l'Institut" (1753-87), in the "Journal de Tr&eacute;voux", in the "Phil. Trans." etc.

<p>In encyclopedic works it is commonly asserted that Pingr&eacute; took an active part in <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> quarrels, and hence was relegated to provincial towns and colleges. Consequently he is often said to have fallen a victim to Roman intolerance. The fact is that during his earlier career Pingr&eacute; seems to have been imbued with <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> views, as is borne out by the "Nouvelles Eccl&eacute;siastiques", the great <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> organ. In 1737 Mgr de Salignac, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">Pamiers</a>, active against <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, summoned Pingr&eacute;, who was severely rebuked and finally had to submit to an examen by some <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a>. He expressed himself willing to condemn the five propositions, <em>de c&aelig;ur et d'esprit</em>, at the same time maintaining that he could not condemn them as propositions of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, as they were not to be found in his works. (It should be remembered that in 1653 and 1656 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had declared repeatedly that the propositions were <em>de facto</em> contained in the "Augustinus".) In 1745 a general chapter of the fathers of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve was convened; by order of the king Father Chambroy was elected superior general. Strict orders had been issued to the superiors of the conventual establishments that only such members should be deputed as were willing to subscribe to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> and especially <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>. This measure excited opposition. Father Pingr&eacute;, then living at Senlis, and some of his fellow religious entered a vehement protest against the proceedings of the chapter. Father Scoffier, one of the most determined opponents of the election, was removed from Senlis. A similar disciplinary punishment was inflicted on Pingr&eacute;, then professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. According to an introductory notice prefaced to the memoirs of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> Abb&eacute; Arnauld d'Andilly, in the collection "M&eacute;moires sur l'histoire de France de Michaud et Poujoulat" (2nd series, IX), Pingr&eacute; is their editor (Leyden, 1756). He was therefore an active <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>, at least until 1747; his influence, however, never became serious nor lasting. In the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of the eighteenth century, especially in the "M&eacute;moires pour servir &agrave; l'histoire eccl&eacute;siatique pendant le 18e si&egrave;cle" of Picot, his name is not mentioned.
