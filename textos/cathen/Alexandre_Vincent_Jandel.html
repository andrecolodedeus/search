<h1>Alexandre Vincent Jandel</h1>  

<p>General of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican order</a>, born at Gerbevilliers (Lorraine), 18 July, 1810; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 11 December, 1872. He was remarkable from his earliest years for intelligence and resolution, qualities derived chiefly from his mother, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of rare endowments, who did not fear to succour <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. After a brilliant collegiate course at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in that city, where his success was equally great. Jandel was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 20 September, 1834, then appointed professor of Scripture, and soon afterwards <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson. The young superior was regarded as a model of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning. At this time he became acquainted with <a href="../cathen/02353a.htm">Bautain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06470b.htm">Gerbet</a>, <a href="../cathen/12659b.htm">Ratisbonne</a>, and many other distinguished men, among them <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>. Such was the impression made on him by <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, that he began to think of entering the Domninican Order, which the great preacher proposed to restore in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where it had been destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. In 1839 he therefore went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, consulted <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> on the matter, and finally received the habit on 15 May, 1841. Two years afterwards Jandel and <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> commenced the great work of re-establishing their order in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> was an orator; Jandel was a ruler of men, calm, grave, sagacious, tenacious of traditions and customs, and pre-eminently practical. Though he had not the genius of his associate, he preached with great results. A sermon at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> on the power of the Cross led to his being challenged by a <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemason</a> to prove the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his words in the lodge; he entered it, produced his crucifix, and made the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>; instantly the lights were extinguished, the furniture was thrown about, and all but he fled in terror from the scene of confusion.

<p>Many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> placed themselves under his guidance. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, however, called him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and made him in 1850 <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the order <em>ad beneplacitum,</em> and in 1855 general for six years. He was soon recognized as the greatest religious superior and one of the most enlightened spiritual directors in the city. Of those whom he instructed at this time, two may be mentioned: <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> and Father Burke. A born administrator, he infused new life into the order. Several provinces were re-established, and houses opened everywhere. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (second order) and tertiaries were also greatly indebted to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. He also did much to promote devotion to the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a> and to propagate the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. Such were the services he rendered to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> especially as regarded the Zouaves, that <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who was warmly attached to him, intended to make him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; but Providence disposed otherwise, for he was elected general of the order, 7 June, 1862. He visited <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> twice, and only weak health prevented him from visiting America. New editions of <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> and of the "constitutions" or legislation formed part of his characteristic work. He also paid great attention to foreign missions. During his term of office sixteen <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> or <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. He presided at two chapters of the order (Ghent, 1971), and he is justly considered as one of the greatest generals that the order has had during the seven centuries of its existence.
