<h1>Alexians</h1>  

<p><em>Or</em> CELLITES.

<p>A religious institute or congregation, which had its origin at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, in Brabant, in the fifteenth century, during the terrible ravages of a pest called the "black death." Certain <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> united under the guidance of a man named Tobias to succour the plague-stricken, without taking any <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> or adopting a rule of life. One of their most obvious actions being the burial of those who died from the plague; they were known as "Cellites" (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>cella</em>, a cell and hence, a grave). Later on, they chose as their patron, Alexius, a saint who served many years in a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>; and thenceforth they called themselves the Alexian Brothers. They spread rapidly through <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Brabant, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and other countries. As they were also styled <em>Lollhorden</em> (Old Germ. <em>lollon</em>, to sing softly) from their chants for the dead, they have consequently been sometimes confounded with the <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclifian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09333a.htm">Lollards</a>. They did not escape <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, as appears from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ad Audientiam Nostram" (2 Dec., 1377) which <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> sent to the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, especially those of Cologne, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, forbidding annoyance of the Cellites and enjoining punishment for their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>. This was followed by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of a similar tenor from <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> (7 Jan., 1396), <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> (12 May, 1431), <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>. In 1469, the mother-house at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aix-la-Chapelle</a> voiced the general feeling of the Brothers in asking the Prince <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, Louis de Bourbon, to raise that house to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Order of St. Augustine. This request was granted, and Father Dominicus Brock and five of the Brothers took the solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religious. This step and the revised constitution of the Order were confirmed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (12 Sept., 1870).

<p>The Alexian Brothers have four <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The first was built in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, 1866; destroyed by the great fire, 9 Oct. 1871, and rebuilt the following year. The second, erected at St. Louis in 1869, covers an acre with its departments for the insane, nervous diseases, and inebriates. The third is at Oshkosh, Wis. (1880). The fourth was built at Elizabeth, N.J., on land given for that purpose by Right Rev. Bishop Wigger. Competent surgeons and physicians attend to the patients, and the Brothers are nurses and do the housework of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Bishop Vaughan</a> of <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (later, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>), invited the Alexian Brothers to take charge of a new home and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which led to their establishing themselves in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in June, 1875. Dr. Lacy, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Middlesborough, secured them for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1884. In 1885, the Brothers established a Province of their Order and a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in the United Kingdom. The latter, first attached to St. Mary's Convent, Newton Heath, <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, was later transferred to Twyford Abbey, near Ealing, which the Alexian Brothers had purchased. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> they do not have any asylums for the care of the insane, as in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and America. The English establishments are only for the aged and infirm.
