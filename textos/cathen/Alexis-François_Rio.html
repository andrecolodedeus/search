<h1>Alexis-Fran&ccedil;ois Rio</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> writer on art, b. on the Island of Arz, Department of Morbihan, 20 May, 1797; d. 17 June, 1874. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, where he received his first appointment as instructor, which occupation however proved to be distasteful. He proceeded to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but was temporarily disappointed in his hope of obtaining there a chair of history. His enthusiastic championship of the liberty of the Greeks attracted the attention of the Government, which appointed him censor of the public press. His refusal of this appointment won him great popularity and the lifelong friendship of <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>. In 1828 he published his first work, "Essai sur l'histoire de l'esprit humain dans l'antiquit&eacute;", which brought him the favour of the minister de La Ferronays and a secretariate in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This position allowed him (as <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> later wrote to him) to become for <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian</a>, what <a href="../cathen/15650a.htm">Winckelmann</a> had been for ancient, art. He spent the greater portion of the period 1830-60 in travels through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> he became acquainted with the spokesmen of contemporary <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> &#151; Boisser&eacute;e, Baader, <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, G&ouml;rres, and <a href="../cathen/13228a.htm">Rumohr</a> &#151; and also with Schelling. Schelling gave him an insight into the &aelig;sthetic ideal; <a href="../cathen/13228a.htm">Rumohr</a> directed him to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where the realization of this ideal in art could be seen. In 1835 the first volume of his "Art chr&eacute;tien" appeared under the misleading title, "De la po&eacute;sie chr&eacute;tienne--Forme de l'art". This work, which was received with enthusiasm in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was a complete failure in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Discouraged, he renounced art study and wrote a history of the persecutions of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, a work which was never printed. As the result of his intercourse with the Pre-Raphaelites of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he lived for three years and married, and especially of <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert's</a> encouragement, he visited again, in company with his wife, all the important galleries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, although he had meanwhile become lame and had to drag himself through the museums on crutches. Prominent men like Gladstone, <a href="../cathen/09634a.htm">Manzoni</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14635b.htm">Thiers</a> became interested in his studies, which he published in four volumes under the title "L'art chr&eacute;tien" (1861-7). This work is not a history of all <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> from <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> to the death of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>. Without any strict method or criticism, he expresses preference for the art of the fifteenth century, not without many an inexact and even <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgment on the art of later ages; but, in spite, or rather on account of this partiality, he has contributed greatly towards restoring to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the forgotten and despised art of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Rio describes the more notable incidents of his life in the two works, "Histoire d'un coll&egrave;ge breton sous l'Empire, la petite chouannerie" (1842) and "Epilogue &agrave; l'art chr&eacute;tien" (2 vols., Paris, 1872). He also published the following works: "Shakespeare" (1864), in which he claims the <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">great dramatist</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; "Michel-Ange et Raphael" (1867); "L'id&eacute;al antique et l'id&eacute;al chr&eacute;tien" (1873).
