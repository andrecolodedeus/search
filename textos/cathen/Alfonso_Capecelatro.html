<h1>Alfonso Capecelatro</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer; b. at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, 5 Feb., 1824; d. 14 Nov., 1912. He was descended from the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the dukes of Castel Pagano. His father served with distinction under Murat, adopted the political principles of the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> period, and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> exiled himself to Malta and <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, when Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, after his restoration by the Congress of <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Laibach</a>, set about the repression of political <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1826 and to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> in 1830. At sixteen Alfonso entered the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratory of St. Philip Neri</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1847, he zealously devoted himself to the confessional, preaching, and various charitable enterprises, without, however, neglecting his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies, and giving especial attention to <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. He was more particularly drawn to <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>, <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>, <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a>, the great figures who at various times represented religious revival in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and whose biographies he wrote. He refuted Renan's "Life of Christ" then widely circulated in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and afterwards himself published a "Life of Jesus Christ", wherein without entering into details of criticism and polemics, he gathered the results of modern researches on the topography and the contemporary history, customs, usages, and opinions of the Hebrews. He devoted three volumes to an exposition of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and two to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">Christian virtues</a>, and published several volumes of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>.

<p>Meanwhile he maintained personal relations with various <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, particularly <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, among them the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Ludovico da Casovia, whose biography he wrote, and two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> Persico and Casanova, with whom he often discussed methods of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction. He corresponded with other Liberal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, among them <a href="../cathen/09634a.htm">Manzoni</a>, Cesare Cant&ugrave;, <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Dupanloup</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>. These friendships indicated that he was tending towards "Catholic <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>". His own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> antecedents better explained both this and Capecelatro's "conciliatorist" tendencies after 1870. These tendencies were not unknown to <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, who, one year after his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, summoned the learned Oratorian to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, together with <a href="../cathen/14788c.htm">Padre Luigi Tosti</a>, and made him assistant librarian, wishing thereby not only to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> a learned man, but also to make use of him for the work of reconciliation which occupied his mind until 1887. In 1880 Capecelatro was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>. There he passed his life in the administration of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, literary labours, and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. He was made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1885. In the pastoral letters and other minor works published in the last years of his life he treats the great questions of modern times, especially those relating to public life in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His writings are distinguished by purity and simplicity of style. He received some votes in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1903. He had no influence in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> politics; but his correspondence will unquestionably supply valuable material for the politico-religious history of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in his time. Cardinal Capecelatro, particularly in recent years, was overwhelmed by the course of events and by that <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernist</a> crisis which had long been preparing and so <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> burst out in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He remained immured in his old ideal of "God and Liberty", in the old dream of "the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> arm-in-arm with the King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>". He did not understand the new movement and the hard lessons which it brought with it. But that did not prevent <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> from calling him with reason, on the occasion of his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> jubilee, "a learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, an elegant and prolific writer, a scrupulous <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiographer</a>, and, as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a tender and compassionate father".
