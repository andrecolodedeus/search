<h1>Alfonso de Vald&eacute;s</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanist</a> and chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, born at Cuenca in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a> about 1500; died at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in October, 1532. His talents gave him early advancement and he accompanied <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> in 1520 on the journey from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, and in 1521 to the Diet of Worms. From 1522 he was a secretary of the imperial chancellery and as secretary wrote a number of important state papers: in 1525, he drew up the report of the battle of Pavia; in 1526 the energetic, graphic, and at times deliberately sarcastic state paper addressed to <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Pope Clement VII</a>, in which the faithlessness of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is stigmatized, and an appeal is made for the convoking of an Ecumenical Council. After the capture and pillage of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1527, Vald&eacute;s wrote the dialogue "Lactantius" in which he <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> attacked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as a disturber of the public peace, an instigator of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and a perfidious deceiver, declared the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and called the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> the worst governed dominion in the world. The dialogue was printed in 1529 and was widely read. The <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/03409c.htm">Baldassare Castiglione</a>, brought an accusation before the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, but the trial amounted to nothing because <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> took his servant under his protection, while the grand inquisitor also declared that it was not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> to speak against the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Consequently it was decided that the dialogue was not <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a>. Vald&eacute;s was full of enthusiasm for the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> of Rotterdam and sought to gain currency for them in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In 1529 he accompanied the emperor to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. At the Diet held at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in 1530 he was an influential negotiator with <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and met them in a pacific and conciliatory spirit; yet it cannot be said that he shared their views or showed that he understood <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> motives; his point of view was solely that of a statesman. In October, 1531, he wrote from <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> the letter of congratulation to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> after the victory over <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>. He was the brother of Juan Vald&eacute;s, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> movement in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, many of whose followers became <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>.
