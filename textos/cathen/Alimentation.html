<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Alimentation</h1>  

<p>Support or maintenance. <em>Aliment</em> in a broad sense means whatever is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to sustain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>: not merely food and drink, but lodging, clothing, care during sickness and burial. A parent is bound to supply such aliment to his child, and this whether it is of legitimate or <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> birth; and, if the latter, whether it is the fruit of simple unlawful cohabitation, or of an adulterous, incest, or sacrilegious one. This is a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> imposed by the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, personal and real, since it not only binds the father himself but is a claim upon his estate. The husband owes aliment to his wife, and children owe it to their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>, and to other relatives who are in want. The <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">Common Law</a> of civilized countries determines all these <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> the professed is incorporated into his order, and has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to aliment from it; becoming a son, so to speak, of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, he acquires the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the son of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> house. He retains this right even if he is shut up in another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to do penance there, or if he is expelled <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> from his order; he is entitled to it while on trial for some charge, though this may result in his expulsion; but his sentence once pronounced and accepted, he can claim nothing from his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>.

<p>Clerics must be assured of something that will support them, since they cannot be promoted to major orders if they have no title guaranteeing them an honourable subsistence. As a matter of fact it has always been repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that one who exercises the holy ministry should have to beg his bread or practise some undignified calling. Formerly, no one was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> even to <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> who had not some <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> charge in a church which provided him with a suitable maintenance; the church for which he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> was called the "Tide of Ordination", and he himself was said to be "titled" (<em>Intitulatus</em>). Later, after it had become the custom not only to give the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, but also minor and major orders, without a title, <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/09017b.htm">Third Lateran Council</a>, condemned <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who should ordain <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> without a title, to support such <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from the episcopal table if they came to want. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> extended this <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> to <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, and it is since this that the "title of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>" is exacted only for the major orders. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, Sess. XXI, ch. 2, "De ref.", maintained the necessity for the "title of ordination", and recognized three: a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, a patrimony, and a fixed income. Title in general is something that assures support for life to a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> promoted to major orders. Even religious must receive some such assurance when they are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. Religious of solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> under the "Title of Poverty", or of "Religious Profession", and this assures them permanent support from the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Religious of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are ordinarily <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, by virtue of <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">Apostolic indults</a>, under the "Title of the Common Table", which assures them due support from the goods of the congregation to which they belong. Should they, through an <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> of secularization, be permitted to withdraw from their religious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, they may not do so until they have been accepted by some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and are provided with a title that offers them a respectable living.

<p>Secular <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> will be secured against need when they are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, by the title of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, patrimony, or stable income. By the title of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> the cleric promoted to major orders is provided with a perpetual <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office, the revenue from which suffices for his proper support. By the title of patrimony, the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> clerk, having personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> gives a guarantee to his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that, in case he should not be provided with an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a>, he can support himself fitly for life out of his own fortune. By the title of pension, or stable provision, some one pledges himself to provide for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, should he fall into indigence. These three titles do not avail in missionary countries, either because there are no <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> in such regions, or that personal fortunes are rare, or that there are few willing to bind themselves to supply permanent support for a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>. This is why the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>, in a celebrated instruction sent to countries dependent on it, permits <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to ordain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> under "title of the mission". By this title, the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> before receiving the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeaconship</a>, promises under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, that, once <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, he will not enter any <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order or congregation, without permission of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, and that he will live in the diocese under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, employing himself in the service of the mission. The clerk so <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> is a charge on the diocese for which he has been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, which assures him a respectable support if through infirmity or incapacity he chance to fall into poverty. It should be remarked here that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> under the title of the mission has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to his support, even when, through his own fault, he has become unworthy of filling an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> position. The <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> in a response to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, 4 February, 1873, shows clearly that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot be deprived of his means of support, unless, after repeated warnings, he refuses to amend, and falls into <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a>. Grave offences committed by him such as may even justify his deposition from office, will not warrant the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in refusing him means of support. He will, of course, have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the pension from the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> from which he has been deposed, but should he wish to amend, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, like a compassionate mother, instead of turning him into the street will supply him with his daily tread, and will endeavour to bring him to a realization of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> courses and consequent penance.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of providing for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> under "title of the mission" creates a somewhat heavy burden for <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In these countries, especially the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been forced to devise some way of satisfying this demand of their pastoral charge. In virtue of a special power of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>, they can grant to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or missionary who resigns his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> or mission, on account of infirmity, a pension drawn from the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> or mission, to be paid by his successor in it. For a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to have a claim to such pension, <ul><li>he must have resigned because of infirmity; <li>he must have been ten years in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> or mission; and <li>the pension must not exceed a third of the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> or mission.</ul>

<p>Moreover, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have encouraged among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the foundation of "Clerical Funds", whose purpose is to afford pecuniary assistance during their life to members who become infirm and consequently incapable of fulfilling an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> charge. Priests in good health belonging to the diocese enter into these <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and the members contribute something every year to the "Clerical Fund". The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is administered by a bureau of which it is customary for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be the president, while the directors are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> chosen by members of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The amount disbursed to needy members depends on the contributions received and varies with different places. As fallen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who have repented cannot be abandoned, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> provide for them either by founding houses of retreat in which they can do penance, or by sending them to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, where, under the watchful care of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religious they may, by reflecting on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of their state, cause the grace of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to revive.
