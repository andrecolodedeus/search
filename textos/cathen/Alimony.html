<h1>Alimony</h1>  

<p>(Latin, <em>alimonia</em>, nutriment, from <em>alere</em>, to nourish)

<p>In the common legal sense of the word, alimony is the allowance which by order of the court a husband pays to his wife for her maintenance while she is living separately from him, or the allowance or provision ordered by the court to be paid by her former husband to a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. There are two kinds of alimony, the one kind, alimony <em>pendente lite</em>, being an allowance to the wife pending a suit between herself and her husband, and the other the allowance or provision after suit, and which is known as permanent alimony. Exclusive <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of matrimonial causes was in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> formerly vested in <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>. These courts, notwithstanding the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of a wife became on marriage the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of her husband, assigned to a wife who was compelled to live apart from her husband a portion of his income for her maintenance or alimony. Regulating their action by the canon law, these courts confined themselves to two general classes of matrimonial cases: suits for separation (divorce <em>a mens&acirc; et toro</em>), and suits to have a marriage declared void from the beginning. Alimony <em>pendente lite</em> might be allowed in a suit belonging to either class, but permanent alimony in a suit for separation only. For, being incidental to marriage, alimony was not allowed in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> declaring a marriage to have been void from the beginning. Non-payment by the husband subjected him to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, a judgment of the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> which the executive department of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil government</a> enforced through its officer, the sheriff, to whom was issued the writ <em>de excommunicato capiendo</em>, reciting that "potestas regia sacrosanct&aelig; ecclesi&aelig; in querelis suis de esse non debet" (Registrum omnium brevium, 65). And so it is said that under the appellation of <em>estovers</em>, collection of alimony was enforced through writ <em>de estoveriis habendis</em>. In 1857, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in matrimonial cases was taken by statute from the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>, and the court of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> and matrimonial causes, with power to grant absolute <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, was established. In none of the states of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> have matrimonial cases been confided to <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>. The courts in the several states having <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to award alimony in matrimonial cases and the circumstances under which it may be awarded are to be ascertained from the constitution, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, and the decisions of the courts of each state. By the ancient <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> there was allowed on behalf of a pupil against an unfaithful tutor or curator a proceeding in which the pupil might obtain what has been termed alimony. In this proceeding it became the pr&aelig;tor's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to fix the character and amount of the pupil's expenses, "<em>decernere alimenta</em>", "and if", remarks Cumin ("A Manual of Civil Law", 2d ed., London, 1865, 79), "the tutor appeared and falsely alleged that the pupil's means would not allow alimony to be decreed, he would be removed as <em>suspectus</em> and delivered to the <em>Pr&oelig;fectus urbis</em> for punishment." The Civil Code of the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">State of Louisiana</a> contains a very broad definition of alimony as a claim for support. The term has been used in <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English literature</a> in the general sense of nourishment. Thus, Jeremy Taylor refers to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> being considered "spiritual alimony." See "A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles," by J. A. H. Murray, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, New York, 1888, s.v. "Alimony."
