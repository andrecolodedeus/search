<h1>Aliturgical Days</h1>  

<p>This term, though not recognized by any English dictionary has lately come into use as a convenience designation for those days on which the "liturgy", i.e. the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Eucharist</a>, is not allowed to be celebrated. The term is warranted by modern Greek example (<em>aleitourgetikos, liturgia carens dies</em> &#151; <a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, "Calendarium", II, 743 &#151; though <em>aleitourgesia</em> under the Empire commonly meant exemption from public burdens), and the conception is much more familiar among the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> than in the West. In the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, in fact, there is only one day in the year which is generally recognized as aliturgical. This is <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, on which, as is well known, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> it not offered; since the so-called "Mass of the Presanctified" which takes its place contains no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and the sacred Host which is consumed by the celebrant is one that has been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on the preceding day. Strictly speaking, the <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> is also an aliturgic day in the West; for it is easy to show that the Mass which is now celebrated in the morning, after the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candle</a> and the font, belongs of right to the office of <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a>, and that in the early ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> it was only celebrated after midnight at the close of the great <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter-vigil</a>. In the Ambrosian Rite, still retained in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, all the Fridays of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> are also theoretically aliturgical, and no Mass is celebrated on those days in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches (see the sketch of Ambrosian practices in Magani, "L'Antica Liturgia Romana", <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1897, I). But the prohibition is evaded by many of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who on these days say their Mass in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and other privileged <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> where the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> is followed. In the Russian <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> at the present day the whole of the seven weeks preceding <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> are aliturgical, except the Saturday and Sunday of each week. Amongst these aliturgical days, however, certain differences are made, for on some of them the "service of the presanctified" (<em>akolouthia ton proegiasmenon</em>) is celebrated in the evening. These days are the Wednesday and the Friday of the first six weeks of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, a very few minor festivals, and the first three days of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">feast of the Annunciation</a>, whenever it falls, is a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> day but if it chances to coincide with <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> the feast is transferred to <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Week</a>.

<p>Although we do not possess much which can be regarded as direct and clear evidence, there is every reason to believe that in early centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> aliturgical days were numerous both in East and West. In the beginning of things Mass seems to have been said only on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and on the very few festivals then recognized, or perhaps on the anniversaries of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself officiating. To these occasions we have to add certain days of "stations" which seem to have coincided with the Wednesday and Friday fast then kept regularly throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But there is considerable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the liturgy was always celebrated on these days of stations, and we have indications in <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and other writers of a current of opinion which tended to regard the offering of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> as inconsistent with the observance of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and serious fast. In Alexandria in the fifth century we have direct testimony of the observances on certain fast days of all the rites which belonged to the usual assembly of the faithful (synaxis), "with the exception of the celebration of the mysteries". This probably points to some kind of Mass of the Presanctified. A letter of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a> (401-417) to Decentius of Eugubium makes it clear that no Mass was said in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, and some writers have wished to draw the conclusion that the same was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of all Fridays and Saturdays throughout the year. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> Canon xxvi of the Council of Elvira (300) may be quoted as evidence that the faithful at that time <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> every Thursday evening to the Sunday morning, and that the liturgy was probably celebrated during the vigil of the Saturday night as the fast drew to its close. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this practice followed the type of the <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> vigil. In the later centuries we can only be sure of certain isolated facts which argue considerable diversity of usage. Dom Germain Morin has shown that at <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, in the sixth century, and also in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> only on the Wednesday and the Friday. It is probable that a similar rule, but including the Monday also, obtained in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the days of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> or even later (see "Revue Benedictine", 1891, VIII, 529). At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> we also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that down to the time of <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Pope Gregory II</a> (715-731), the liturgy was not celebrated on Thursdays. In the East, Canon xlix of the Council of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> (365?), laid it down "that it is not lawful to offer bread in Lent except on the Saturday and the Lord's day", while the Council of Constantinople (in Trullo), in 692, speaks explicity of the liturgy of the presanctified and appoints it to be celebrated on all days of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, except the Saturday, the Sunday, and the <a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">feast of the Annunciation</a>.
