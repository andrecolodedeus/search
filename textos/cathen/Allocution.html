<h1>Allocution</h1>  

<p>Allocution is a solemn form of address or speech from the throne employed by the Pope on certain occasions. It is delivered only in a secret consistory at which the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> alone are present. The term <em>allocutio</em> was used by the ancient Romans for the speech made by a commander to his troops, either before a battle or during it, to animate and encourage them. The term when adopted into <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> usage retained much of its original significance. An allocution of the Pope often takes the place of a manifesto when a struggle between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular powers</a> has reached an acute stage. It then usually summarizes the points at issue and details the efforts made by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to preserve peace. It likewise indicates what the Pope has already conceded and the limit which principle obliges him to put to further concessions. A secret consistory of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, as opposed to a public and ceremonious one, is a meeting of those dignitaries in presence of the Pope to discuss matters of great importance concerning the well-being of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. At these secret consistories the Sovereign Pontiff not only creates <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, but he also discusses with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> grave matters of State arising out of those mixed affairs, partly religious, partly civil, in which conflict can easily arise between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. In such secret consistories the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> have a consultative vote. When the Pope has reached a conclusion on some important matter, he makes his mind known to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> by means of a direct address, or allocution. Such allocations, though delivered in secret, are usually published for the purpose of making clear the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> on a given question. They treat generally of matters that affect the whole Church, or of religious troubles in a particular country where <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> are infringed or endangered, or where <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> or immoral doctrines are undermining the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the people. Most of the subjects presented to the secret consistory have already been prepared in the consistorial congregation, which is composed of a limited number of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. These conclusions may be accepted or rejected by the Pope as he thinks proper. In matters of statecraft the Pontiff also takes counsel with those most conversant with the subject at issue and with his Secretary of State. His conclusions are embodied in the allocution. Among <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> allocation of later times which attracted widespread attention from the importance or delicacy of the matters with which they dealt, may be mentioned those of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> on the French Concordat (1802) and on the difficulties created by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (1808); those of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> referring to the troubles with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, and with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> over forcible conversions to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>; those of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> concerning the attacks on the Pope's temporal power, and of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> on the rupture with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> occasioned by the breaking of the Concordat and the consequent separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in that country.
