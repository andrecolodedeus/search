<h1>Alogi</h1>  

<p>(<em>a</em> privative and <em>logos</em>, "word"; sc. "Deniers of the Word"). St. Iren&aelig;us (Adv. Haer., III, ii, 9) makes a brief reference to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who denied the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>, and refused, in consequence, to admit the Gospel of St. John, wherein it is announced. He gives the party no name. <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a> combated such an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> both in his Syntagma and in a special work entitled "In Defence of the Gospel of John and the Apocalypse." These works are lost, but a good share of their contents is believed to have been preserved by <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (Haer. LI) gives a long account of the party of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who arose after the Cataphrygians, Quartodecimans, and others, and who received neither the Gospel of St. John nor his Apocalypse. He calls them Alogi (deniers of the Word) because, by rejecting the Gospel of St. John, they rejected the <em>Logos</em> which was revealed in that Gospel. Playing on the term, he observes, with a touch of sarcasm, that they are well named, "alogi," i.e. "without reason." These <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> would seem to answer to the description of the obscure <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> mentioned by St. Iren&aelig;us, and this is in fact the prevalent opinion about them. The Alogi, accordingly, may be described as a party which arose in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> towards the end of the second century. They doubtless embodied a radical protest against the abuse which the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> made of the promised <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete's</a> outpourings in visions and prophecies. This would explain why they were led to deny the Gospel of St. John, which foretold the coming of the Holy Spirit, and why again they refused all credit to the Apocalypse, which, with its description of the Heavenly <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and of the reign of a thousand years, fed the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of the enthusiasts of Phrygia. The Alogi attributed these two books to <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>. It is not altogether clear that they denied, in addition, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> of the Son and His eternal generation. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> does, indeed, say that they rejected the <em>Logos</em> preached by St. John, but he is evidently perplexed by their stupidity in attributing to <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> a Gospel which was written against him. For <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> taught that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was mere man, whereas John, in this very book, preaches His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a>. It may, therefore, well be that the Alogi did not reject the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> itself but only the Logos form under which the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was presented in the Gospel. And <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> seems to imply as much, "for," he says, "they themselves seem to believe as we do." Be this as it may, the interest of scholars attaches not so much to their <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">christology</a> as to the biblical criticism they developed. It was, doubtless, a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> prepossession which impelled them to reject the Gospel of St. John and the Apocalypse. But they endeavoured to maintain their contention by arguments drawn from an examination of the books themselves. The Gospel of St. John contained, they said, what was <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>; according to them it was not in accord with the other Gospels, mixed up the synoptic order of events, and was, moreover, docetic in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. They made still less account of the Apocalypse, which, they claimed, was often unintelligible, not to say puerile and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. Apropos of Apoc. ii, 18, they asserted that there was no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church in Thyatira at the time. This anti-Catholic movement has been closely studied, since the Johannine question was broached in the last century, for further light on the position and authority of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> in the early church.
