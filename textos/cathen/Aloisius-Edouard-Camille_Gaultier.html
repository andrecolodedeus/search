<h1>Aloisius-Edouard-Camille Gaultier</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> and schoolmaster; b. at <a href="../cathen/02018b.htm">Asti</a>, <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, about 1745, of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 18 Sept., 1818; began his studies in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and completed them in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>; upon his return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1780) he devoted himself to the work of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and in 1786 opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, wherein he applied his principle of instructing children while amusing them. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to seek refuge in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and, finding in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> a number of his former pupils of the French nobility, he opened a course for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of French refugees. His principles were greatly admired and his methods commended by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">Universities</a> of Oxford and <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>. He came back to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1801, and continued to teach and publish his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> works. Later another journey to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> was undertaken for the purpose of studying the monitorial system of teaching, practised by Bell and Lancaster, a system which he wanted to introduce into the French <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. During the Hundred Days, Carnot appointed him a member of the commission for the reorganization of public instruction, and later Gaultier was one of the founders of the "Soci&eacute;t&eacute; pour l'enseignement &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire".

<p>To give a complete list of Gaultier's works is impossible here. They include text-books for every branch of primary instruction, reading, writing, arithmetic, geometry, geography, history, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and grammatical <a href="../cathen/01450a.htm">analysis</a>, composition, politeness, etc., and they apply his method of instructive plays, that is, a system of questions and answers in which, according to the correctness or incorrectness of the answers, a scheme of loss and gain in credits constantly stimulates the interest of the pupils. While, from the point of view of modern pedagogy, this method has many obvious defects, especially that of being too mechanical and of insisting too much on mere <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>, it was nevertheless an advance on methods previously used, and it acknowledged, though carrying it to excess, the great importance of the principle of interest in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. It must be supplemented by the application of the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> principles of adaptation, reflection, and assimilation.
