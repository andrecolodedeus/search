<h1>Aloisius Lilius</h1>  

<p>Aloisius Lilius, principal author of the Gregorian Calendar, was a native of Cir&#242; or Zir&#242; in Calabria. His name was originally Aloigi Giglio, from which the Latinized form now used is derived. Montucla (Histoire des Math&eacute;matiques, I, 678) <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> calls him a Veronese, and Delambre (Histoire de l'Astronomie moderne, 1812, I, 5 and 57) calls him Luigi Lilio Giraldi, mixing up Aloigi with Lilius Gregorius Giraldi, the author of a work "De Annis et Mensibus". Of Lilius's life nothing is known beyond the fact that he was professor of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11737a.htm">University of Perugia</a> as early as 1552. In that year he was recommended by Cardinal Marcello Cervini (afterwards <a href="../cathen/09641a.htm">Pope Marcellus II</a>) for an increase of salary as an eminent professor and a man highly esteemed by the entire <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. This date may explain why Lilius did not live to see his calendar introduced thirty years later. The statement in Poggendorff's "Handw&ouml;rterbuch", that Lilius was a physician in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and that he died in 1576, is apparently not supported by recent researches. In that year, 1576, his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> on the reform of the calendar was presented to the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> by his brother Antonius, likewise doctor of arts and medicine. Antonius was probably many years younger, as he survived the reform, and owned the copyright of the new calendar, until, by retarding its introduction, he lost that privilege, and its printing became free. Mention is made of a Mgr Thomas Giglio, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14148b.htm">Sora</a>, as first prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commissions for the reform. If he was a relative of the two brothers, he was not guilty of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> favouritism, as he proved himself an obstruction to Aloigi's plans. Lilius's work cannot be understood without a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what was done before him and in what shape his reform was introduced.
<h2>Gregorian reform of the calendar</h2>
<h3>From the Council of Nic&aelig;a to that of Constance</h3>

<p>The reform of the calendar was from the start connected with <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>, viz. those of Nic&aelig;a (325), of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> (1414-1418), of Basle (1431), the Fifth of the Lateran (1512-1517), and that of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> (1545-1563). The double rule, ascribed to the first council, that the vernal equinox shall remain on 21 March, where it then was, and that <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> shall fall on the Sunday after the first vernal full moon, was not respected by all those that planned reforms, but was strictly adhered to in the Gregorian Calendar. It was well known, at the time of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>, that both the Julian year and the lunar cyclo of Meton were too long; yet a remedy could not be adopted until the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> were more exactly determined. This state of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> lasted throughout the first twelve hundred years of our era, as is testified by the few representatives of that period: <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> (544-595), <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (c. 673-735), and <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> (735-804). Some progress was made during the thirteenth century. In the computus of Magister Chonrad (1200) the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the calendar was again pointed out. A first approximation of its extent was almost simultaneously given by <a href="../cathen/07037a.htm">Robert Grosseteste</a> (Greathead, 1175-1253), Chancellor of Oxford and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln, and by the Scottish <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/08409b.htm">Joannes a Sacrobosco</a> (Holywood or Halifax). According to the former one leap day should be omitted every 300 years; according to the latter 288 Julian years were just one day too long, and 19 Julian years were one and one-third hours shorter than the lunar cycle. While the latter <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is estimated correctly, the other two numbers 300 anbd 288 should be replaced by 128. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon of Ilchester</a> (1214-1294), basing his views on <a href="../cathen/07037a.htm">Grosseteste</a>, recommended to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a series of reforms, the merits of which he did not decide. Campanus (between 1261 and 1264) made to <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> the specific proposition to replace the lunar cycle of 19 years by two others of 30 and 304 years. The most important step in the thirteenth century was made by the appearance, in 1252, of the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> tables of King Alphonsus X of Castile.

<p>The fourteenth century is remarkable for an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> conference held at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court in <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. In 1344 <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> sent invitations to Joannes de Muris, a canon of Mani&#232;res (Canton Bourges), who was held to be no mean <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, and to Firminus de Bellavalle (Beauval), a native of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and others. The result of the conference was a treatise written by the two authors just mentioned: "Epistola super reformatione antiqui Calendarii". It had four parts: the solar year, the lunar year, the Golden Number, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. A third author was the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Joannes de Thermis. Whether he was a member of the same conference or not, certain it is that he was charged by <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> to write his "Tractatus de tempore celebrationis Paschalis". It appeared nine years after the conference (1354) and was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a>, successor to <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>. In the same century other treatises on the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and the reform of the calendar are recorded: one of Magister Gordianus (between 1300 and 1320) and one of a Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Isaac Argyros (1372-3).
<h3>The Councils of Constance and Basle</h3>

<p>The fifteenth century marks an epoch in the reform of the calendar by two scientific authorities, Pierre d'Ailly and Nicolas de Cusa, both <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Pierre d'Ailly (1350-1420), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> and Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, followed the views of <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a>. After advising <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">Pope John XXIII</a> in 1412, he pointed out to the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, in 1417, the great <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the calendar. He suggested different remedies: first, to omit one leap day every 134 years, thereby correcting the solar year; second, to omit one day of the lunar cycle every 304 years; or third, to abandon all cyclical computation and follow <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observation. It must be noticed that the first and third proposition of Cardinal d'Ailly are reiterated in our own days (substituting for 134 the correct number 128). The first and second of d'Ailly's propositions were elaborated and again proposed by Cardinal de Cusa (1401-1446) to the Council of Basle. The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> should be corrected by omitting 7 days in the solar cycle (passing, in 1439, from 24 May to 1 June) and 3 days in the lunar cycle. His "Reparatio Calendarii" furnished much information to subsequent reformers. He was the first to take into account differences of longitude for various meridians. The two councils wisely postponed the reform of the calendar to some future time. The fifteenth century was not to close, however, without considerable progress connected with the names of Zoestius, John of Gmund, George of Purbach, and John of Koenigsberg (Regiomontanus). A treatise on the reform of the calendar by Zoestius appeared after 1437. The first printed almanacs were issued by John of Gmund (d. 1442), dean and chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>. His disciple was Purbach, afterwards professor of mathematics at the same <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and teacher of John M&uuml;ller, called Regiomontanus after his native place in Franken. The latter (1435-1476) continued the work of the chancellor in publishing <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> that served as models for a century to come. The Golden Numbers of the lunar cycle were retained, but the lunations were taken from observation. This combination made the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> more and more manifest. Regiomontanus was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, for the purpose of reforming the calendar, but died shortly after his arrival at the age of forty-one.


<h3>The Councils of the Lateran and of Trent</h3>

<p>The two councils of the sixteenth century were finally to pave the way for the long desired reform. The efforts made at the Lateran Council are described by Marzi. From the twelve or more authors enumerated by him it will suffice to mention the two that exercised a decisive influence: Paul of Middleburg, who started the proceedings, and <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a>, who brought them to a temporary conclusion. The life of the former is described by Baldi in Appendix I to Marzi. Paul born in 1445, died as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06154b.htm">Fossombrone</a> in 1534. He was called from <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a>, became professor of mathematics at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and physician and <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologer</a> to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>. Before the opening of the council in 1512 he asked <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> to attend to the calendar. <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> sent out briefs to Maximilian I, the princes, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, to obtain their opinion on the calendar, and appointed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06154b.htm">Fossombrone</a> as president of the commission for the reform. The treatise which <a href="../cathen/11588b.htm">Paul of Middelburg</a> laid before the council is entitled: "Paulina sive de recta Pasch&aelig; celebratione etc." (Fossombrone, 1513). He was against bringing the equinox back to 21 March, and opposed the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of abandoning the lunar cycle or putting <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> on a fixed Sunday of the year. He proposed, however, a change in the cycle by reducing the seven embolismic months to five. Emperor Maximilian charged the Universities of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, T&uuml;bingen, and <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, to express an opinion. <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> supported the first and third propositions of Cardinal d'Ailly at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, viz. to correct the Julian intercalation by omitting a leap day every 134 years, and to abandon the lunar cycle. T&uuml;bingen was of the same opinion, and agreed with Bishop Paul in leaving the equinox where it was.

<p>Copernicus had been asked by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commission in 1514 to state his views, and his decision was, that the motions of sun and moon were not yet sufficiently known to attempt a reform of the calendar. The commission was to make definite propositions in the tenth session of the council. Although this was postponed from 1514 to 1515, no conclusion was reached. After the Lateran Council considerable progress was made. <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a> had promised to continue the observations of sun and moon and he did so for more than ten years longer. The results laid down in his <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> work "De Revolutionibus Orbium C&oelig;lestium" (1543) enabled <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> Reinhold to compute the Prutenic Tables (Wittenberg, 1554), which were afterwards made the basis of the <a href="../cathen/03168a.htm">Gregorian reform</a>. The principal writers at the time are the following: <a href="../cathen/12082a.htm">Albertus Pighius</a>, magister at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, who dedicated to <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, in 1520, a treatise in which he supported Cardinal d'Ailly's intercalation, omitting a leap day every 134 years, but, on the other hand, recommended the retention of the lunar cycle. About the equinox he committed an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, reckoning it from the constellation of Aries and advising the omission of 16 days. The two Florentine <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, Joannes Lucidus and Joannes Maria de Tholosanis, may be mentioned in passing. The latter pleaded for cyclic reckoning but was opposed to changing the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the equinox. During the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> a number of plans were written and proposed to the council and to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/09641a.htm">Cardinal Marcellus Cervinus</a>, president of the council, summoned to <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> the Veronese Girolamo Fracastoro, a physician and renowned <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, and had several conferences with him on the subject of the calendar. In 1548 Bartholomeus Caligarius, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, offered a memorandum to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bitonto, wherein he based his plans on <a href="../cathen/11588b.htm">Paul of Middelburg</a>, Stoeffler, and Joannes Lucidus. The Spanish <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Joannes Salon, addressed a proposition to <a href="../cathen/06635a.htm">Cardinal Gonzaga</a>, first president of the council under <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>. An abridgment of it he offered, immediately after the council, in 1564, to <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, and, on the advice of <a href="../cathen/14027a.htm">Sirleto</a>, also to <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, in 1577. His memorandum is remarkable for the reasons he puts forth against an immovable <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and for the advice that a leap day should be omitted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on the occasion of general jubilees.

<p>Other memoranda were that of Begninus, a canon of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, which was handed to <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm#iv">Cardinal de Lorraine</a> on his way to the council; that of Lucas Gauricus, who signed himself <em>Episcopus Civitatensis,</em> and based his "Calendarium Ecclesiasticum" of 1548 on <a href="../cathen/11588b.htm">Paul of Middelburg</a>; that of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Don Miguel of Valencia, which was presented to <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> in 1564. More important than all these was a plan proposed by the Veronese mathematician Petrus Pitatus. Basing his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> likewise on <a href="../cathen/11588b.htm">Paul of Middelburg</a> he wanted the lunar cycle retained and the equinox restored to C&aelig;sar's date, by the omission of fourteen days, which for two years should be taken from the seven months having 31 days each. His original <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, which took final effect in the <a href="../cathen/03168a.htm">Gregorian reform</a>, was to correct the Julian intercalation of the solar year, not every 134 years, but by full centuries. No earlier writer seems to have called attention to the fact, that applying the rule of 134 years three times comes, within a small <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, to the same thing as omitting three leap days in 400 years. His "Compendium" was published and offered to <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> in 1564. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> was the first since that of Nic&aelig;a that took a positive step towards a reform of the calendar. In the last session, 4 December, 1563, it charged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to reform both <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, which included the perpetual calendar.
<h3>After the Council of Trent</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> published a <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> (Rome, 1568), with a new perpetual calendar, which was faulty and soon discarded. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, the immediate successor of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, charged Carolus Octavianus Laurus, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> of mathematics at the Sapienza, with working out a plan of reform. It was completed in 1575, and it again recommended the correction of the intercalations by full centuries. A certain Paolo Clarante also composed a calendarium and offered it to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for examination. In 1576 the famous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the late Aloisius Lilius was presented to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> by his brother Antonius.

<p>Whether Antonius acted in response to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> request is not known. Certain it is that Aloisius Lilius commenced his work before the accession of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> to the throne and even before the publication of the new <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, spending ten years on it. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory</a> then organized a commission to decide upon the best plan of reform. During the many sessions the members of the commission changed several times. From the names of those who signed the report offered to <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> it may be inferred that its composition was intended to represent various nations, grades, and rites of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Besides four <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> there was the French Auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> Seraphinus Olivarius, the German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Christoph Clavius, the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> Petrus Ciaconus, and the Syrian Patriarch Nehemet Alla. Religious Orders were represented by Clavius, by the celebrated <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a> <a href="../cathen/04633a.htm">Ignatius Dantes</a> and, for a while, by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Teofilus Martius. The <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> we find represented by Vincentius Laureus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10478a.htm">Mondov&igrave;</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/14027a.htm">Cardinal Sirleto</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> was represented by Antonius Lilius, doctor of arts and medicine, and, as it seems, collaborator of his brother Aloisius in the reform. About the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> Ciaconus or Chacon nothing seems to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.

<p>The first president of the commission, Bishop Giglio, did not succeed in securing a majority. He favoured the corrections suggested for Lilius's <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> by the two professors of the Roman Sapienza, the mathematician Carolus Laurus and the professor of Greek, Giovanni Battista Gabio. The commission, however, condemned the corrections as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and addressed itself directly to <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>. Thomas Giglio, being promoted to the <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">See of Piacenza</a> in 1577, was superseded as president by the learned and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14027a.htm">Cardinal Sirleto</a>, a native of Calabria like Lilius. Another disagreement was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> Teofilus Martius, who was mentioned above. He blamed the commission for the spirit of innovation and for lack of reverence towards the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>; he wanted the equinox restored to the older Roman date 24 or 25 March; he rejected the new cycle of Lilius, and wanted the old cycle corrected; he accepted neither the Alphonsine nor the Prutenic Tables and he desired a leap day to be omitted every 124 years or ten years sooner than the Alphonsine Tables required. Teofilus put his dissent on record in a "Treatise on the Reform of the Calendar" (after 1578) and in a "Short Narration of the Controversy in the Congregation of the Calendar". This would seem to show that he was a member of the commission; at least for a time, for he did not sign the report of the latter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It was probably owing to his objections that the new cycle of Epacts was changed at least twice and recommended by the commission in a third or even later form.

<p>The opposition of the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> Teofilus against the innovation of the Epacts was supported by Alexander Piccolomini, coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>. If he was not a member of the commission, he was at least requested to express an opinion. He laid down his theories in a "Libellus on the new form of the ecclesiastical calendar" (Rome, 1578). He was influenced by the "Epitoma" of the Florentine Joannes Lucidus (1525). Underrating the exactness of the Alphonsine Tables he gave preference to Albategni's length of the year and advocated the correction of the Julian intercalation once in every hundred years (thinking the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to amount to one day in 106 years). Piccolomini's name is not among the eight that recommended the official report of the commission to <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> in 1580; they are: <a href="../cathen/14027a.htm">Sirleto</a>, Ignatius, Laureus, Olivarius, Clavius, Ciaconus, Lilius, <a href="../cathen/04633a.htm">Dantes</a>, all mentioned above. The last mentioned, usually called <a href="../cathen/04633a.htm">Ignazio Danti</a>, was afterwards made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01251a.htm">Alatri</a>. His scientific reputation may be inferred from the praises given to him more than a hundred years later (1703) by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> for his large solar instruments in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and Bologna, which affirmed the correctness of the Gregorian equinox. The instruments consisted of meridian lines and gnomons. The former were usually strips of white marble inset in stone floors. The gnomon was sometimes replaced by a small opening in a wall which projected the image of the sun on the meridian line. An arrangement of this description is visible in the old <a href="../cathen/15309a.htm">Vatican Observatory</a>, called the Tower of the Winds. It was on this line that, according to Gilii and Calandrelli, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of ten days was demonstrated in the presence of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of Lilius was never printed and has never been discovered. Its contents are known only from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> report of the commission and from the "Compendium" of Ciaconus, which was printed by Clavius. The request of Charante, that his "Calendarium" be distributed together with the "Compendium", was not granted by the commission. The "Compendium" was sent out in 1577 to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes and renowned universities, to invite <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> or criticism. With Lilius, it left open the questions, whether the equinox should be placed on 24 March or 21 March, following the old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Calendar</a> or the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>; and if the latter (which seemed preferable), whether the ten days should be omitted at once, in some suitable month of 1582, or gradually by declaring all of the next forty years common years and thus completing the reform in 1620. That the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from the Nic&aelig;an regulation of the equinox had amounted to ten days, was sufficiently known from various observers, like <a href="../cathen/14786a.htm">Toscanelli</a>, <a href="../cathen/04633a.htm">Danti</a>, <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a> (Calandrelli, "Opuscoli Astronomici", Rome, 1822, 30). The motions of sun and moon were taken from the Alphonsine Tables. Whether the Prutenic Tables of 1554 were at the time known to Lilius may be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. He could be no stranger, however, to Cardinal d'Ailly's "Exhortatio ad Concilium Constantiense", in which the Julian intercalation was shown to be one day in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> every 134 years, or to the proposition of the Veronese mathematician Pitatus, who wanted the correction applied by a cycle of four centuries. Lilius considered fractions of centuries unfit for all cyclic or non- <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> reckoning and used centurial corrections for both solar and lunar motions.

<p>Lilius's masterpiece is the new "Nineteen Years' Cycle of Epacts", by which he kept the Nic&aelig;an <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> regulation apace with the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> moon. The old lunar cycle gave the lunations four or more days in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> could thus (by taking the Sunday after Luna XIV) fall on Luna XXVI, within a few days of the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> new moon. Lilius brought the new cycle of Epacts in harmony with the year by two equations so called, the solar and the lunar. The solar equation diminishes the epacts by a unit whenever a Julian leap day is omitted, as in 1900; the lunar equation increases the epacts by unity every 300 years, or (after seven repetitions, the eighth time) in 400 years. The former equation accounts for the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the Julian year and the latter for the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the Metonic cycle. The Greek cycle is longer than 19 years and the surplus amounts to one day in 310 years. This will explain the lunar equation, and also show that greater exactness could be reached by applying the interval of 400 years the tenth time. It may happen that the two equations cancel each other and leave the epacts unchanged, as happened in 1800. The new cycle of epacts, with the two equations, were joined to the "Compendium". Answers to the "Compendium" are on record from Emperor Rudolf, from the Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, from the Dukes of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, from the Republics of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, from the Universities or Academies of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Salamanca, Alcal&aacute;, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, from several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and a number of mathematicians.
<h3>The bull "Inter Gravissimas"</h3>

<p>The contents of the answers are not officially recorded, but in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory</a> they are called concordant. How the concordance is to be understood may be illustrated by the answers from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and from Florence. While the Sorbonne not only rejected the "Compendium" but condemned every change in the calendar, the king's Parlement fully adopted the reform proposed by Lilius. The Duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> forwarded to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the judgments of several Florentine mathematicians, no two of which agreed among themselves, while he himself gave full approval to the <a href="../cathen/03168a.htm">Gregorian reform</a>. The King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> presented two professional answers without adding a judgment of his own. The emperor also confined himself to forwarding the reply from the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>. The answers from <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> were in <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of Lilius's plan. All the princes may have seen the necessity of a reform and desired it. This is confirmed by a letter of the Cardinal Secretary of State to <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">Charles Borromeo</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 16 June, 1582, in which the statement is made that the reform of the calendar was concluded with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes. The consent of the princes had more influence with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> than the opinion of scientists. To bring about an agreement of the latter was utterly hopeless, and, in view of the labours of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commission, unnecessary. The variety of opinion, collected by Kaltenbrunner and Schmid, bears testimony to this, quite apart from the bitter polemics that followed the <a href="../cathen/03168a.htm">Gregorian reform</a> and which does not concern us in this article.

<p>The propositions made in answer to the "Compendium" may be summed up as follows. In regard to the solar year, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the equinox should be 25 March, where Julius C&aelig;sar had put it &#151; this was the wish of the Humanists &#151; or on 24 March, where it was at the time of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's resurrection</a> &#151; this was the proposal of Salamanca &#151; or 21 March, where the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> had put it, or finally should be left on 11 March, where it was at the time. Those who would not accept the correction of the Julian intercalation by full centuries wanted a leap day omitted as often as the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> amounted to a full day &#151; by the Alphonsine Tables every 134 years &#151; or, as the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of the Sorbonne demanded, no correction at all. As to the lunar cycle, no <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> attempted an improvement on Lilius's epacts. Salamanca and Alcal&aacute;, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from a letter of Clavius to Moleto in <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, fully approved Lilius's reform. <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> rejected all cyclical computation, while the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of the Sorbonne pleaded for the retention of the old cycle, uncorrected. The answers from <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> deserve special mention because of the full approval of Lilius's calendar by the famous <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> Cornelius Gemma, while Zeelstius (1581) sided with the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>. The answers from Padua were peculiar. Macigni, in a letter to <a href="../cathen/14027a.htm">Sirleto</a> (1580), accepted the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Spanish <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Salon and proposed that during general jubilees a number of mathematicians be called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to decide upon the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the equinox. Apparently the first to advocate an immovable <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a> was Sperone Speroni, who calls himself a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in mathematics. According to him <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> should be fixed on the Sunday nearest to the 25 March; or, as the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> Franciscus Flussas Candalla proposed, on the Sunday nearest the equinox.

<p>Thus, every imaginable proposition was made; only one <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was never mentioned, viz. the abandonment of the seven-day week. The answers delayed the publication of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> from 1581 to 1582, and some arrived even later. The consent of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes on the one side and the variety of scientific opinions on the other left to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commission no alternative, but forced it to follow its own judgment. The final framing of the reform seems to have been in great part the work of Clavius; for he alone afterwards took up its defence and furnished full explanations ("Apologia", 1588; "Explicatio", 1603; see <a href="../cathen/04008a.htm">C<font size=-2>LAVIUS</font></a>). <a href="../cathen/14027a.htm">Sirleto</a> writes of him that he was among the foremost workers in the reform (<em>cum primis egregie laboravit</em>), and <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> says, in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Qu&aelig;cumque" (17 March, 1603), that Clavius did signal services for the calendar. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commission decided, 17 March, 1580, that out of reverence for <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a>, the equinox should be restored to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>. The majority, under the leadership of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10478a.htm">Mondov&igrave;</a>, declared itself against <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> lunations and for the cycle of Epacts. Lilius's century rule for the ommission of leap days was adopted, but his lunar cycle was modified. The Prutenic Tables were made the basis, and the epacts were all diminished by unity, in other words, Luna XIV was put one day later, to remove all danger of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> ever being celebrated on the day of the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> full moon, as was forbidden by the old canons. It is known that the month of October, 1582, was to have twenty-one days (not twenty, as Montucla says) and the ten days should be expunged by passing from 4 October to 15 October. The reform, as recommended by the commission on 14 September, 1580, received <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Inter Gravissimus", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 24 February, 1581, and published on 1 March, 1582. The decrees of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> were in this manner put on a cyclical basis that secured their correctness for nearly four thousand years, a space of time more than long enough for any human institution. The original task of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commission seems to have exceeded its strength and time. The dates of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> were actually computed for the next three thousand years; the "Liber Nov&aelig; Rationis Restituendi Calendarii", which was to accompany the reform, was never written, and the Martyrology did not appear until 1588 under <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. In 1603, Clavius was the only surviving member of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commission. It was by command of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> that he composed his "Explanation of the new Calendar".
