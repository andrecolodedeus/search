<h1>Alonso Berruguete</h1>  

<p>For his mastery of the arts of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, and architecture, sometimes called the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, b. at Paredes de Nava, in Castile, about 1480; d. at Toledo, 1561. He was the second son of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, Pedro Berruguete, who was his first instructor. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, however, chose the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for his profession and obtained for him an official position at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, the title of which he held for years, probably long after he had devoted himself to art. It is said that the fame of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> led him to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> after his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death and he entered the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of that great master in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> and had among his friends Andrea del Sarto and Bandinelli. In the competition with Leonardo he made a copy of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Buonarroti's</a> great cartoon of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. Accompanying his master to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he assisted him in the Vatican, he was one of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> chosen by <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a> to compete in making a copy of the Laocoon to be cast in bronze, <a href="../cathen/13453c.htm">Sansovino</a>, however, being the winner. On his return to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, he was engaged by the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of San Geronimo to finish an altarpiece left unfinished at his death by <a href="../cathen/09278a.htm">Filippo Lippi</a>. After a long residence in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Berruguete, in 1520, went back to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he was greatly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, who appointed him a chamberlain, and court <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, and gave him much work to do at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, at the Palace of El Pardo, and at the Alhambra. With Philip II he continued in favour and became a rich man, married a lady of quality and bought the lordship of Ventosa near Valladolid. After his return to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the artist lived for some time at <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, where he made an altar and a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> for the church of Santa Engracia. At Valladolid he executed many works for churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, notable among which is the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Benito el Real, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, on which he spent six years. Berruguete worked with Filipe de Vigar on the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Toledo. There also, in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. John the Baptist, is one of his finest works, executed when he was nearly eighty years of age, the monument of its founder, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> Juan de Tavera. His best work in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> is considered to be in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a> and in the church of Ventosa; his best work in bronze and marble in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and other buildings of Toledo.
