<h1>Alonso Rodriguez</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1526; died at Seville 21 February, 1616. When twenty years of age he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and after completing his studies taught <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> for twelve years at the College of Monterey, and subsequently filled the posts of master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> for twelve more years, of <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> for seventeen years, and of spiritual father at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> for eleven years. As master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> he had under his charge Francis Francisco Su&aacute;rez, the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>. Alonso's characteristics in these offices were care, diligence, and charity. He was a religious of great <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and candour, hating all <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and ostentation. It was said of him by those who were personally acquainted with him, that his character and virtues were accurately depicted in "The Practice of Christian and Religious Perfection", published at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, 1609. This work is based on the material which he collected for his spiritual exhortations to his brethren, and published at the request of his superiors. Although the book thus written was primarily intended for the use of his religious brethren, yet he destined it also for the profit and edification of other religious and of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> in the world. Of set purpose it avoids the loftier flights of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> and all abstruse speculation. It is a book of practical instructions on all the virtues which go to make up the <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect Christian life</a>, whether lived in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> or in the world. It became popular at once, and it is much used today by all classes of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as it was when it first became known. More than twenty-five editions of the original Spanish have been issued, besides extracts and abridgements. Moe than sixty editions have appeared in French in seven different translations, twenty in Italian, at least ten in German, and eight in Latin. An English translation from the French by Fr. Antony Hoskins, S.J., was printed at <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a> in 1612. The best known English translation, often reprinted, is that which first appeared in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 1697, from the French of Abb&eacute; Regnier des Marais. P.O. Shea issued in New York an edition adapted to general use in 1878. The book has been translated into nearly all the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages and into many of those of the East. No other work of the author was published. Gilmary Shea left a translation of the work which has never been published.
