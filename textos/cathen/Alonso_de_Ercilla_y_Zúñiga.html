<h1>Alonso de Ercilla y Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> soldier and poet, born in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 7 August, 1533; died in the same city, 29 November, 1594. After his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death, his mother became lady-in-waiting to the Infanta Mar&iacute;a and made young Alonso a page to Prince Philip. Ercilla received a very thorough <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, for, besides having the most learned teachers, he enjoyed the advantages of very extensive travelling and of living at court where he came in contact with high personages. When he was only fifteen he accompanied Philip through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; and their travels lasted three years. Later, Ercilla accompanied his mother to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> where he left her and then visited <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and other countries. Returning to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he soon started out again with Philip. In <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> he made the acquaintance of Jer&oacute;nimo de Alderete (1555), whose stories of his thrilling adventures in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> so fired Ercilla's <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> that he determined to accompany Alderete to the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. He therefore obtained leave from Philip, and they set sail for America, 15 Oct., 1555. Soon after their arrival, however, Alderete died (near Panam&aacute;, April, 1556). Ercilla continued on his way to <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, and in 1557 joined the forces of Garc&iacute;a Hurtado de Mendoza, who had recently been appointed Governor of <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>. During the succeeding two or three years he played a brilliant part in combating an insurrection among the natives of Arauco, a province of <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, suffering great hardships, and distinguishing himself several times in battle. After a severe illness he returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 15622, and for a time resumed his travels through <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In 1570, he married Do&ntilde;a Mar&iacute;a de Baz&aacute;n, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> attainments. He died at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> neglected and in great poverty.

<p>Ercilla's great work is La Araucana, an epic poem of thirty-seven cantos, describing the difficulties encountered by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> during the insurrection in Arauco, and the heroic deeds of the natives as well as his companions. The epic partakes of the character of history, and the author adheres with such strict fidelity to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that subsequent historians characterize his work as thoroughly trustworthy. In it the difficult art of story-telling is carried to perfection. Places are admirably described, dates are given with accuracy, and the customs of the native faithfully set forth, giving to the narrative animation and colouring. The poem was published in three parts, the first appearing in 1569, the second in 1578, and the third in 1590. The best editions are those published by the Spanish Academy in 1776 and 1828.
