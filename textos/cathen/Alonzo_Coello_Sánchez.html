<h1>Alonzo Coello S&aacute;nchez</h1>  

<p>Born at Benyfayro, Valenciz, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1513 or 1515; died at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1590. His name Coello is certainly Portuguese, and was probably that of his mother. From his intimate conexion with <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, Philip II constantly referred to him as his "Portuguese <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>". We have no definite information that S&aacute;nchez* was ever in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but he certainly carefully copied the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a> under the influence of <a href="../cathen/10555b.htm">Sir Antonio Mor</a>, who was his great master. In 1552 he accompanied him to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> when Mor was sent by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the portraits of the royal family, and S&aacute;nchez* then entered into the service of Don Juan of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, who had married Joanna, the daughter of Charles and the sister of Philip II. On the death of the Infante Don Juan, his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> recommended her <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> to her brother Philip, and as Mor had just left the Court and retired to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, Philip II appointed Coello <em>pintor de c&aacute;mara</em>. He was one of the earliest of the Spanish court portrait-painters, and as his work was in great demand he became a rich man. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, many of the grandees of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Cardinal Farnese, and the Dukes of Florence and <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. He also executed considerable work at the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the triumphal arch erected at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> for the entry of Anne of Austria, wife of Philip II. Perhaps his most notable portrait, however, was that of <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>, executed from casts taken twenty-nine years before, and from instructions and sketches made by one of the fathers. His greatest portrait was that of his friend, Father Sig&uuml;enza, which was engraved by Selma. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, where he had founded a <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">home for foundling children</a>. His epitaph was written by L&oacute;pez de Vega. S&aacute;nchez's colouring resembles that of <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, and his portraits are powerful and lifelike. There is one in the National Portrait Gallery in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, another at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, three at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and several at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. One of the churches of that city also possesses a screen decorated by him and intended to be used during <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>. His pictures have always been highly esteemed in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where they have sold for very large sums of money on the few occasions when they came into the market. Coello <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> Philip II in almost every kind of costume, on foot and on horseback, and in many attitudes, but he is not generally considered to have been as successful with his royal patron as he was with some of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, whose portraits he drew in noble proportions.
