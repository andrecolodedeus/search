<h1>Alonzo S&aacute;nchez</h1>  

<p>Born in Mondejar, <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1547; died at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a>, 27 May, 1593. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> on 27 May, 1565. He was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Navalcarnero, taught grammar for five years, and in 1579 went to the mission of Mexico, where he was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Early in 1581 he set out for the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> with Bishop Salazar. S&aacute;nchez* and his companion, Antonio Sedeno, and a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> were the first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in these islands. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> made S&aacute;nchez* his counsellor, appointed him to write the acts of the synod of <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, and, when S&aacute;nchez* was sent on an embassy to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, interrupted the synod until S&aacute;nchez* had returned. Twice S&aacute;nchez* was despatched on official business to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, where he met celebrated <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries of that country and from <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. He was thus able to publish later an interesting and curious acocunt of the state of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> at the end of the sixteenth century. By the unanimous vote of all the Spanish officials, civil and religious, of the merchants and other leading citizens, S&aacute;nchez* was chosen to go to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> as representative of the colony in 1586. S&aacute;nchez's mission to Philip II was very successful, his arguments moving the king to retain the islands, which many of his advisors had been urging him to abandon. From <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was there welcomed by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Pope Sixtus V</a>, from whom he received many privileges for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. In a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 28 June, 1591, <a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a> praises the apostolic labours and writings of S&aacute;nchez, calling him a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> defender of the authority and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. <a href="../cathen/08020a.htm">Innocent IX</a> addressed to him the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Inter felices", in which he lauds his work. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> at his request granted various favours to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the islands. S&aacute;nchez* gave an account of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> to Aquaviva, the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. It had been proposed to withdraw the fathers from the Archipelago, but Aquaviva, following the plan proposed by S&aacute;nchez, determined that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> should remain, and made the Manila residence a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> with Sedeno as its first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. S&aacute;nchez* now asked to be allowed to return to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, but was sent instead as visitor to some of the Spanish provinces of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, where serious domestic and external troubles menaced the well-being of the entire <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. The singular tact of S&aacute;nchez* gained the day; he expelled some influential but turbulent members from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, and won over the king, the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, and prominent personages, so that they became better disposed towards the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> than ever before. S&aacute;nchez* was elected one of the representatives of the Province of Toledo to the Fifth General Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, but he remarked that he had a more important journey to make than the one to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He died twelve days later on the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">feast of the Ascension</a>. Distinguished for unusual <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> gifts, S&aacute;nchez* was no less remarkable for his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life; his penances were those of an <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> as prolonged as that of any contemplative. His writings include chiefly short treatises, memorials, and the like. A catalogue and summary of forty-one of these, drawn up by the author, is given by Col&iacute;n.
