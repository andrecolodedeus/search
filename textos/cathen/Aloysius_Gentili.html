<h1>Aloysius Gentili</h1>  

<p>Born 14 July, 1801, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; died 26 September, 1848, at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. He was proficient in poetry, displayed considerable musical aptitude, had a taste for mechanical and electrical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and was devoted to the cultivation of modern languages, applying himself more particularly to the study of English. His early life was that of a brilliant young man of the world, full of <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of a nobler kind, a pet of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and an evident favourite of fortune. He sought admission into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and would have been accepted, but his health seemed broken, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> did not venture to receive him. He became more and more impressed with the conviction that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> called him to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and to labour for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He made, the acquaintance of Father <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a> who, at his earnest entreaty, accepted him as a <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulant</a> of the newly-founded Institute of Charity. He remained in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, attending <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> lectures whilst residing at the <a href="../cathen/08157a.htm">Irish College</a>, in order, at the same time, to improve his English, and after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, in 1830, proceeded to Domo d'Ossola to make his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>.

<p>Whilst Gentili was living at the <a href="../cathen/08157a.htm">Irish College</a>, a young English gentleman, who had been converted whilst a student at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, arrived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This was <a href="../cathen/04698c.htm">Mr. Ambrose Phillips de Lisle</a>. This <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> convert applied to the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08157a.htm">Irish College</a>, to obtain for him a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to preach the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in the neighbourhood of his ancestral home. The <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> suggested the Abate Gentili as in every way suited to the purpose. This led to a great friendship between the young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/04698c.htm">Mr. de Lisle</a>, the submission of the whole project to <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, and eventually to the coming of Gentili and other fathers to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1835. It was not merely the invitation of <a href="../cathen/04698c.htm">Mr. Phillips de Lisle</a> that brought the <a href="../cathen/13198a.htm">Rosminians</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In the meantime, one of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, <a href="../cathen/02207d.htm">Bishop Baines</a>, who then ruled over the Western District, having his residence at <a href="../cathen/02347a.htm">Bath</a>, had sought to obtain the services of the fathers for his college of Prior Park. Though <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a> gave his consent as early as 1831, the period of preparation for the English Mission was a long one; for the little band did not sail from Civita Vecchia till 22 May, 1835. They set forth with a more personal blessing and mission from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> than even St. Augustine and his companions received from <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> for <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> actually came on board the vessel and blessed the three as "Italian missioners", just before they sailed, probably a unique event in missionary history. Gentili and his companions arrived in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> on 15 June, and no time was lost in getting to work. A few days later Gentili preached his first sermon in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, at Trelawney House, in Cornwall, whither they had been invited by Sir Henry Trelawney, Bart., a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> convert. He took for his text, "Thou art <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, and upon this rock I will build my church", and his discourse made a remarkable impression upon the many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who came to hear it. Soon after, the missionaries were settled at Prior Park, where early in the following year (1836) Gentili gave a retreat to the whole college; and this was one of the first, if not the first public retreat according to the method of St. Ignatius given in a secular college in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. For this reason it excited among some no little criticism and opposition as a "novelty".

<p>For two years Gentili was made president of Prior Park; but <a href="../cathen/02207d.htm">Bishop Baines'</a> plan of combining <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> professors on his staff was an ill-advised one, and eventually led to the only possible result, viz., the entire withdrawal of the fathers from Prior Park College. This step left them free to devote their energies and their increasing numbers to the real work for which they came--preaching the Faith to the English people. In 1840 was opened the missionary settlement at Grace-Dieu, the seat of <a href="../cathen/04698c.htm">Mr. Philips de Lisle</a>, from which as a centre they evangelized much of the surrounding country, the total population of which region was reckoned at 6000, of which only twenty - seven were catholics. Notwithstanding the unpromising surroundings, the bitter hostility of the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and Gentili's being publicly burnt in effigy, his ceaseless labours were rewarded on a space of some two years, by the reception sixty-one adult converts, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of sixty-six children under seven years of age and of twenty other children conditionally, and the conversion of an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, Rev. Francis Wackerbarth. These consoling fruits were secured by incessant toil, daily instructions, visits, and religious services of every kind, sometimes in inns or hired rooms, sometimes in a poor cottage, or even in the open air. In the meantime the numbers of the Fathers had much grown. Among the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> are now to be mentioned Fathers Pagalli, Rinolfi, and Signini; while some Englishmen and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> had joined their ranks, notably the afterwards celebrated Fathers Furlong and Hutton. In 1842 Gentili visited Oxford, where it is probable, but not certain, that he met <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>. At any rate the visit had important consequences. For Gentili did meet one of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> chief and best-beloved followers, William Lockhart, a young Scotch graduate. The result was that during August of the following year, "Mr. Lockhart, feeling it impossible to resist his conviction that the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> had fallen into fatal Schism in separating from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, came to visit Father Gentili at Loughborough. After making a few days retreat under him in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> house at Loughborough, he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and a little later, entered as a <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulant</a> of the Order". This conversion was the very first fruit of the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>, preceding the reception of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> himself by no less than two years.

<p>The first public mission was given at Loughborough by Fathers Gentili and Furlong, and had an extraordinary success. Sixty-three converts were instructed and received at it. From this time forward, the work of the fathers takes a new and far wider development. Great public missions all over the country alternate with innumerable spiritual retreats to colleges and communities for the next five years. It was a stirring-up of the minds and hearts of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and a gathering into the net of converts from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, on a scale which astonishes us as we read of it at this distance of time. Some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> may be given of the labours and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the fathers from what has been recorded of various great public missions. They usually gave four or five discourses daily, at fixed intervals, taking the sermons alternately, treating both dogmatic and moral Gospel doctrines, especially the great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, the mystery of the Redemption, the Divine <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, the Life of Christ. And the whole of the time intervening between the discourses was devoted to the arduous work of the confessional. So great usually was the concourse of penitents, that the fathers were kept occupied for eight or ten hours a day. Sometimes they even remained in church all night long, hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, and had absolutely no time either to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, or recite the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> much less take any sleep, or any nourishment, except in a hasty manner. Such wearisome labours were not interrupted, but only varied, for weeks and even months together. They had to prepare children for their First Communion, instruct converts restore peace in <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, see to the restitution of ill-gotten goods. They also introduced processions, evening Benedictions, and other solemn functions at the close of missions.

<p>The years 1844 to 1848 were fully occupied with an incredible number of popular missions and retreats all over <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. At Newcastle 250 adult <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> missions in three of the principal churches produced to less than 378 converts. It was in 1848 that Gentili gave his great mission in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, where, in spite of the political excitement of that year, the confessionals were so crowded, that the Fathers often sat there without a break from the last instruction at night till the Mass on the following morning. But a sad and altogether unexpected blow brought to a sudden end the labours of this great mission. Father Gentili, the pioneer missioner, was suddenly seized with a fatal fever, and died after only a few days illness. His mortal remains still repose in Glasnevin Cemetery.
