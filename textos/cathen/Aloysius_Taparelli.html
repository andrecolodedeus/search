<h1>Aloysius Taparelli</h1>  

<p>(D'AZEGLIO, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">christened</a> PROSPERO)

<p><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">Philosopher</a> and writer on sociological subjects, born at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, 24 Nov., 1793; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 20 Sept., 1862; <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> near the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> of St. Aloysius in the Church of St. Ignatius.

<p>His father, Cesare, was at one time ambassador of Victor Emmanuel I of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and his brother, Massimo, was one of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of State. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> under the Calasanctians at Senis and in the Atheneo of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. He attended the military <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St-Cyr at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for some months, but he was not destined to be a soldier. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 12 Nov., 1814. In his youth he displayed a bent for mechanics, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, and music, and later invented a musical instrument which he called the <em>violicembolo</em> (highly praised by <a href="../cathen/09285b.htm">Liszt</a> and afterwards at his suggestion named the <em>symphonium</em>), and which was exhibited at the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Exhibition. He was the first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Roman College after its restoration to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> by <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>. He taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> for sixteen years at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, and for many years afterwards was attached to the editorial staff of the "Civilt&agrave; Cattolica". His chief work, "Saggio teoretico di diritto naturale appogiato sul fatto", i.e. "A Theoretical Essay on Natural Right from an Historical Standpoint" (2 vols., 7th ed., Rome, 1883), was in a way the beginning of modern sociology. It was translated into German (Ratisbon, 1845) and twice into French (Tournai, 1851; Paris, 1896). Herein was developed the position, at once widely accepted in conservative circles on the Continent, that the normal origin of civil government was by extension of paternal power through the patriarchal head of a group of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. This essay was later abridged into "An Elementary Course in Natural Right" (6th ed., Naples, 1860; also in French, <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, 1864; and in <a href="../cathen/14192a.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1875), which was in use as a text-book in the University of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>. Next in importance is his "Esame critico degli ordini rappresentativi nella societ&agrave; moderna", i.e. "Critical Examination of Representative Government in Modern Society" (2 vols., Rome, 1854; in <a href="../cathen/14192a.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1867). Besides his striking monographs on "Nationality" (Rome, 1847), "Sovereignty of the People" (Palermo, 1848; Florence, 1849), and "The Grounds of War" (Genoa, 1847) he left a long list of articles in the "Civilt&agrave; Cattolica" chiefly on subjects in political economy and social right, as well as an equally long list of book reviews on kindred topics, which were acute and penetrating essays.
