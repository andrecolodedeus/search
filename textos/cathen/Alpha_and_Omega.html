<h2>In Jewish theology</h2>

<p>When <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> passed before the face of Moses on Sinai the great Law-giver of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> called out: "Jehova, Jehova and merciful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of long-suffering, and full of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" [(<a href="../bible/exo034.htm#vrs6">Exodus 34:6</a>), in the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay Version</a>, "0 the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, merciful and gracious, patient and of much compassion, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>"]. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> being is fullness of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> &#151; <em>Plenitudo veri et boni</em> in the Latin translation. They are foremost among <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> moral attributes. They are the immediate outcome of His Divine operations. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> pure spirit. His being is Intellect and Will. Truth is the final object of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> is that of the will. In the psalter they are praised and invoked by the poet with holy and loving fondness, e.g. Pss., xxiv, 10; xxxix, 11, 12; lvi, 4, 11; lxxxiv, 11; lxxxv, 15; cxvi, 2. Of the two perfections <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, the former ranks higher. Truth is the first of all perfections. The <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <em>Emeth</em>. It is composed of three letters: Aleph=Alpha, Mem=My, and Thaw=Theta. The Aleph and the Thaw are the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet as the <a href="../cathen/01332a.htm">Alpha and Omegain Scripture)</a> are of the Greek. Thus the term <em>Emeth</em> (truth) begins with the first letter of the alphabet and ends with the last. This letter of the alphabet and ends with the last. This led the Jewish sages to find in this word a mystical meaning. The Aleph or the first letter of <em>Emeth</em>(truth) denotes that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first of all things. There was no one before Him of whom He could have received the fullness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The Thaw, or last letter, in like manner signifies that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the last of all things. There will be no one after Him to whom He could bequeath it. Thus <em>Emeth</em> is a sacred word expressing that in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> dwells absolutely and in all plenitude. <em>Emeth</em>, as the Jewish divines truly say, is the <em>signaculum Dei essentia</em> (see Buxtori's Lexicon). In Yoma 69b., and Sanh. 64a., the following is related: "The men of the great <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to remove from the earth the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil Spirit</a>, as the cause of all trouble. Immediately a scroll fell from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> with the word Truth written thereon, and thereupon a fiery lion came out of the sanctuary. It was the spirit of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> leaving the earth". "This legend shows", says Hanina "that the seal of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>". (Jewish Encyclopedia.)
<h2>In Christian usage</h2>

<p>The manner of expressing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> by means of the first and last letters of the alphabet seems to have passed from from the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In place of the Aleph and Thaw, the <a href="../cathen/01332a.htm">Alpha and Omegain Scripture)</a> were substituted. But the substitution of the Greek letters for those of the Hebrew tongue inevitably caused a portion of the meaning and beauty in thus designating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be lost. The Greek letters <a href="../cathen/01332a.htm">Alpha and Omegain Scripture)</a> have no relation to the word Truth. Omega is not the last letter of the word <em>aletheia</em> (truth), as Thaw is of the word <em>Emeth</em>. The sacred and mystical word <em>Truth</em>, expressing in Hebrew, through its letters Aleph and Thaw, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> absolute and eternal being, had to be sacrificed. "Alpha-Omega" (and its Hebrew equivalent) signify an absolute plenitude, or perfection. It is a Jewish saying that the blessing on <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in Lev., xxvi, 3-13, is complete because it begins with Aleph and ends with Thaw. <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah's</a> absolute perfection is expressed in <a href="../bible/isa041.htm#vrs4">Isaiah 41:4</a> and <a href="../bible/isa044.htm#vrs6">44:6</a> by the phrase, "I am the first and the last". <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, "De Legibus", IV, 715, describes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the same manner: <em>archen te kai teleuten kai mesa ton onton apanton echon</em>, and quotes this phrase as a <em>palaios logos</em>. Cf. also <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, C. Apion., II, xxiii. The phrase fitly expresses the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is eternal, the beginning and end of all things. The <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">fourth Gospel</a>, after stating that the "Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", says, "and the Word dwelt among us full of grace and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>". Grace stands for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. The phrase is identical with <a href="../bible/exo034.htm#vrs6">Exodus 34:6</a>, "full of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>". We have here the two great divine attributes, Truth and Goodness, assigned to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in all their fullness. What Moses has said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> says of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In the Apocalypse the "Alpha-Omega" taking the place of its Hebrew equivalent occur in the first chapter to designate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs8">1:8</a>); but in the last two chapters to designate <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/rev021.htm#vrs6">Revelation 21:6</a> and <a href="../bible/rev022.htm#vrs13">22:13</a>). It is an argument that its author believed in the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In the earlier ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/01332a.htm">Alpha and Omegain Scripture)</a> were used as the monogram of Christ. These letters became His crest. The poet Prudentius says, "Alpha et Omega cognominatus, ipse fons et clausula omnium quae sunt, fuerunt, quaeque post future sunt" (Cathemer., 9, 11). The "Alpha-Omega" symbol was written under the arms of the cross within a circle or triangle. <a href="../images/01332aax.gif">(Fig. 1)</a>. Sometimes the Alpha is found on the right and the Omega on the left to indicate that in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the beginning and the end are joined into one. <a href="../images/01332aax.gif">(Fig. 2)</a>. This crest is found on the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of the Emperor Constans and Constantius (<a href="../cathen/09723b.htm">Martigny</a>, 458-459). <a href="../images/01332aax.gif">(Fig. 3)</a>. The early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had the two letters engraved on their signet rings [<a href="../images/01332aax.gif">Fig. 4</a> (Vigouroux, Biblical Lexicon)]. Sometimes the Alpha and the Omega are written in the Nimbus, or halo, of the Lamb; for instance, in the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a> of Petrus and Marcellinus, third century. We further find these two letters in frescoes and <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of several ancient churches; for instance, in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06028a.htm">St. Felicitas</a>, and in San Marco in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; in the world-famed <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, in Galla Placidia, St. Crisologo, St. Vitale. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> <a href="../cathen/01332a.htm">Alpha and Omegain Scripture)</a> ceased to be used as the monogram of Christ for church <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and ornaments. During the last centuries the letters I.H.S. (see <a href="../cathen/01022a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL ABBREVIATIONS</a>) have completely taken their place. Recently, however, on tabernacle doors and antependia the older device is again met with.
