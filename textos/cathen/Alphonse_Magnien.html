<h1>Alphonse Magnien</h1>  

<p>An educator of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, born at Bleymard, in the <a href="../cathen/10180a.htm">Diocese of Mende</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 9 June, 1837; died 21 December, 1902. As a student of classics at Chirac, and of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (1857-1862), he was distinguished for sound and brilliant talents and a noble, attractive character, he had become affiliated to the <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Diocese of Orl&eacute;ans</a> in response to <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Mgr Dupanloup's</a> appeal for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> recruits. In the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> he developed a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician vocation; but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> postponed the fulfilment of his desire, employing him for two years after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> in 1862 as professor in the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of La Chapelle St-Mesmin. He then became successively, under the direction of his Sulpician superiors, professor of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> (1864-65), and professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> at <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a> (1866-69). At length, in the fall of 1869, Father Magnien began the work at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> which made him so well known to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of America. He soon revealed himself at St. Mary's as a born teacher, first in his course of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and, later, of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. He seemed instinctively to grasp the vital part of a question and rested content only when he had found the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>After the death of Dr. Dubreul, superior of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, in 1878, Father Magnien was appointed to the succession. As superior of St. Mary's Seminary during a quarter of a century, Father Magnien exercised the widest influence on the formation of the American <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He was richly endowed for his predestined work. He was a naturally upright, frank, manly character; and above all he was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and supremely interested in the spread of religion. He spoke to the seminarians out of the abundance of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> heart and from a full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> life. Nowhere was he so much at home as on the rostrum. To speak almost daily on spiritual topics without becoming tiresome is a task of rare difficulty; few men, indeed, could stand the test so well as Father Magnien. In the administration of his office there was nothing narrow or harsh. He had a keen <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of conditions in this country. He used to say at the close of his life "I have trusted very much and been sometimes deceived; but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that had I trusted less I would have been still oftener deceived."

<p>This generous and wise sentiment characterizes the man and partially reveals the secret of his influence. Father Magnien was <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> and revered. He had strong affections; he had also strong dislikes, but not so uncontrollable as to lead him into an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> contributed, in no small degree, to the growth and prosperity of St. Mary's Seminary. Under his administration St. Austin's College was founded at the Catholic University, Washington, for the recruiting of American vocations to St. Sulpice. His abilities as a churchman and a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> were conspicuously revealed at the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>.

<p>Throughout his life, his wise counsel was frequently sought and highly valued by many members of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and he was a father to many of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He frequently preached retreats to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; during the retreat at St. Louis in 1897, he was seized with an attack of a disease from which he had suffered for years. Some months later he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for special treatment, where he underwent a very dangerous operation, and returned to his post at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. His health, however, was never entirely regained and after two or three years began to fail markedly, and in the summer of 1902 he resigned his burden. The good he wrought in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in America can never be told. In my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and veneration for his memory, I may be permitted to add that he was to me, for more than a quarter of a century, a most affectionate, devoted, and faithful friend, and a wise and able counsellor.
