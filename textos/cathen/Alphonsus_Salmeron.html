<h1>Alphonsus Salmeron</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Biblical scholar, born at Toledo, 8 Sept., 1515; died at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 13 Feb., 1585. He studied literature and philosophy at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a>, and thereafter went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Here, through James Lainez, he met <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius of Loyola</a>; together with Lainez, Faber, and <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> he enlisted as one of the first companions of Loyola (1536). The small company left <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 15 Nov., 1536, and reached <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 8 Jan., 1537, and during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> of that year went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He delivered a discourse before the Holy Father and was, in return, granted leave to receive <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> so soon as he should have reached the canonical age. About 8 Sept., all the first companions met at Vincenza, and all, save St. Ignatius, said their first Mass. The plan of a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land was abandoned. Salmeron devoted his ministry in Sienna to the poor and to children. On 22 April, 1541, he pronounced his solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul's-Outside-the-Walls</a>, as a professed member of the newly-established <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. The autumn of that year, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> sent Salmeron and Bro&euml;t as Apostolic <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. They landed, by way of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, 23 Feb., 1542. Thirty-four days later they set sail for Dieppe and went on to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. For two years Salmeron preached in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; his exposition of the Epistle to the Ephesians thrice a week in the church of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> effected much good (1545). After preaching the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> at Bologna, he went with Lainez to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (18 May, 1546) as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> to <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>. The Dogma of Justification was under discussion. The two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at once won the hearts and respect of all; their discourses had to be printed and distributed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Both set out for Bologna (14 March, 1547) with the Council. After serious sickness at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, Salmeron once again took up his council work. The next two years were in great part spent in preaching at Bologna, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. On 4 Oct., 1549, Salmeron and his companions, Le Jay and Canisius, took their doctorate in the <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a>, so that they might, at the urgent invitation of William IV of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, accept chairs in Ingolstadt. Salmeron undertook to interpret the Epistle to the Romans. He held the attention of all by his learning and grace of exposition. Upon the death of Duke William, and at the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, much to the chagrin of the faculty of the Academy of Ingolstadt, Salmeron was returned to <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> (24 Sept., 1550). That year he explained the Gospel of St. Matthew. Next year (1551) he was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to help St. Ignatius in working up the Constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. Other work was in store. He was soon (Feb., 1551) sent down to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> to inaugurate the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society's</a> first college there, but after a few months was summoned by Ignatius to go back to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> to <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>. It was during the discussions preliminary to these sessions that Lainez and Salmeron, as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, gave their vota first. When the Council once again suspended its sessions, Salmeron returned to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (Oct., 1552). <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> sent him to the Augsburg Diet (May, 1555) with the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, <a href="../cathen/09279a.htm">Lippomanus</a>, and thence into <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; and later (April, 1556) to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Another journey to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> was undertaken in the capacity of adviser to Cardinal Caraffa (2 Dec., 1557). Lainez appointed Salmeron first Provincial of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (1558), and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (1561) during the former's apostolic legation to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> was again resumed (May, 1562) and a third pontiff, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, chose Salmeron and Lainez for <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. The r&ocirc;le was very delicate; the Divine origin of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was the be discussed. During the years 1564-82, Salmeron was engaged chiefly in preaching and writing; he preached every day during eighteen <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten seasons</a>; his preaching was fervent, learned, and fruitful. His writings during this long period were voluminous; <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> spent five months in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> reviewing them. Each day he pointed out to Salmeron the portions that were not up to the mark, and the next day the latter brought back those parts corrected.

<p>The chief writings of Salmeron are his sixteen volumes of Scriptural commentaries--eleven on the Gospels, one on the Acts, and four on the Pauline Epistles. <a href="../cathen/02191c.htm">Southwell</a> says that these sixteen volumes were printed by Sanchez, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, from 1597 till 1602; in <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, 1601; in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, from 1602-04, Sommervogel (Biblioth&egrave;que de la C. de J., VII, 479) has traced only twelve tomes of the <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> edition--the eleven of the Gospels and one of the Pauline commentaries. The Gospel volumes are entitled, "Alfonsi Salmeronis Toletani, e Societate Jusu Theologi, Commentarii in Evangelicam Historiam et in Acta Apostolorum, in duodecim tomos distributi" (Madrid, 1598-1601). The first Cologne edition, together with the second (1612-15), are found complete. These voluminous commentaries are the popular and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> expositions which Salmeron had delivered during his preaching and teaching days. In old age, he gathered his notes together, revised them, and left his volumes ready for posthumous publication by Bartholomew P&eacute;rez de Nueros. Grisar (Jacobi Lainez Disputationes Tridentinae, I, 53) thinks that the commentary on Acts is the work of Perez; Braunsberger (Canisii epist., III, 448) and the editors of "Monumenta Historica S.J." (Epistolae Salmeron, I, xxx) disagree with Grisar. The critical acumen of Salmeron, his judicious study of the Fathers and his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> make his <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">Scriptural exegesis</a> still worth the attention of students. He was noted for his devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and magnanimity. The Acts of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> show that he wielded tremendous influence there by his vota on justification, <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, penance, <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, matrimony and the origin of episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>--all most important questions because of the gradual infiltration of some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> into a small minority of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of that time.
