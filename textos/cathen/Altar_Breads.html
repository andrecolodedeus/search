<h1>Altar Breads</h1>  

<p>Bread is one of the two elements absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">sacrifice of the Eucharist</a>. It cannot be determined from the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a> whether <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> used the ordinary table bread or some other bread specially prepared for the occasion. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> the altar-breads were probably round in form. Archaeological researches demonstrate this from pictures found in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Pope St. Zephyrinus</a> (A.D. 201-219) calls the altar-bread "coronam sive oblatam sphericae figurae". In the Eastern churches they are round or square. Formerly the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> presented the flour from which the breads were formed. In the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> the breads were made by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> virgins; in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, De Sacrif. Missae, I, section 36). This custom is still in vogue in the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The earliest documentary evidence that the altar-breads were made in thin wafers is the answer which Cardinal Humbert, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">St. Leo IX</a>, made at the middle of the eleventh century to <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael Cerularius</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. These wafers were sometimes very large, as from them small pieces were broken for the Communion of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, hence the word "particle" for the small host; but smaller ones were used when only the celebrant communicated.

<p>For <em>valid</em> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the hosts must be: <ul><li>made of wheaten flour, <li>mixed with pure natural water, <li>baked in an oven, or between two heated iron moulds, and <li>they must not be corrupted (Miss. Rom., De Defectibus, III, 1).</ul> If the host is not made of wheaten flour, or is mixed with flour of another kind in such quantity that it cannot be called wheat bread, it may not be used (ibid.). If not natural but distilled water is used, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> becomes of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> validity (ibid., 2). If the host begins to be corrupt, it would be a grievous offence to use it, but it is considered valid matter (ibid., 3.) For <em>licit</em> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>: <ul><li>the bread must be, at present <em>unleavened</em> in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, but <em>leavened</em> bread in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, except among the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, and in the Churches of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Alexandria, where it is unleavened. It is probable that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> used unleavened bread at the institution of the Blessed Eucharist, because the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were not allowed to have leavened bread in their houses on the days of the <a href="../cathen/02171a.htm">Azymes</a>. Some authors are of the opinion that down to the tenth century both the Eastern and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Churches</a> used leavened bread; others maintain that unleavened bread was used from the beginning in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>; still others hold that unleavened or leavened bread was used indifferently. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (IV, Dist. xi, qu. 3) holds that, in the beginning, both in the East and West unleavened bread was used; that when the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a> arose, who wished that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> should be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on all converts, leavened bread was used, and when this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> ceased the Latins used again unleavened bread, but the Greeks retained the use of leavened bread. Leavened bread may be used in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> if after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the celebrant adverts to the fact that the host before him has some substantial defect, and no other than leavened bread can be procured at the time (Lehmkuhl, n. 121, 3). A Latin <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> travelling in the East, in places in which there are no churches of his rite, may celebrate with leavened bread. A Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> travelling in the West may, under similar circumstances, celebrate with unleavened bread. For the purpose of giving <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, if no unleavened bread be at hand, some say that leavened may be used; but St. Liguori, (bk. VI. n. 203, dub. 2) says that the more probable opinion of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> is that it cannot be done. <li>The hosts must be recently made (Rit. Rom., tit. iv, cap. i, n. 7). The <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> do not specify the term <em>recentes</em> in speaking of the hosts. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the bakers of altar-breads are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make solemn affidavit that they will not sell breads older than fifteen days, and St. Charles, by a statute of the Fourth Synod of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, prescribed that hosts older than twenty days must not be used in the celebration of Mass. In practice, therefore, those older than three weeks ought not to be used. <li>Round in form, and not broken. <li>Clean and fair, of a thin layer, and of a size conformable to the regular custom in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the large hosts are about three and one-fifth inches in diameter; in other places they are smaller, but should be at least two and three-fourths inches in diameter. The small hosts for the Communion of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> should be about one and two-fifths inches in diameter (Schober, S. Alphonsi Liber de Caeremoniis Missae, p. 6, footnote 9). When a large host can not be obtained Mass may be said in private with a small host. In cases of necessity, such as permitting the people to fulfil the precept of hearing <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, or administering <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, the Mass may be also said with a small host but, as <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> say, to avoid <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> the faithful should be advised. </ul> As a rule the image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> crucified should be impressed on the large host (Cong. Sac. Rit., 6 April, 1834), but the monogram of the Holy Name (Ephem. Lit., XIII, 1899, p. 686), or the Sacred Heart (ibid., p. 266) may also be adopted.

<p>The altar-breads assumed different names according as they had reference to the Eucharist as a sacrament or as a sacrifice: bread, gift (<em>donum</em>), table (<em>mensa</em>) allude to the Sacrament, which was instituted for the nourishment of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; oblation victim, host, allude to sacrifice. Before the tenth century the word "host" was not employed, probably because before this time the Blessed Eucharist was considered more frequently as a sacrament than as a sacrifice, hence the Fathers use such expressions as communion (<em>synaxis</em>), supper (<em>coena</em>), breaking of bread, etc., but at present the word "host" is used when referring to the Eucharist either as a sacrament or as a sacrifice. In the liturgy it is used: <ul><li>for the bread before its <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, "Suscipe sancte Pater . . . hanc immaculatam hostiam" (<a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> of the Mass); <li>for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> under the appearance of the Eucharistic Species, "Unde et memores . . . hostiam puram, hostiam sanctam, hostiam immaculatam" (Mass, after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>).</ul> Durandus says that the word <em>host</em> is of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> origin, derived from the word <em>hostio</em>, to strike, referring to the victim offered to the gods after a victory, but it is also of biblical origin, as it represented the matter, or victim, of the sacrifice, e.g. "expiationis hostiam" (<a href="../bible/exo029.htm#vrs36">Exodus 29:36</a>).
