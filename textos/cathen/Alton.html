<h1>Alton</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of Alton includes that part of Illinois lying south of the northern limits of the counties of Adams, Brown, Cass, Menard, Sangamon, <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, Moultrie, Douglas, and Edgar, and north of the southern limits of the counties of Madison, Bond, Fayette, Effingham, Jasper, and Crawford. It was created, 29 July, 1853, by the division of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, then embracing the whole state of Illinois. The new see was first located at Quincy, but was transferred, 9 January, 1857, to Alton. Its German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population came largely from <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> and settled at Quincy, Teutopolis, and Germantown. <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> founded Highland, and Alsatians Sainte Marie. The building of railroads brought <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in growing numbers. Cahokia, Kaskaskia, and Prairie du Rocher, which now belong to the <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Diocese of Belleville</a>, had been settled by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at an earlier period. Prominent among the lay <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the early period were Peter and Sebastian Wise of Alton, Mr. Shepherd of Jerseyville, Mr. Picquet of Sainte Marie, Charles Routt and his nephew of Jacksonville. Fathers Ostrop, Hinsen and Hickey were energetic missionaries.
<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>Henry Damian Juncker (1857-68), b. 22 August, 1809, at Fenestrange, in German Lorraine; d. at Alton, 2 October, 1868, attended the Pont-a-Mousson Seminary, but <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, where he found an opportunity of continuing his studies in view of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to which he was raised, 16 March, 1836, by <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell</a>. He filled several charges in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> previous to his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> Cathedral, 26 April, 1854 by <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a>. At Alton the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> found before him 58 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, five in course of erection; 30 stations visited by 28 priests; six young men studying for the ministry; two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> academies, and a population of about 50,000. This population was made up of old French settlers, some Kentuckians, but especially of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants driven away from their country by famine, and Germans, by political disturbances. In Illinois they were finding fertile prairie to till, and railroads to build. Thus they enhanced the prosperity of the State, hitherto only partly cultivated, and depending on the rivers and county roads for its means of communication. The non-Catholic population was not particularly hostile. Priests were very scarce, and vocations to the ministry very limited. In such an emergency the Bishop could only look up to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for help. In the fall of the same year he crossed the ocean and secured followers in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. After his return, he enlarged his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, erected the present Bishop's House, encouraged the building of churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and academies. He attended the Second Plenary Council and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1867) for the Centenary of the Holy Apostles. His subsequent missionary labours brought on a severe sickness, which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> fatal. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in a vault under his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He was succeeded by one of his vicars-general, the Very Rev. Peter Joseph Baltes (1869-86), elected 24 September, 1869, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 23 January, 1870, in the present Belleville Cathedral (built by him), by Bishop Luers, of <a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Fort Wayne</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> was in session. He was born, 7 April, 1820, in Ensheim, Rhenish <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. At the age of six years he <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to Oswego, N.Y. He attended <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Holy Cross College, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Mass.; St. Mary's of the Lake, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>; and the Grand Seminary of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, where he received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, 21 May, 1853. His missionary charge were Waterloo and <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a>. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1866) he was made <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> to Bishop Juncker. Bishop Baltes soon made himself felt by the indomitable energy with which he introduced order and uniformity in matters of liturgy and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>. Under his administration was enacted the special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> under which most of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> is held in Southern Illinois. The burning, in the early part of 1884, of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> built by him while in <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a>, in which twenty-seven lives were lost, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a severe shock to his constitution. Sickness prevented him from attending the Third Plenary Council. He lingered for several months, going to his reward, 15 February, 1886. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> side by side with his predecessor. After a vacancy of more than two years, the Rev. James Ryan, then <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Columba's church, <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/11661b.htm">Peoria</a>, was appointed, 27 February, 1888. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was divided, the southern half being made into the new diocese of <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a>. Bishop Ryan was born near Thurles, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 17 June, 1848. When seven years old, he <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, Ky., studied at St. Thomas's and St. Joseph's Colleges, Bardstown, in that State, finished his studies at Preston Park Seminary, <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, 24 December, 1871. After a few years of mission labours and teaching, he followed Bishop Spalding to <a href="../cathen/11661b.htm">Peoria</a>, laboured on several missions and built a number of churches. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 1 May, 1888, at the Alton Cathedral, by Bishop Spalding. He held the first synod of the Alton Diocese, 27 February, 1889.
