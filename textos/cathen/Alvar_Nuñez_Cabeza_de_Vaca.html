<h1>Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca</h1>  

<p>Born at Jerez de la Frontera in <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> of birth and death uncertain.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were originally peasants and called themselves <em>Alhaja</em> until after the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (11 July, 1212), when they were ennobled for service that contributed to the important victory which the kings of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, and Navarre achieved over the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. One of the Alhajas informed the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of a mountain pass by which the position of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> could be turned, and indicated the entrance by placing the skull of a cow near it. Hence the change of name and the <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a>.

<p>Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez joined the expedition of P&aacute;mfilo de Narvaez to Florida in 1526 as treasurer. With two other <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and an <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moor</a>, he was the only survivor who remained on the mainland. For eight years they roamed along the coasts of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> and <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> under the greatest of hardships, their position among the Indians being wellnigh intolerable. In utter despair, Cabeza de Vaca at last tried his scanty <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of medicine and, his cures proving successful, he became a renowned medicine man among the natives, his companions following the example. The treatment to which they resorted partook of the nature of a faith-cure. He declares the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> to be a seldom-failing remedy. The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the outcasts in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> was sincere, while acknowledging that they also employed indigenous Indian remedies with simple <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> religious ceremonials. After nine years they reached the Pacific coast in <a href="../cathen/14145a.htm">Sonora</a>, Mexico, thus being the first <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> to travel across the North American continent. Cabeza de Vaca arrived at the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">city of Mexico</a> in 1536. He was also the first <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> who saw and described the American bison or buffalo. But the wanderers did not, as had been supposed, see the New Mexican pueblos. They only heard of them.

<p>Returning to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1537, he obtained the post of Governor of the La Plata regions (Argentina), whither he went in 1541. Cabeza de Vaca was a trustworthy subaltern, but not fit for independent command. His men rebelled against him in 1543, took him <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and sent him to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where for eight years he was kept in mild captivity. The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death is not known, but it is stated that he ended his days at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, where he occupied an honourable and modestly lucrative position in connection with the American trade.

<p>He wrote two works. One is the story of his first trials in America as a member of the expedition of Narvaez, which was published at Zamora in 1542, and is known under the title of <em>Naufragios</em> (reprinted 1555 and several times translated into English); the other is on his career in South America (published 1555) and called <em>Comentarios</em>. Both are valuable for the history of Spanish colonization, the former also for the customs and manners of <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">North American Indians</a>.

<p>There is hardly a work on the history of North America extant that does not allude, more or less correctly, to Cabeza de Vaca, and the same may be stated in regard to histories of <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentina</a> and Paraguay. The earliest publications are of course those written by himself, his <em>La Relacion que dio Aluar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca de lo acaescido en las Indians en la armada donde yua por gouernador Pamphilo de Narbaez</em> etc. (Zamora, 1542), only two copies of which are known to exist, and <em>La Relacion y comentarios del gouernador Aluar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca</em> (Valladolid, 1555).

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">OVIEDO, Hist. general y natural (Madrid, 1850), gives the text of the above with some modifications, adding a communication written while on the way to Europe. In Documentos in&eacute;ditos de Indias, there are a few more documents; RAMUSIO, Delle Navigazioni e Viaggi (Venice, 1556), an Italian version. There is a French translation by TERNAUX COMPANS, both of the Naufrages and the Commentaires. English translations: PURCHAS, His Pilgramage (London 1625-26, title, Relation of the Fleet in India, whereof Pamphilus Naruaez was Governor); SMITH, tr. (Washington, 1851): reprinted by John Gilmary Shea (New York, 1871). A paraphrase of the work has been given by KINGSLEY, Tales of Old Travels (London, 1869). FANNY BANDELIER has published the journey of Alvar Nu&ntilde;ez Cabeza de Vaca (New York, 1905), a translation of the 1542 edition of the Naufragios.</p></div>
