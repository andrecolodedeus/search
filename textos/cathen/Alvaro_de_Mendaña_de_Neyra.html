<h1>Alvaro de Menda&ntilde;a de Neyra</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> navigator and explorer, born in <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, 1541; died in Santa Cruz, <a href="../cathen/14138b.htm">Solomon Islands</a>, 18 October, 1596.

<p>Little is known of his early years, but about 1558 he went to <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> upon invitation of his uncle, Lope Garc&iacute;a de Castro, who was then Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. At that time the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> were well aware that the Pacific offered an extensive field for exploration and discovery, and Garc&iacute;a de Castro, wishing to explore that vast region, equipped an expedition of two ships at the head of which he placed his nephew Menda&ntilde;a. The expedition set out from Callao in November, 1567. In the course of about a year they discovered several islands of Oceanica, and returned to <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> in 1568. Menda&ntilde;a's travels did not awaken much interest at first, so he gave an elaborate and glowing description of the archipelago to which he gave the name of Solomon Islands, as it was supposed that here King Solomon had obtained the gold with which he had adorned the temple at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. These reports of the wealth of the islands, some years later, caused the fitting out of a second expedition for the purpose of colonizing them. By order of Philip II, Menda&ntilde;a was placed in command, and the expedition sailed 11 April, 1595. Several groups of islands were discovered, among them the Marquesas Islands which he so named in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the wife of Garc&iacute;a de Mendoza, Marquis of Ca&ntilde;ete, who was at the time Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. The explorer Cook, in 1774, gave the name of Nukahiva to this group, that being the native name of the largest island of the archipelago. The expedition continued westward, visiting several other groups of islands, but Menda&ntilde;a died before he reached the end of the voyage. Before his death, he delegated his powers to his wife in whom he had great confidence and who was with him on the voyage. The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, a very resolute <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, took charge, and led the expedition into <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, where they arrived safely in February, 1596. Menda&ntilde;a left notes describing both of his voyages which were collected after his death by the historian Pedro Gu&eacute;rico de Victoria under the title of "Derrotero de Menda&ntilde;a de Neyra". The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is now in the National Library in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.
