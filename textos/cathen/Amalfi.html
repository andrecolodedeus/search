<h1>Amalfi</h1>  

<p>The Archdiocese of Amalfi, directly dependent on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, has its seat at Amalfi, not far from <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. This was a populous city between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. An independent republic from the seventh century until 1075, it rivalled <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> in its domestic prosperity and maritime importance. A prey to the Normans who encamped in the south of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, it became one of their principal posts. The Emperor Lothair, fighting in favour of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Pope Innocent II</a> against King Roger of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, who sided with the <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Antipope Anacletus</a>, took him <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in 1133, assisted by forty-six Pisan ships. The city was sacked, and Lothair claimed as part of the booty a copy of the <a href="../cathen/11439a.htm">Pandects of Justinian</a> which was found there. But the early beginnings of Amalfi are very obscure; it is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when it was founded, or when <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> reached it. That it was early is a reasonable conjecture, considering the facilities for communication with the East which the South of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> possessed. The first positive indication that Amalfi was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, however, is supplied by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>, who, writing in January, 596, to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">Subdeacon</a> Antemius, his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> and <a href="../cathen/01143a.htm">administrator</a> in Campania, ordered him to constrain within a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> Primenus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Amalfi, because he did not remain in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but roamed about (Reg., V, xiv; cf. Jaff&eacute;, RR.PP., 1403). Amalfi was founded by Primenus in <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 596; the regular list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> began in 829; it was raised to an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> by <a href="../cathen/08427c.htm">John XV</a> in 987. In 1206, after the completion of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Andrew, the body of the <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Apostle of that name</a>, <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of Amalfi, was brought there from Constantinople by Pietro, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, an Amalfian. There are about 36,000 inhabitants, 54 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 279 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. Amalfi occupied a high position in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architecture</a>; its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Sant' Andrea, of the eleventh century, the campanile, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Capuccini, founded by Cardinal Capuanor, richly represent the artistic movement prevailing in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at the time of the Normans, with its tendency to blend the Byzantine style with the forms and sharp lines of the northern architecture.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> culture Amalfi vindicated a worthy place for herself, especially by flourishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and mathematics. Flavio Gioia, who made the first mariner's compasses known to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, is said to be a native of Amalfi. But Gioia was not the inventor of the compass, which was invented in the East and brought to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. In <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Charles II, a Capetian king then ruling <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, Gioia put a fleur-de-lis instead of an N, to indicate the north.
