<h1>Amalricians</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <em>Almarici, Amauriani</em>).

<p>An <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> founded towards the end of the twelfth century, by Amaury de B&#232;ne or de Chartres (Lat., <em>Almaricus, Amalricus, Amauricus</em>), a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> and professor in the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, who died between 1204 and 1207. The Amalricians, like their founder, professed a species of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>, maintaining, as the fundamental principle of their system, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> are one; that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is everything and everything is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This led them, naturally, to the denial of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>, the confounding of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash;since good and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> acts, so called, are equally of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;and to the consequent rejection of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of morality. They held, besides, peculiar views on the Trinity, distinguishing three periods in the Divine economy with regard to man; the reign of the Father, become incarnate in Abraham, which lasted until the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; the reign of the Son, become incarnate in Mary, which had endured until their own time; and the reign of the Holy Ghost, which, taking its beginning from the dawn of the twelfth century, was to last until the end of time. Unlike the Father and the Son, the Holy Ghost was to become incarnate, not merely in one individual of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, but in every member of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Moreover, as the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> had lost its efficacy at the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so, in their day, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Gospel was to be supplanted by the interior guidance of the Holy Ghost, indwelling in each human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In consequence of this they rejected the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as obsolete and useless. Those in whom the Holy Spirit had already taken up His abode were called "the spiritualized", and were supposed to be already enjoying the life of the Resurrection. The signs of this interior illumination were the rejection of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, as tending to keep the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in darkness, and the acceptance, in their place, of the light of positive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. It followed from this, that in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the acquisition of new <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> consisted their <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>; while <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, which meant adherence to the old order of things, was their substitute for <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p>The Amalricians, though including within their ranks many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, succeeded for some time in propogating their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> without being detected by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. At length, through the efforts of Peter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and the Chevalier Gu&eacute;rin, an adviser of the king, to both of whom secret information of the affair had been given, the inner workings of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> were laid bare, and the principals and <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a> were arrested. In the year 1210 a council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> assembled to take measures for the punishment of the offenders. The <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> converts, including many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, were pardoned. Of the principals, four were condemned to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for life. Ten others, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, who had obstinately refused to retract their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, after being publicly degraded, were delivered to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a> and suffered the penalty of death by fire. Five years later (1215) the writings of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, which had been distorted by the sectaries in support of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, were forbidden to be read either in public or in private. Regarding the scope of this prohibition, see <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">U<font size=-2>NIVERSITY OF</font> P<font size=-2>ARIS</font></a>

<p>Amaury himself, though dead some years, did not escape the penalty of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Besides being included in the condemnation of his disciples, in the council of 1210 special sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was pronounced against him, and his bones were exhumed from their resting-place and cast into unconsecrated ground. His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was again condemned by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215) "as insanity rather than heresy", and Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> condemned (1225) the work of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Erigena, "De Divisione Natur&aelig;", from which Amaury was supposed to have derived the beginnings of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.
