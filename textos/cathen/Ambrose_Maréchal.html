<h1>Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal</h1>  

<p>The third <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>; born at Ingres near <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 28 August, 1764; died at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 29 January, 1828. Yielding to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> desires he studied for the legal profession, but later entered the Sulpician <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, where he received <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> towards the close of 1787. Owing to the chaotic condition of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1792. On the day of his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and at the risk of his life, accompanied by Abb&eacute;s Richard, Martignon, and Cicquard he sailed for America and arrived at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (24 June, 1792), where he offered his first Mass. He was sent on the mission in St. Mary's County, and later to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> on the eastern shore of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. In 1799, he was teaching <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11335c.htm">St. Mary's College</a>, Baltimore; in 1801 he was on the staff of <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a>, but after a while returned to St. Mary's, which was then in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, of which order he was a member. Civil government having been restored in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, Father Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal was summoned by his superiors to teach at <a href="../cathen/13347b.htm">Saint-Flour</a>, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> and <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. His pupils at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> presented him with the marble altar which now stands in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and Louis XVIII also testified his regard by presenting him with several <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, which also remain in Baltimore Cathedral.

<p>In 1812 he was again teaching in Baltimore; in 1816 he was nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia but at his request the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> was withdrawn; in 1817, on 24 July, he was appointed coadjutor to Archbishop Neale of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and Titular of <a href="../cathen/14283b.htm">Stauropolis</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of appointment had not reached Baltimore when Archbishop Neale died, and the Titular of <a href="../cathen/14283b.htm">Stauropolis</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> by Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, 14 December, 1817. He soon had to face serious dissensions over the claim by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> to a voice in the appointment of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; he tactfully induced his flock to yield, and established the right of the ordinary to make all such appointments. The building of the Cathedral which had been begun under Archbishop Carroll in 1806, was now resumed and completed so that the edifice was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 31 May, 1821. <span class="stiki">Actually, the cathedral was only <em>dedicated</em> in 1821. It would not be consecrated until 24 May 1876.</span> In that year Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on business of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and in connexion with the White Marsh plantation which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> claimed as Diocesan <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but which had been devised to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (17 Feb., 1728), and was claimed by them as <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> to be employed in the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> secured from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in his favour. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">SOCIETY OF JESUS</a>, <em>in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a></em>.) From his "Relatio Status" for 1821-1822 we learn that in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> as they then existed there were 9 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and 117 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, including the <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Archdiocese of Baltimore</a> which had 40 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 52 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 80,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, 1 Sulpician college, 1 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, 1 Convent of St. Vincent of Paul <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>. In 1826 Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal made a journey to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and on his return fell ill. His coadjutor, Rev. James Whitfield, who succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, had not yet been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> when death came. His writings consist almost entirely of letters and documents scholarly in style and are to be found in "The History of the Society of Jesus in North America" by Hughes.
