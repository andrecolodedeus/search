<h1>Ambrosiaster</h1>  

<p>The name given to the author of a commentary on all the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, with the exception of that to the Hebrews. It is usually published among the works of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (P.L., XVII, 45-508). Before each Epistle and its interpretation a short prologue is found which sets forth purpose and context. In the commentaries the text is given by sections; and for each portion a natural and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> explanation is furnished. All in all the commentary is an excellent work. Some modern scholars believe it the best that was written before the sixteenth century. Its teaching is entirely <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, with, perhaps, the sole exception of the author's <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the millennium. The Latin text of the Pauline Epistles differs considerably from the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. According to all appearances it was taken from the version known as the "Itala". Reference to the Greek text is rarely found; in fact the writer seems to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Greek language. The author hardly ever seeks a hidden or mystic sense in the text; hence it becomes evident how widely the commentary differs in character from the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works of St. Ambrose. In his interpretation of Scriptural works St. Ambrose is not much given to research into the natural and literal meaning. Generally he is in quest of a higher allegoric or mystic sense. And although he distinguishes between the literal and the higher signification, still it is the latter principally that he tries to bring out. Not so with Ambrosiaster. The natural and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> sense is the only object the writer has in view. As to the time when the commentary was written, there are many indications which point to the latter part of the fourth century. Of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> or <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> referred to, none antedates that period. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Emperor Julian</a> (361-363) is spoken of as a recent occurrence. Finally Pope Damasus (366-384) is mentioned as actually presiding (<em>hodie</em>) over the destinies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is quite likely that the writer lived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; his reference to the primacy of St. Peter and the power wielded by Pope Damasus would suggest the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. The identification of the writer however is not so easy. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the commentary was commonly ascribed to St. Ambrose. The first <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> as to his authorship were raised by <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> in the sixteenth century; since that period the author has been known as Ambrosiaster (Pseudo-Ambrosius). Scholars have suggested a great variety of names. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, in quoting a passage from the commentary, attributes it to St. Hilary; hence some writers believed the either <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">St. Hilary of Poitiers</a>, or St. Hilary of Pavia, or the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Hilary of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was meant. Others sought the writer in <a href="../cathen/12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/08557b.htm">Julian of Aeclanum</a>, in the African writer <a href="../cathen/14721d.htm">Tyconius</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Faustinus of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or in the converted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> Isaac of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Most of these views are mere conjectures, or directly opposed to the facts known about the writer. The more recent opinion is that the author of the commentaries is also the author of the pseudo-Augustinian "Quaestiones Veteris et Novi Testamenti". According to a suggestion made by Dom Germain Morin, O.S.B., and adopted by A. Souter, the author of these commentaries was a distinguished <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> of consular rank, by the name of Decimus Hilarianus Hilarius.
