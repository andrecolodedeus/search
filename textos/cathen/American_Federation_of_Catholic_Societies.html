<h1>American Federation of Catholic Societies</h1>  

<p>An organization of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> under the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, to protect and advance their religious, civil, and social interests. It does not destroy the autonomy of any <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> or interfere with its activities, but seeks to unite all of them for purposes of co-operation and economy of forces. It is not a political organization, neither does it ask any privileges or favours for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The principal object of the Federation is to encourage (1) the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian education</a> of youth; (2) the correction of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and exposure of falsehood and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; the destruction of bigotry; the placing of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, thus removing the obstacles that have hitherto impeded their progress; (3) the infusion of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> principles into public and social life, by combatting the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> threatening to undermine the foundations of civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, notably <a href="../cathen/14062a.htm">socialism</a>, <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, dishonesty in business, and corruption in politics and positions of public trust. The first organization to inaugurate the movement for a concerted action of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> was the Knights of St. John. At their annual meeting held at <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a> in 1899 they resolved to unite the efforts of their local commanderies. In 1900 at Philadelphia they discussed the question of a federation of all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. As a result a convention was held on 10 Dec., 1901, at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, under the presidency of Mr. H.J. Fries. Two hundred and fifty delegates were present under the guidance of Bishop McFaul of <a href="../cathen/15037a.htm">Trenton</a>, Bishop Messmer of <a href="../cathen/06777a.htm">Green Bay</a>, now <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, the principal factors in the organization of the movement, Archbishop Elder of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, Bishop Horstmann of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, and Bishop Maes of <a href="../cathen/04462b.htm">Covington</a>. A charter bond was framed and the Federation formally established, with Mr. T.B. Minahan as its first president. Since then annual conventions have been held. The Federation represents close to two million <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It has been approved by Popes <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, and practically all the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the country. The fruits of the labours of the organization have been manifold; among other things it has helped to obtain a fair settlement of the disputes concerning the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, permission for the celebration of Mass in the navy-yards, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, reform <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; assistance for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> missions; the withdrawal and prohibition of indecent plays and post-cards. It has prevented the enactment of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> inimical to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests in several state legislatures. One of its chief works has been the uniting of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of different nationalities, and harmonizing their efforts for self-protection and improvement. It publishes a monthly Bulletin, which contains valuable social studies. The national secretary is Mr. Anthony Matr&eacute;, Victoria Building, St. Louis, Missouri.
