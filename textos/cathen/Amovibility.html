<h1>Amovibility</h1>  

<p>A term applied to the condition of certain <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in regard to their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> or offices. While it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that holders of so-called perpetual or irremovable dignities can in certain specified cases be deprived of their offices, yet the term "amovibility" is generally restricted to such as are removable at the will of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Such are most of the rectors of churches in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, as also in general and everywhere those who have charge of succursal churches or are <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> assistants. Under the head of removable dignitaries, canonists generally class also vicars-general, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>, and rural deans. Such an office or <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> is designated <em>manuale</em>, as opposed to <em>titulare</em> or <em>perpetuum</em>. The interpretation of amovibility has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> considerable controversy. Many canonists have argued that because the possessor of an office holds it <em>ad nutum</em>, he can therefore be deprived of it without cause. Otherwise, they declare, the word amovibility would have no meaning. They note as exceptions, however, to this power of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, cases in which he acts from open <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, or injures the good name of the ecclesiastic, or damages the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Likewise, they say, if the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> removed were not given another office, he could have recourse to a superior authority, as this would be equivalent to injuring his good name. These canonists also add that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he removed an ecclesiastic without cause, as his action would be without a proper motive, and because frequent changes are necessarily detrimental to churches. Other canonists seem to maintain for removable rectors (see <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">RECTOR</a>) practically the same <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as to perpetuity, which are possessed by irremovable <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Perhaps, however, the difference between these opinions is little more than verbal. Amovibility must not be confounded with arbitrary removal, which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always condemned. It is opposed rather to the perpetual tenure of those <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, for removal from which the canons require a cause expressly named in law and a formal canonical process or trial. But there may be other very grave causes that justify a removal besides those named in the canons. Nor does it follow that, because a regular canonical process is not to be observed, all formalities are to be neglected in the removal of rectors who hold their office <em>ad nutum episcopi</em>; there are also extra-judicial forms which are practically equivalent to a canonical process.

<p>A removable <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> is, therefore, one who may be removed without cause expressed in law, but not without a just cause; one who may be removed without canonical process, but not without certain prescribed formalities, which are really judicial, though "extra-judicial" as regards the canons. Since, however, removable <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> have no strict and perpetual right to their offices, any revocation made by the superior <em>ad nutum</em> is valid, though it might be gravely illicit and reversible. In such cases recourse may be had to a superior authority, although an ordinary appeal in the strict sense is barred. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the method of procedure is laid down principally in the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1866) and the Roman Instructions "Quamvis" of 1878 and "Cum Magnopere" of 1884.
