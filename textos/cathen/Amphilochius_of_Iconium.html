<h1>Amphilochius of Iconium</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the fourth century, son of a Cappadocian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of distinction, b. perhaps at C&aelig;sarea, c. 339 or 340; d. probably some time between 394 and 403. His father was an eminent lawyer, and his mother Livia remarkable for gentleness and wisdom. He was probably first cousin to <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, and was brought up in the peculiarly religious atmosphere of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> aristocracy of his native province. He studied for the bar, practised at Constantinople, but soon retired to lead a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the vicinity of his friend and relative, the "theologian" of <a href="../cathen/10728c.htm">Nazianzus</a>. He was soon drawn within the circle of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil's</a> influence, and seems to have been for a while a member of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> "City of the Poor" that Basil had built at C&aelig;sarea. Early in 374 he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the important see of <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, probably placed there by Basil, whom he continued to aid in Cappadocian <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs until Basil's death (379). Thenceforth he remained in close relations with <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, and accompanied him to the Synod of Constantinople (381), where <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> met and conversed with him (De Vir. Ill., c. 133). In the history of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> he occupies a place of prominence for his defence of the divinity of the Holy Spirit against the <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonians</a>. It was to him that St. Basil dedicated his work "On the Holy Spirit". He wrote a similar work, now lost. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, that he read it to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> on the occasion of their meeting at Constantinople. His attitude towards <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> is illustrated by the well-known anecdote concerning his audience with <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> and his son Arcadius. When the Emperor rebuked him for ignoring the presence of his son, he reminded him that the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> abhorreth those who are ungrateful towards His Son, their Saviour and Benefactor. He was very energetic against the <a href="../cathen/10212a.htm">Messalians</a>, and contributed to the extirpation of that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. His contemporaries rated him very high as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and a scholarly writer. Not to speak of his admirers and friends already mentioned, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> says (Ep. 70) of the Cappadocian triad (Basil, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory</a>, and Amphilochius) that "they cram their books with the lessons and sentences of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> to such an extent that you cannot tell which you ought to admire most in them, their secular erudition or their scriptural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>". In the next generation Theodoret described him in very flattering terms (<a href="../fathers/27024.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.10</a> and <a href="../fathers/27025.htm">V.16</a>), and he is quoted by councils as late as 787. His only genuine extant work is, according to Bardenhewer (Patrologie, p. 249), the "Epistola Synodica", a letter against the Macedonian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lycaonia, and probably addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lycia (Goldhorn, S. Basil., Opp. Sel. Dogm., 630-635). The spurious "Iambics to Seleucus" offer an early and important catalogue of the canonical writings; other spurious fragments, current under his name, are taken from scriptural discourses, dogmatic letters and controversial writings (P.G., XXXIX, 13-130).</p>
