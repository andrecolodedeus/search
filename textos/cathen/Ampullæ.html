<h1>Ampull&aelig;</h1>  

<p>Among the smaller objects discovered in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> are a number of fragments of vessels ordinarily used for domestic purposes. Some of these fragments are, probably, portions of the drinking Cups used in the celebration of the funeral <em>agape</em>, or banquet, while others again are the remains of vases which contained the unguents that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, often <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> with the dead. A third class of vessels, ordinarily referred to as blood-ampull&aelig;, has been the subject of considerable speculation by arch&aelig;ologists. Portions of these vessels have been found in the cement employed to enclose certain graves in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. Their peculiarity consists in the sediment of dark red colour they contain, from which they derive the name, blood-ampull&aelig;, on the theory that the sediment is the remains of the blood of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. This theory was for a time rather generally accepted, and the presence of a blood-vase was regarded as one of the marks of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. <a href="../cathen/09723b.htm">Martigny</a>, however, in the second edition of his "Dict. des antiquit&eacute;s chr&eacute;tiennes" (Paris, 1877), expressed himself as dissatisfied with the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> put forward by its supporters. Professor Kraus, also, in a work devoted to this subject, pronounced against the unconditional acceptance of the blood theory. The reasons for this conclusion are as follows: <ul><li>the so-called blood-ampull&aelig; have been found on <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the latter half of the fourth century, a time when the era of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was long over; <li>the monogram of Christ, which in practically all cases indicates the age of Constantine, is frequently represented on <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> containing blood-ampull&aelig; <li>a fifth of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> with ampull&aelig; of this class contained the remains of children under seven, and it is difficult to admit that so large a proportion of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were mere infants; <li>a chemical analysis made at Greenwich of the contents of sixty ampull&aelig; has shown that the sediment contains a quantity of oxide of iron twenty, or more, times greater than would have existed in blood.</ul>

<p>These results of later investigation are wholly negative, and the theories advanced in place of that formerly accepted are by no means satisfactory. Kraus regards vessels of this class as having been, as a rule, receptacles for <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>; in six instances, however, he thinks it probable that they contained blood. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> <a href="../cathen/11742b.htm">Victor De Buck</a> conjectures that the wine left after the celebration of Mass was placed in them, but this view is not borne out by the Greenwich analysis. Leclercq concludes his researches in this matter by calling attention to the fact that ampull&aelig; have been found on Jewish <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> fastened in the same way as in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cemeteries, in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> of the Vigna Randanini and the Via Labicana. In relation to this subject two decisions of the Sacred Congregation of Rites are of interest. The first of them, given 10 April, 1668, states that the palm on a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and the blood-vase (<em>vas illorum sanguine tinctum</em>) are evidences of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> grave. The second decision, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 10 December, 1863, is formulated in substantially the same terms (<em>Phial&oelig; . . . . sanguine tinct&oelig;</em>). These decrees require no modification, even at the present time; but it is now <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to determine by chemical analysis whether the content of a vase is really blood or not. The term <em>ampulla</em> was applied also to the vessels of terra-cotta, metal, or glass in which the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a> were kept (Optat. Mil., Contra <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a>., II, 19; <em>ampulla chrismatis</em>). The "Sainte Ampoulle" used at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> was an object of great reverence in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (see <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">REIMS</a>), and was popularly believed to have been brought from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> by a dove at the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> (496). In the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Monza are preserved several of the ampull&aelig; sent to Queen Theodolinda by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a>; they contained oil from the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the most famous Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. This custom of obtaining ampull&aelig; filled with oil from the lamps at the shrines of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> was generally observed in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; those from the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Mennas in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, brought to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, are especially numerous. Ampull&aelig; usually bore the image or symbols of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> from whose <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> the oil was obtained.
