<h1>Amulet</h1>  

<p><em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/01443b.htm">USE AND ABUSE OF AMULETS</a>

<p>(Greek, <em>phylakterion</em><a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <em>amuleta</em>).

<p>An object generally inscribed with mysterious formul&aelig; and used by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> as a protection against various maladies, as well as <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>. Pliny (XXIX, 4,19) is the earliest writer who mentions amulets <em>(veneficiorum amuleta). </em>The derivation of the word is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, but it probably comes from the Arabic <em>hamala, </em>"to carry", amulets being borne on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The Oriental peoples were especially addicted to <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> practices, and with their absorption into the Roman Empire the use of amulets became equally common in the West. Following the example of Moses, who sought to turn the minds of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> emblems to which they were accustomed in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, by substituting for them symbols of an elevating character, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while forbidding amulets, permitted the use of emblems which would remind the bearers of some <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">St. Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/02093.htm"><em>The Pedagogue</em> III.3</a>) recommended the use of such symbols as the fish, the dove, and the anchor on seals and rings. A <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">devotional medal</a> of lead, attributed to the fourth century, represents a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> extended on a gridiron; one of the fifth or sixth century bears the monogram of Christ and a cross between the letters and ; while a third represents the sacrifice of Abraham, and on the reverse a father offering his son before the <em>confessio </em>of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope St. Gregory the Great</a> sent the Lombard queen, Theodolinda, on the occasion of the birth of her son, two <em>phylacteria, </em>one of which contained a fragment of the wood of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>, the other a sentence of the Gospel. The custom of carrying portions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> as <a href="../cathen/12046a.htm">phylacteries</a> is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (St. Jerome, in Matthew 4:24; St. John Chrys., in Matthew hom., 73). But, especially from the fourth century, when imperial favour brought large numbers into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> abuses in the use of devotional emblems became so common that the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> frequently to inveigh against the use of amulets. The Council of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> (latter half of fourth century) prohibited <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> from making amulets and made the penalty for wearing them <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (canon 36). <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, preaching at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, denounced as a species of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> the wearing of amulets, which seems to have been common among his auditors. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> also denounced the numerous charlatans who dispensed charms, and a collection of canons made by St. C&aelig;sarius of Arles (d. 542), formerly supposed to have been canons of the Fourth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, imposed the penalty of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> on those who patronized augurs (can. 89; see Hefele, Conciliengesch., II, 76). From one of the sermons (P.L., XXXIX, 2272) of St. C&aelig;sarius it appears that the dispensing of amulets was a regular profession; each disease had its appropriate amulet. These and similar <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> practices survived to some extent, in one form or another, through the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and their suppression has always been a difficulty with which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has had to cope. The most ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> amulet known, from Beir&ucirc;t, is attributed to the second century. it is made of gold and has a ring by which it was attached to the neck. The inscription on it, which is of more than ordinary interest, reads: "I <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcise</a> thee, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> (O cross purify me) in the name of the Lord the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that thou mayest never leave thy abode. Pronounced in the house of her whom I have anointed". Leclercq sees in this invocation <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> "(1) of belief in the virtue of the sign of the cross to put demons to flight, (2) of the conferring of extreme unction, (3) and of the use of exorcisms", whereof we have here a formula. A favourite <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> amulet in the Orient during the fourth and fifth centuries bore on one side the image of Alexander the Great. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, in one of his Antioch instructions (Ad Illumin., Cat., II, 5), censures the use by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of amulets with the portrait of the Macedonian conqueror. Several amulets of this class, in the Cabinet of Medals at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, show, on one side, Alexander in the character of Hercules, and, on the other, a she-ass with her foal, a scorpion, and the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus Christ</a>. An amulet in the Vatican Library with the picture of Alexander, bears on the reverse the <a href="../cathen/10488a.htm">monogram of Our Lord</a>. Magic nails, also, with inscriptions were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> with the dead; one of them for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> use has the legend "ter dico, ter incanto, in signv Deo et signv Salomonis et signv de nostr&acirc; Art(e) mix". The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> were especially notable for their employment of amulets; the names found most frequently in their invocations are <a href="../cathen/01146a.htm">Adonai</a>, <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">Sabaoth</a>, Jao, Michael, <a href="../cathen/12640b.htm">Raphael</a>, Souriel (Uriel), and Gabriel.
