<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Anastasius Bibliothecarius</h1>  

<p>Librarian of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, b. about 810; d. 879. He was a nephew of Bishop Arsenius of Orta, who executed important commissions as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>. Anastasius learned Greek from Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and obtained an unusual <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for his era, so that he appears to be the most learned ecclesiastic of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the barbaric period of the ninth century. During the reign of <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> (855-67) Anastasius was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Virgin Mary on the farther side of the Tiber (in Trastevere), and he was employed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in various matters. He was also active as an author, and translated Greek works into Latin, one of these being the biography of <a href="../cathen/08486a.htm">St. John the Almsgiver</a>, which he dedicated to <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a>. The successor of <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas</a>, <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> (867-72), appointed Anastasius librarian of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, an important office which gave him much influence at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Court. In 869 he was sent by Emperor Louis II as envoy to Constantinople, with two men of high rank in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire, to negotiate a marriage between the oldest son of the Byzantine emperor and the daughter of the emperor in the West. When the envoys arrived at Constantinople, the Eighth Oecumenical Council was still in session, and Anastasius, who attended the last session (February, 870), <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> defended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> cause and was of much service to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>. On their way home the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> were robbed, and the "Acts" of the council were carried off. However, they had given most of the declarations of obedience of the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to Anastasius, who also had a copy of the "Acts", and was thus able to bring these documents to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> order he translated the "Acts" into Latin. The succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> (872-82), also esteemed Anastasius, confirmed him in the office of librarian, entrusted important affairs to him, and encouraged him to further literary work. Anastasius was in correspondence with the deposed Byzantine patriarch, Photius, and sought to mediate between the patriarch and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and also to assuage the controversy over the Holy Ghost by assuming that the Latins understood the procession (<em>processio</em>) of the Holy Ghost from the Son in the sense of transmission (<em>missio</em>).

<p>If a passage in the annals of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a> is genuine (Mon. Germ. Hist.: Scriptores, I, 447) and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> has not confused two men, then the librarian Anastasius is identical with the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Anastasius who in 874 became titular <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Marcellus, and in 848 fled from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and resided in various cities. On account of his flight he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by a Roman synod in 850, and, as he did not return, was <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> and deposed by another synod in 853. After the death of <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> in 855 this Anastasius was elected as <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> by the imperial party, but the rightfully elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/02427e.htm">Benedict III</a>, gained the supremacy, and acted kindly towards the usurper. During the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> Anastasius became involved in serious difficulties, in 868 a near relative of his named Eleutherius forcibly carried off the daughter of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and soon after killed both her and her mother. The murderer was executed and Anastasius, who was regarded as the instigator of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, was punished by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and deposition. He lived at the imperial Court, and sought by the intervention of the emperor to exculpate himself before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> (Photius, II, 230-240) maintains, with good reason, that the librarian and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Anastasius (the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>) were one and the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and weaves all the statements concerning the latter into the biography of Anastasius, while Langen (Geschichte der r&ouml;mischen Kirche, III, 270 sqq.) considers them different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. In August, 879, Zacharias of <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a> appears as librarian of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, so that Anastasius must have died shortly before this date.

<p>Anastasius translated from Greek into Latin the "Acts" of the Seventh and Eighth Ecumenical Councils, as well as several legends of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and other writings. He also compiled a historical work, "Chronographia tripartita", from the Greek writings of <a href="../cathen/14623a.htm">Theophanes</a>, Nicephorus, and <a href="../cathen/06463a.htm">Syncellus</a>, and made a collection of documents concerning the affairs of Pope Honorius. Several important letters written by him have been preserved. His writings are to be found in P.G., XXIX; P.L., LXXIII, CXXII, CXXIX. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, which was formerly ascribed to him, was not written by him; he seems to have shared in the revision of the "Life" of <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a>.
