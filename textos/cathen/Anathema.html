<h1>Anathema</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>anathema</em> &#151; literally, placed on high, suspended, set aside).

<p>A term formerly indicating offerings made to the divinity which were suspended from the roof or walls of <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> for the purpose of being exposed to view. Thus <em>anathema</em> according to its etymology signifies a thing offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The word <em>anathema</em> is sometimes used in this sense in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>: In <a href="../bible/jth016.htm#vrs23">Judith 16:23</a>, it is said that Judith, having taken all the arms of Holofernes which the people had given him and the curtain of his bed which she herself had brought, offered them to the Lord as an anathema of oblivion. In II Mach., ix, 16, Antiochus promises to adorn with precious gifts (anathemata) the temple he has pillaged; and in <a href="../bible/luk021.htm#vrs5">Luke 21:5</a>, mention is made of the temple built of precious stones and adorned with rich gifts (anathemata). As odious objects were also exposed to view, e.g. the head of a criminal or of an enemy, or his arms or spoils, the word <em>anathema</em> came to signify a thing <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, or execrable, devoted to public abhorrence or destruction. "To understand the word anathema", says Vigouroux, "we should first go back to the real meaning of <em>herem</em> of which it is the equivalent. <em>Herem</em> comes from the word <em>haram,</em> to cut off, to separate, to curse, and indicates that which is cursed and condemned to be cut off or exterminated, whether a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or a thing, and in consequence, that which man is forbidden to make use of." This is the sense of anathema in the following passage from <a href="../bible/deu007.htm#vrs26">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>: "Neither shalt thou bring anything of the idol into thy house, lest thou become an anathema like it. Thou shalt detest it as dung, and shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth, because it is an anathema." Nations, <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, animals, and inanimate objects may become anathema, i.e. cursed and devoted to destruction. It was thus that the people inhabiting the Promised Land were anathematized as Moses says (<a href="../bible/deu007.htm#vrs1">Deuteronomy 7:1, 2</a>): "When . . . the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> shall have delivered them to thee, thou shalt utterly destroy them." When a people was anathematized by the Lord, they were to be entirely exterminated. Saul was rejected by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for having spared Agag, King of the Amalecites, amid the greater part of the booty (<a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#vrs9">1 Samuel 15:9-23</a>). Anyone who spared anything belonging to a man who had been declared anathema, became himself anathema. There is the story of Achan who had charge of the spoils of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>: "The anathema is in the midst of thee, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: thou canst not stand before thy enemies till he be destroyed out of thee that is defiled with this wickedness." Achan, with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> amid herds, was stoned to death. Sometimes it is cities that are anathematized. When the anathema is rigorous all the inhabitants are to be exterminated, the city burned, and permission denied ever to rebuild it, and its riches offered to <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a>. This was the fate of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> (<a href="../bible/jos006.htm#vrs17">Joshua 6:17</a>). If it is less strict, all the inhabitants are to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, but the herds may be divided among the victors (<a href="../bible/jos008.htm#vrs27">Joshua 8:27</a>). The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of killing all inhabitants occasionally admits of exceptions in the case of young girls who remain captives in the hands of the conquerors (<a href="../bible/num031.htm#vrs18">Numbers 31:18</a>). The severity of the anathema in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is explained by the necessity there was of preserving the Jewish people and protecting them against the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> professed by the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> anathema no longer entails death, but the loss of goods or exclusion from the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> frequently uses this word in the latter sense. In the Epistle to the Romans (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#vrs3">9:3</a>) he says: "For I wished myself to be an anathema from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for my brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh", i.e. "I should wish to be separated and rejected of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if by that means I would procure the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of my brethren." And again, using the word in the same sense, he says (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs9">Galatians 1:9</a>): "If any one preach to you a gospel besides that which you have received, let him be anathema." But he who is separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is united to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, which explains why <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, instead of anathematizing, sometimes delivers a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> over to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs20">1 Timothy 1:20</a>; <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#vrs5">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>). Anathema signifies also to be overwhelmed with maledictions, as in <a href="../bible/1co016.htm#vrs22">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>: "If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, let him be anathema." At an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> adopted the word <em>anathema</em> to signify the exclusion of a sinner from the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the faithful; but the anathema was pronounced chiefly against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. All the councils, from the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> to that of the Vatican, have worded their dogmatic canons: "If any one says . . . let him be anathema". Nevertheless, although during the first centuries the anathema did not seem to differ from the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, beginning with the sixth century a distinction was made between the two. A Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> desires that after three warnings there be recited in chorus Psalm cviii against the usurper of the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that he may fall into the curse of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, and "that he may be not only <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, but anathematized, and that he may be stricken by the sword of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>". This distinction was introduced into the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the letter of <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> (872-82) found in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of Gratian (c. III, q. V, c. XII): "Know that Engeltrude is not only under the ban of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, which separates her from the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the brethren, but under the anathema, which separates from the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." This distinction is found in the earliest <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, in the chapter <em>Cum non ab homine.</em> In the same chapter, the tenth of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> II, tit. i, <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> (1191-98), speaking of the measures it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to take in proceeding against a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> guilty of theft, homicide, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, or other crimes, says: "If, after having been deposed from office, he is incorrigible, he should first be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>; but if he perseveres in his <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a> he should be stricken with the sword of anathema; but if plunging to the depths of the abyss, he reaches the point where he despises these penalties, he should be given over to the secular arm." At a late period, <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> (1227-41), bk. V, tit. xxxix, ch. lix, <em>Si quem,</em> distinguishes minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, or that implying exclusion only from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, from major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, implying exclusion from the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. He declares that it is major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> which is meant in all texts in which mention is made of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Since that time there has been no difference between major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and anathema, except the greater or less degree of <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> in pronouncing the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p>Anathema remains a major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> which is to be <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> with great solemnity. A formula for this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was drawn up by Pope Zachary (741-52) in the chapter <em>Debent duodecim sacerdotes,</em> Cause xi, quest. iii. The Roman Pontifical reproduces it in the chapter <em>Ordo excommunicandi et absolvendi,</em> distinguishing three sorts of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>: minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, formerly incurred by a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> holding communication with anyone under the ban of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, pronounced by the Pope in reading a sentence; and anathema, or the penalty incurred by crimes of the gravest order, and solemnly <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. In passing this sentence, the pontiff is vested in <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, stole, and a violet cope, wearing his <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, and assisted by twelve <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> clad in their <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplices</a> and holding lighted candles. He takes his seat in front of the altar or in some other suitable place, amid pronounces the formula of anathema which ends with these words: "Wherefore in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the All-powerful, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, of the Blessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles, and of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in virtue of the power which has been given us of binding and loosing in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and on earth, we deprive N-- himself and all his accomplices and all his abettors of the <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Communion of the Body and Blood of Our Lord</a>, we separate him from the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, we exclude him from the bosom of our Holy Mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and on earth, we declare him <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and anathematized and we judge him condemned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> with <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">angels</a> and all the reprobate, so long as he will not burst the fetters of the demon, do penance and satisfy the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; we deliver him to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to mortify his body, that his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be saved on the day of judgment." Whereupon all the assistants respond: "Fiat, fiat, fiat." The pontiff and the twelve <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> then cast to the ground the lighted candles they have been carrying, and notice is sent in writing to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the name of the one who has been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and the cause of his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, in order that they may have no communication with him. Although he is delivered to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">angels</a>, he can still, and is even bound to repent. The Pontifical gives the form for absolving him and reconciling him with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the anathema with such solemnity is well calculated to strike terror to the criminal and bring him to a state of repentance, especially if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> adds to it the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the Maranatha.

<p>At the end of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, xvi, 22, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says, "If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, let him be anathema, maranatha," which means, "The Lord is come." But commentators have regarded this expression as a formula of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> very severe among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. This opinion, however, is not sustained by Vigouroux, "Dict. de la Bible" (s.v. <em>Anath&egrave;me).</em> In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, Maranatha has become a very solemn formula as anathema, by which the criminal is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, abandoned to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and rejected from the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> until the coming of the Lord. An example of such an anathema is found in these words of Pope Silverius (536-38): "If anyone henceforth deceives a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in such a manner, let him be anathema maranatha before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">holy angels</a>." <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1740-58--De Synodo dioecesana X, i) cites the anathema maranatha formulated by the Fathers of the Fourth Council of Toledo against those who were guilty of the crime of high treason: "He who dares to despise our decision, let him be stricken with anathema maranatha, i.e. may he be damned at the coming of the Lord, may he have his place with <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, he and his companions. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." There is frequent mention of this anathema maranatha in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of erection for <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and other establishments. Still the anathema maranatha is a censure from which the criminal may be absolved; although he is delivered to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">angels</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in virtue of the Power of the Keys, can receive him once more into the communion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. More than that, it is with this purpose in view that she takes such rigorous measures against him, in order that by the <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> of his body his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be saved on the last day. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, animated by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">spirit of God</a>, does not wish the death of the sinner, but rather that he be converted and live. This explains why the most severe and terrifying formulas of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, containing all the rigours of the Maranatha have, as a rule, clauses like this: Unless he becomes repentant, or gives satisfaction, or is corrected.
