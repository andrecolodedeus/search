<h1>Ancient Diocese and Monastery of Lindisfarne</h1>  

<p>(Lindisfarnensis).

<p>The island of Lindisfarne lies some two miles off the Northumberland coast, nine and one-half miles southeast of the border-town of Berwick. Its length is about three miles and its breadth about one and one-half. At low water it is joined to the mainland. Twice each day it is accessible by means of a three-mile track from Beal across the sands. The wet and splashy road is indicated by wooden posts. This island is now usually called Holy Island, a designation dating back to the eleventh century. Lindisfarne is famous for being the mother-church and religious capital of Northumbria, for here <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a>, a Columban monk-bishop from <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, founded his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 635. The resemblance of Lindisfarne to the island whence <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a> came has obtained for it the title of the <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Aidan's mission was started at the request of King Oswald, who had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the Celtic <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and who then resided on the mainland at the royal fortress of Bamborough. Holy Isle became the center of great missionary activity and also the episcopal seat of sixteen successive <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The influence of these spiritual leaders was considerable, owing in great measure to the patronage afforded by kings such as St. Oswald. Not only did <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a> fix his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> here, but he also established a monastic community, thus conforming himself, as <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> says, to the practice of St. Augustine at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> (Hist. eccl., IV, xxvii). From this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> were founded all the churches between Edinburgh and the Humber, as well as several others in the great midland district and in the country of the East Angles. Among the holy and famous men <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in Lindisfarne were <a href="../cathen/03470c.htm">St. Ceadda</a> (Chad) of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a> and his brothers Cedd, Cynibill, Caelin, also <a href="../cathen/05325a.htm">St. Egbert</a>, St. Edilhun, St. Ethelwin, St. Oswy the King, and the four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Middle Angles: Diuma, Cellach, Trumhere, and Jaruman. Bishop Eata was one of the native Northumbrian boys whom Aidan had taken to Lindisfarne "to be instructed in Christ". <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">St. Adamnan</a> visited the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> received his early training there. The original buildings were probably of wood. We gain some notion of their unpretending character from the fact that <a href="../cathen/06075c.htm">St. Finan</a>, Aidan's successor, found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to reconstruct the church so as to make it more worthy of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. This he did after the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> fashion, using hewn oak with a roof of reeds. A later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Eadbert, removed the reeds and substituted sheets of lead. This modest structure was dedicated by <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Peter, and within it, on the right side of the altar, reposed the body of <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a>. Portions of this primitive <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> existed in 1082, when they disappeared to make room for a more elaborate and lasting edifice. Owing probably to a desire to guard against irregularities, such as had taken place at Coldingham, entrance to the church was not permitted to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. For the latter a special church was provided, called the Green Church form its situation in a green meadow. This exclusion of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was for a time observed at <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>.

<p>Lindisfarne owes much of its glory to <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>, who ruled its church for two years, and whose incorrupt body was there <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> during two centuries. In 793 the Danes invaded the island, pillaged the church, and slaughtered or drowned the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In 875 they returned, bent on further destruction, but the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had fled, bearing with them <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a> shrine. This took place during the episcopate of Bishop Eardulf, who was the last to rule the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Lindisfarne. The half ruined church, however, gave temporary shelter to the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> at the time when William the Conqueror was engaged in subduing Northumbria, but the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was never re-established there. It was fixed for a time at Chester-le-Street by Eardulf, and in 995 transferred to Durham. Here it remained till the change of religion in the sixteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> succession, however, still continues. When the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was restored to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1850, this venerable <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was refounded under the title of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham and Newcastle</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ruins on Holy Island date from the eleventh century. By a charter of 1082 Bishop Carileph bestowed the church of Lindisfarne on the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, whom he had brought to Durham from <a href="../cathen/15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a> and Jarrow; and for them he began the Norman church the remains of which still exist. His successor, Bishop Flambard, completed the work, the architect being a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> named "XX"dward. The succession of <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was always appointed by the mother-church of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, and their yearly accounts were rendered to the same parent-house. From these statements, still extant, we gather that in its best days the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> income was equal to about 1200 pounds of present money. During the priorate of Thomas Sparke (1536) the house was dissolved, and at his death, in 1571, the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> passed into the hands of the Dean and Chapter of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>. Since 1613 the site of the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> has belonged to the crown. The church, under the invocation of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>, was a copy of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> on a small scale. The similarity is especially observable in the voluted and chevroned columns of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>. Its length was 150 feet. The tower was still standing in 1728. A <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, consisting of 3000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, crossed the sands to Holy Island in 1887 &#151; the twelfth centenary of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a> death. The following is a list of the Bishops of Lindisfarne, with dates of accession: <ol><li><a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">Aidan</a>, 635; <li>Finan, 652; <li>Colman, 661; <li>Tuda, 664; <br>(For fourteen years Lindisfarne was included in Diocese of York under Chad and Wilfrid.) <li>Eata, 678; <li>Cutbert, 685; <li>Eadbert, 688; <li>Eadfrid, 698; <li>Ethelwold, 724; <li><a href="../cathen/04581d.htm">Cynewulf</a>, 740; <li>Higbald, 780; <li>Egbert, 803; <li>Heathored, 821; <li>Ecgred, 830; <li>Eanbert, 845; <li>Eardulf, 854.</ol>

<p>The book called the "Lindisfarne Gospels" ("St. Cuthbert's Gospels" or the "Durham Book") is still preserved in the British Museum Library (Cotton <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, Nero D. iv). This copy must not be confounded with a small copy of St. John's Gospel found in <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a> coffin in 1104, and now at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>. The former was written at Lindisfarne by Eadfrid "in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>" about 700. It consists of 258 leaves of thick vellum, 13 1/2 X 9 7/8 inches, and contains the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a> in the Latin of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> Version, written in double columns with an interlinear Saxon gloss &#151; the earliest form of the Gospels in English. It also contains <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> Epistle to Pope Damasus, his Prefaces, the Eusebian Canons, arguments of each Gospel, and "Capitula", or headings of the lessons. The glossator, Aldred, states that the ornamentation was the work of Ethelwold (724-740), and that the precious metal cover was made by Bilfrid (Billfrith) the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a>. It is written in a splendid uncial hand, and adorned with intricate patterns, consisting of interlaced ribbons, spiral lines, and geometrical knots, terminating sometimes in heads of birds and beasts. The intervening spaces are filled with red dots in various designs. Before each Gospel is a representation of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>. A table of festivals with special lessons seems to indicate that this <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> was copied from one used at a church in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. (For a fuller treatment of the origin of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, see Dom Chapman's "Early History of the Vulgate Gospels", where he gives a slightly different view of the subject.) The book remained at Lindisfarne till the flight of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, about 878, when it was carried away together with the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. During the attempted passage to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, it fell into the sea, but was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracuously</a> recovered after four days. In 995 it was brought to <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, and afterwards replaced in Lindisfarne, when the church there was rebuilt. For the space of 100 years it was lost sight of. In 1623 it was in the possession of Robert Bowyer, clerk to the House of Commons. He disposed of it to Sir Robert Cotton, whence it passed to the British Museum. Traces of its immersion in the sea have been detected by experts. Its present precious binding was a gift of Bishop Maltby. The codex was edited by Stevenson and Waring (1854-65), and by Skeat (1887).
