<h1>Ancient Diocese of Bristol</h1>  

<p>(BRISTOLIA, BRISTOLIENSIS).

<p>This English diocese, which takes its very origin from measures directed against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has a very brief <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> history, for it only had one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> acknowledged by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It was one of the six <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> which <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, acting as head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, attempted to found by Act of Parliament out of the spoils of the <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">suppressed monasteries</a>. This was in 1542, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in question being those of Bristol, Oxford Westminster, Gloucester, <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>. The fact that the city was then one of the leading towns in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the chief seaport, explains why it was selected as one of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Like the others, it possessed an important religious house, the buildings of which might serve the new purposes. As it was, the new diocese nearly lost its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>, which had been plundered at the time of the suppression of that house in 1539, was already in process of demolition, when the king's order came arresting the devastation. This house of Augustinians had been founded four hundred years before its dissolution by one Robert Fitzharding who began to build "the abbeye at Bristowe, that of Saint Austin is" in 1133. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church destined to serve hereafter as a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was of different dates: the old Norman <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> built by Fitzharding seems to have stood till the suppression, but the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a>, which still exists, was early fourteenth century, and the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> late fifteenth. The building as a whole was well worthy to serve as a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Yet at first Bristol does not seem to have been thought of as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, for it is not included in the list of projected sees now among the Cottonian <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in the British Museum.

<p>It has been suggested that its ultimate selection for this honor was due to Cranmer, who visited Bristol shortly before his election as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and busied himself in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs there. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be appointed when the king's charter of 1542 founded the new see, was Paul Bush, formerly master of the Bonshommes at Edyngton in Wiltshire, who, it is needless to say neither sought nor obtained recognition by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Himself an Augustinian and a man of some repute both as scholar and poet, he held fast to many of the old doctrines, and opposed Cranmer with regard to <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> and Masses for the dead. Yet he followed the new opinions so far as the marriage of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was concerned, and took as a wife one Edith Ashley. This fact <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be proceeded against as a married cleric in <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary's</a> reign. In 1554 a commission passed sentence of deprivation against him, which he anticipated by a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> resignation. This was the opportunity for placing the irregularly constituted diocese on a proper canonical footing, and <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Pope Paul IV</a> empowered <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a> to re-found the See of Bristol. The first and, as it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was John Holyman, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for learning and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> who had been the friend and subject of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Reading, <a href="../cathen/07518a.htm">Blessed Hugh Cook</a>.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Dr. Holyman gave general satisfaction, and, though he took part in the trial of Hooper, and served on a commission to try Ridley and Latimer, he took no active part in the proceedings on the score of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He died in the summer or autumn of 1538, and was thus spared the troublous times that began with the accession of Elizabeth in the following November. He was succeeded in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>, Dr. Richard Cheney (1562-79), who, though a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, was yet suspected of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leanings, and was the early friend of <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Blessed Edmund Campion</a>. But the history of Bristol as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> see ends with the death of Bishop Holyman. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was formed by taking the county and archdeaconry of Dorset from <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, and several <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> from the Dioceses of Gloucester and <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, with three churches in Bristol, which had belonged to Bath and Wells. The arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were sable, three ducal crowns in pale or. The dedication was changed at the dissolution from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>.
