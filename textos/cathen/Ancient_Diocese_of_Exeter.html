<h1>Ancient Diocese of Exeter</h1>  

<p>(EXONIA, ISCA DAMNONIORUM, CAER WISE, EXANCEASTER; EXONIENSIS).

<p>English see, chosen by Leofric, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Crediton, as his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city in 1050. Originally Devonshire formed part of the Diocese of Wessex. About 703 Devonshire and Cornwall became the separate Bishopric of Sherborne and in 900 this was divided into two, the Devonshire <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> having his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Crediton. The two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were again united when Leofric became first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Exeter. The present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun by Bishop William de Warelhurst in 1112; the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Mary and St. Peter, founded by Athelstan in 932 and rebuilt in 1019, serving till then as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> towers built by Warelhurst still remain, being the only part of the Norman <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> existing. This Norman building was completed by Bishop Marshall at the close of the twelfth century. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as it now stands is in the decorated style, being begun by Bishop Quivil (1280-1291), continued by Bytton and Stapeldon, and completed by the great Bishop Grandisson during his long pontificate of forty-two years, who left it much as it now stands. In many respects it resembles the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> rather than those of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The special features of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> are the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transeptal</a> towers and the choir. The latter contains much early <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained-glass</a> and a magnificent episcopal throne, and is separated from the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> by a choir-screen of singular beauty (1324). The absence of a central tower and a general lack of elevation prevent the building from ranking among the greatest <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, though the stately west front is alone sufficient to render it remarkable.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Exeter always enjoyed considerable independence and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was one of the largest and richest in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. "The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Exeter," writes Professor Freeman, "like the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a> was the spiritual head of a separate people." The remoteness of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> prevented it from being bestowed on statesmen or courtiers, so that the roll of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is more distinguished for scholars and administrators than for men who played a large part in national affairs. This was fortunate for the diocese and gave it a long line of excellent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, one of whom, Edmund Lacy, died with a reputation for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> (1455). The result of this was seen in the fidelity with which Devonshire and Cornwall adhered to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> at the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The following are the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with the dates of their accession: <ul> <li>Leofric, 1046 <li>Osbern, 1072 <li>William Warelwast, 1107 <li>Robert Chichester, 1138 <li>Robert Warelwast, 1155 <li>Bartholomew Iscanus, 1161 <li>John the Chaunter, 1186 <li><em>Vacancy</em> 1191 <li>Henry Marshall, 1194 <li><em>Vacancy</em> 1206 <li>Simon de Apulia, 1214 <li>William Bruere, 1224 <li>Richard Blondy, 1245 <li>Walter Bronescombe, 1257 <li>Peter Quivil, 1280 <li>Thomas de Bytton, 1292 <li>Walter de Stapeldon, 1308 <li>James Berkeley, 1326 <li>John Grandisson, 1327 <li>Thomas Brantyngham, 1370 <li>Edmund Stafford, 1395 <li>John Ketterick, 1419 <li>Edmund Lacy, 1420 <li>George Neville, 1458 <li>John Bothe, 1465 <li>Peter Courtenay, 1478 <li>Richard Fox, 1487 <li>Oliver King, 1492 <li>Richard Redman, 1496 <li>John Arundell, 1502 <li><a href="../cathen/11239b.htm">Hugh Oldham</a>, 1504 <li>John Vesey, 1519 <li><em>Vacancy</em> 1551 <li>James Turberville, 1555-1559 </ul>

<p>The diocese, originally very wealthy, was plundered during the reign of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, when Bishop Vesey was forced to surrender fourteen out of twenty-two manors, and the value of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was reduced to a third. Vesey, though a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> at heart, held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> until 1551, when he was made to resign, and the Reformer, Miles Coverdale, was intruded into the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, where he made himself most unpopular. On the accession of Mary, in 1553, Vesey was restored. He died in 1554 and was succeeded by James Turberville, beloved br <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> alike. He was deprived of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by Elizabeth in 1559 and died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, probably in or about 1570, the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Exeter. The diocese contained four archdeaconries, Cornwall, Barnstaple, Exeter, and Totton, and six hundred and four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. There were <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, Augustinian, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> houses, and four <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was dedicated to St. Peter, and the arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were: <em>Gules, a sword in pale blade and hilt proper, two keys in saltire or.</em>
