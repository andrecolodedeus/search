<h1>Ancient Diocese of Hereford</h1>  

<p>(HEREFORDENSIS)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Though the name of Putta, the exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester, is usually given as the first Bishop Of Hereford (676), <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede's</a> account merely states that he was granted a church and some land in Mercia by Sexulf, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>. This, however, was probably the nucleus from which the diocese grew, though its limits were not precisely fixed even by the end of the eighth century. In 793 the body of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> Ethelbert, King of the East Saxons, was buried at Hereford, and his shrine became a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> famous for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. His name was joined with that of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> as titular, so that the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was served by secular canons, was known as the Church of St. Mary and St. Ethelbert. The shrine was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> in 1055, when the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which had been recently rebuilt, was much damaged. It was restored after the Norman Conquest by Bishop Robert de Losinga, the intimate friend of St. Wulstan of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>. His immediate successors made further additions, and the great central tower was built about 1200. The clerestory to the choir, the beautiful Early English Lady Chapel and the north <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> were added during the thirteenth century. Unfortunately the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> has suffered much from unskilful restoration, and some of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> work has been replaced by eighteenth-century architecture, notably the west front, which was ruined by the fall of a tower in 1786. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was remarkable for not conforming to the <a href="../cathen/13479a.htm">Sarum Rite</a>, but for maintaining its own "Hereford Use" down to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. It had its own <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, and portions of the <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">antiphonary</a> have also survived. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was generally fortunate in its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, two of whom are specially prominent: John de Breton, the great English lawyer (1268-1275); and his successor, Thomas de Cantilupe, better known as <a href="../cathen/14694c.htm">St. Thomas of Hereford</a>, the last English saint to be <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. He was chancellor to King Henry III when he was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and had wide experience of government. In the disputes which arose between Archbishop Peckham and his suffragans, St. Thomas was chosen to lay the cause of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and while on this mission he died. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were buried at Hereford, where his shrine became the scene of numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Part of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were saved at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and are now at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>, but it would appear that some remained at Hereford, for as late as 1610 they were carried in <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> by the people during the plague. In the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is still preserved the celebrated "Mappa Mundi", designed by Richard of Battle in the thirteenth century. The diocese consisted of nearly all Herefordshire, with part of Shropshire, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the counties of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Monmouth, Montgomery and Radnor. It was divided into two archdeaconries, Hereford and Salop. There were about thirty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the Augustinians having seven, including the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Wigmore, and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> ten, among which was the great <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Leominster. There were Cluniacs at Clifford, Wenlock and Preen, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> at Dor&eacute; and Flaxley. <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> both had <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> in Hereford; at Ludlow there were <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> and Austin Friars.

<p>The following is the list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Hereford, with dates of appointment, the <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> before 1012 being partly conjectural: &mdash;
