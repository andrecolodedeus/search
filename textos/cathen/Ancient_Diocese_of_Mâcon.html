<h1>Ancient Diocese of M&acirc;con</h1>  

<p>(MATISCONENSIS)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. The city of M&acirc;con, formerly the capital of the M&acirc;connais, now of the Department of Sa&ocirc;ne-et-Loire, became a <em>civitas</em> in the fifth century, when it was separated from the &AElig;duan territory. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> appears to have been introduced from <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> into this city at an early period, and Hugh, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, in the eleventh century, called M&acirc;con "the eldest daughter of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>". The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, however, came into existence somewhat later than might have been expected: in the latter part of the fifth century it was still a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> who brought succour to the famine-stricken people of M&acirc;con. At the end of that same century <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis's</a> occupation of the city both foreshadowed the gradual establishment of <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> supremacy and brought with it the utter rout of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. Duchesne thinks that the Bishopric of M&acirc;con, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, may have originated in an understanding between the Merovingian princes after the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> state. The separate existence of M&acirc;con as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> ended at the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, and the title of M&acirc;con is now borne by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> historically known is <a href="../cathen/12142b.htm">St. Placidus</a> (538-55). The authentic list of his successors, as reconstructed by Duchesne, comprises several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: St. Florentinus (c. 561); St. C&aelig;lodonius, who assisted at the Council of Lyons in 570; St. Eusebius, who assisted at two councils, in 581 and 585. Tradition adds to this list the names of Sts. Salvinius, Nicetius (Nizier), and Justus, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of M&acirc;con in the course of the sixth century. Among other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of later date may be mentioned St. Gerard (886-926), who died in a hermitage at Brou near Bourg-en-Bresse, and Cardinal Philibert Hugonet (1473-84). For many centuries the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> seem to have been the only rulers of M&acirc;con; the city had no counts until after 850. From 926 the countship became hereditary. The M&acirc;connais was sold to St. Louis in 1239 by Alice of Vienne, daughter of the last count, and her husband, Jean de Braine. In 1435 Charles VII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, by the Treaty of Arras, ceded it to Philip, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, but in 1477 it reverted to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, upon the death of Charles the Bold. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> definitively recognized the M&acirc;connais as French at the Treaty of Cambrai (1529).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion filled M&acirc;con with blood; it was captured on 5 May, 1562, by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> d'Entragues, on 18 August, 1562, by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Tavannes, on 29 Sept., 1567, it again fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and on 4 Dec., 1567, was recovered by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of M&acirc;con were saved from the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, probably by the passive resistance with which the bailiff, Philibert de Laguiche, met the orders of Charles IX. Odet de Coligny, Cardinal de Ch&acirc;tillon, who eventually became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and went to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to marry under the name of Comte de Beauvais, was from 1554 to 1560 prior, and after 1560 <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, of St-Pierre de M&acirc;con. The Abbey of Cluny, situated within the territory of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was exempted from its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the eleventh century, in spite of the opposition of Bishop Drogon. There is stilt preserved in the archives of the city a copy of the cartulary of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of St-Vincent, rebuilt in the thirteenth century, but destroyed in 1793.

<p>Of the six councils held at M&acirc;con (579, 581-or 582-585, 624, 906, 1286), the second and third, convoked by command of King Gontran, are worthy of special mention. The first, in 581 or 582, which assembled six <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and fifteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, enacted penalties against luxury among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who summoned other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> before lay tribunals, and against religious who married; it also regulated the relations of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The second, in 585, at which 43 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the representatives of 20 other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assisted, tried the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> accused of having taken part in the revolt of Gondebaud, fixed the penalties for violating the Sunday rest, insisted on the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of paying <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, established the right of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to interfere in the courts when <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> were concerned, determined the relative precedence of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and decreed that every three years a <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a> should be convoked by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and the king.
