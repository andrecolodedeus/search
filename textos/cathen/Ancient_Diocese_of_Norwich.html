<h1>Ancient Diocese of Norwich</h1>  

<p>(NORDOVICUM; NORVICUM).

<p>Though this see took its present name only in the eleventh century, its history goes back five hundred years earlier to the conversion of East Anglia by St. Felix in the reign of King Sigeberht, who succeeded to the kingdom of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Redwald on the death of his half-brother Eorpweald in 628. St. Felix fixed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at Dunwich, a sea-coast town since submerged, the site of which is in Southwold Bay. From Dunwich, St. Felix evangelized Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire, the counties which formed the diocese. He was succeeded by Thomas (647), Beorhtgils (Boniface), who died about 669, and Bisi, on whose death, in 673, St. Theodore, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, divided the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> into two, with <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> at Dunwich and Elmham. The following are the lines of episcopal succession based on the most recent research, with approximate dates of accession where known:&mdash;

<p><em>Dunwich:</em> &AElig;cci, 673; Alric; &AElig;scwulf; Eardred; Ealdbeorht I; Eardwulf; Cuthwine; Ealdbeorht II; Ecglaf; Heardred; &AElig;lfhun, 790; Tidfrith, 798; Waermund; Wilred, 825.

<p><em>Elmham:</em> Beaduwine, 673; Nothbeorht; Heathulac; &AElig;thelfrith, 736; Eanfrith; &AElig;thelwulf; Ealhheard; Sibba; Hunfrith; St. Hunbeorht; Cunda (there is some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to whether Cunda was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Elmbam or Dunwich).

<p>The See of Elmbam came to an end about 870, when St. Edmund, King of the East Angles, and Bishop St. Hunbeorh were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the Danes. The country was ravaged, the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> destroyed, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was only practised with difficulty. Bishop Wilred of Dunwich seems to have reunited the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, choosing Elmbam as his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. His successors at Elmham were:&mdash;

<p>Husa; &AElig;thelweald; Eadwulf; &AElig;Ifric I; Theodred I; Theodred II; &AElig;thelstan; &AElig;lfgar, 1001; &AElig;lfwine, 1021; &AElig;lfric II; &AElig;lfric III, 1039; Stigand, 1040; Grimcytel, 1042; Stigand (restored), 1043; &AElig;thelmaer, 1047; Herfast, 1070. Bishop Herfast, a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to William the Conqueror, removed his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> chair to Thetford. He died in 1084, and was succeeded by William de Bellofago (de Beaufeu), also known as William Galsagus (1086-91). William de Bellofago was succeeded by Herbert de Losinga, who made a <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> gift to King William Rufus to secure his election, but being subsequently struck with remorse went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1094, to obtain <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He founded the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Norwich in expiation for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and at the same time moved his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> there from Thetford. The chapter of secular canons was dissolved and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> took their place. The foundation-stone of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was laid in 1096, in honor of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>. Before his death, in 1119, he had completed the choir, which is apsidal and encircled by a procession path, and which originally gave access to three Norman <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. His successor, Bishop Eborard, completed the long Norman <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> so that the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is a very early twelfth-century building though modified by later additions and alterations. The chief of these were the Lady <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> (<em>circa</em> 1250, destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Dean Gardiner 1573-89); the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> (<em>circa</em> 1300), the west window (<em>circa</em> 1440), the rood screen, the spire and the vault spanning the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> (<em>circa</em> 1450). The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> suffered much during the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>.

<p>The list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Norwich, with the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> of their <a href="../cathen/01095a.htm">accession</a>, is as follows:&mdash;

<p>Herbert Losinga, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1091, translated the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Norwich in 1094; Eborard de Montgomery, 1121; William de Turbe, 1146; John of Oxford, 1175; John de Grey, 1200; Pandulph Masca, 1222; Thomas de Blunville, 1226; Ralph de Norwich, 1236; vacancy, 1236; William de Raleigh, 1239; vacancy, 1242; Walter de Suffield, 1245; Simon de Walton, 1258; Roger de Skerning, 1266; William de Middleton, 1278; Ralph de Walpole, 1289; John Salmon, 1299; William de Ayerminne, 1325; Anthony Bek, 1337; William Bateman, 1344; Thomas Percy, 1356; Henry le Despenser, 1370; Alexander de Totington,-1407; Richard Courtenay, 1413; John Wakering, 1416; William Alnwick, 1426; Thomas Brown, 1436; Walter Lyhart, 1446; James Goldwell, 1472; Thomas Jane, 1499; Richard Nykke, 1501; William Rugg (schismatic), 1536; Thomas Thirleby (schismatic but reconciled in Mary's reign), 1550; John Hopton, 1554, who died in 1558, being the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Norwich.

<p>The diocese, which consisted of Norfolk and Suffolk with some parts of Cambridgeshire, was divided into four archdeaconries, Norfolk, Norwich, Suffolk, and Sudbury. At the end of the seventeenth century there were 1121 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-churches, and this number had probably not changed much since <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> times.

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in the diocese were: the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbeys of <a href="../cathen/03085a.htm">Bury St. Edmund's</a>, Wymondham, and St. Benet's of Hulm, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Norwich, the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Sibton, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> at Wendling, Langley, and Laystone. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were both found at Lynn, Norwich, Yarmouth, Dunwich, and Ipswich; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> also had houses at Thetford and Sudbury; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at <a href="../cathen/03085a.htm">Bury St. Edmund's</a> and Walsingham, where the great shrine of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> was; the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> were at Lynn, Norwich, Yarmouth, and Blakeney; and the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> at Norwich, Lynn, and Orford. There were no <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> in the diocese. The arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were azure, three mitres with their labels, or.
