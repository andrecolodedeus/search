<h1>Ancient Diocese of Salisbury</h1>  

<p>(SARUM, SARISBURIENSIS).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was originally founded by Birinus, who in 634 established his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at <a href="../cathen/05133c.htm">Dorchester</a> in Oxfordshire, whence he evangelized the Kingdom of Wessex. From this beginning sprang the later Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, Sherborne, Ramsbury, and Salisbury. In the time of Bishop St. Headda (676-705) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was moved to <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, and on Headda's death (705) a formal division took place, when the greater part of Wiltshire with portions of Dorset and Somerset were formed into the <a href="../cathen/13756c.htm">Diocese of Sherborne</a> of which <a href="../cathen/01280b.htm">St. Aldhelm</a> became the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in turn succeeded <a href="../cathen/01280b.htm">St. Aldhelm</a> before the next subdivision of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 909, when Wiltshire and Berkshire became the separate see of Ramsbury, restricting the <a href="../cathen/13756c.htm">Diocese of Sherborne</a> to Dorsetshire only. The arrangement continued until the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were again united in 1058 under Herman, who had been made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ramsbury in 1045. He lived to transfer his episcopal chair to Old Sarum in 1075. His successor, <a href="../cathen/11340a.htm">St. Osmund</a>, built a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> there and drew up for it the ordinal of offices, which became the basis of the <a href="../cathen/13479a.htm">Sarum Rite</a> It was the seventh <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sarum, Richard Poore, who determined to remove the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> from the precincts of the royal castle of Old Sarum to a more convenient spot. On 28 April, 1220, he laid the foundation stones of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, beginning with the Lady <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> which was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 28 Sept., 1225. Among those present was St. Edmund, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and at this time treasurer of Salisbury. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was completed in 1266, having taken nearly half a century to accomplish. It stands alone among <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> in having been built all of a piece, and thus possesses an <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> unity which is exceptional; it is also remarkable as being the first important building in the early English style. The <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> and <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter house</a> were shortly added; the spire regarded as the most beautiful in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> is one of the loftiest in the world, and was a later addition, the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of which is unknown; probably built by 1300. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was divided into four archdeaconries: Salisbury, Berkshire, Wiltshire, and Dorsetshire. In the "Valor Ecclesiasticus" of 1535, over 800 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches are recorded.

<p>From the translation of the see to Salisbury the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were:

<p><em>Old Sarum:</em> <ul> <li>Herman, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1058, removed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to Sarum, 1075; <li>St. Osmund, 1078; <li><em>vacancy</em>, 1099; <li>Roger, 1103; <li>Jocelin, 1142; <li><em>vacancy</em>, 1184; <li><a href="../cathen/07508c.htm">Hubert Walter</a>, 1189; <li>Herbert Poore, 1194. </ul>

<p><em>New Sarum:</em> <ul> <li>Richard Poore, 1217; <li>Robert Bingham, 1229; <li>William of York, 1247; <li>Giles de Bridport, 1257; <li>Walter de la Wyle, 1263; <li>Robert de Wykehampton, 1274; <li>Walter Scammel, 1284; <li>Henry de Braundeston, 1287; <li>William de la Corner, 1289; <li>Nicholas Longespee, 1292; <li>Simon of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 1297; <li>Roger de Mortival, 1315; <li>Robert Wyville, 1330; <li>Ralph Erghum, 1375; <li>John Waltham, 1388; <li>Richard Mitford, 1395; <li>Nicholas Bubwith, 1407; <li>Robert Hallam, 1408; <li>John Chandler, 1417; <li>Robert Neville, 1427; <li>William Ayscough, 1438; <li>Richard Beauchamp, 1450; <li>Lionel Woodville, 1482; <li>Thomas Langton, 1485; <li>John Blythe, 1494; <li>Henry Deane, 1499; <li>Edmund Audley, 1502; <li>Lorenzo Campegio, 1524. </ul>

<p>In 1534 Cardinal Campegio was deprived of the temporalities and Nicholas Shaxton was schismatically intruded into the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. On Campegio's death, <a href="../cathen/11785a.htm">Peter Peto</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>) was nominated but never <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Under Mary, the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, John Capon (or Salcot) was reconciled and held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> till his death in 1557. <a href="../cathen/11785a.htm">Peto</a> was again nominated, but did not take possession, and Francis Mallet was named, but ejected by Elizabeth before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>.
