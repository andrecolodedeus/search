<h1>Ancient Diocese of Sodor and Man</h1>  

<p>(SODORENSIS).

<p>The early history of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is extremely obscure. The Scandinavian diocese, which included Man and the western isles of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> (The Southern Hebrides), was called <em>Sodor</em> (<em>Suor-eyjar</em>) in contradistinction to <em>Nordr</em> (<em>Noror-eyjar</em>) &#151; the Orkneys and Shetland. It is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when Man was united with Sodor, but it may have been in the time of Magnus Barefoot (1098). Before that Man seems to have been a distinct see dependent on Dublin. When Man became the head of a separate kingdom, under the suzerainty of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, the joint Diocese of Sodor and Man was placed under the Archiepiscopate of Nidaros (Trondhjem) in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> by Eugenius III (1152), an arrangement which was confirmed by Anastasius IV (1154). From then till 1458 Man remained under Drontheim, when <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Calixtus III</a> transferred it to York.

<p>The political connection of Man with <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> had been severed in 1266, after which it depended on <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> till 1334 and finally on <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In the reign of Henry IV the king gave the island to the Stanleys, who thus acquired the patronage of the bishopries, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> never attained the status of spiritual lords of Parliament. The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Thomas Stanley, who was appointed during the reign of Mary and was recognized as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> till his death in 1568. It is uncertain whether he accepted Elizabeth's changes or enjoyed immunity under the protection of the Stanleys. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to St. Germain, was situated on St. Patrick's Isle and was built in 1245 on the site of an earlier building. It is now in a ruined state. There were only seventeen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the island, all comprised in one archdeaconry. The arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were: upon three ascents, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a> standing with her arms distended between two pillars, on the dexter whereof a Church, in base the ancient arms of Man.
