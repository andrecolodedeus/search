<h1>Ancient Diocese of Worcester</h1>  

<p>(WIGORNIENSIS.)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, created in 680 when, at the Synod of Hatfield under St. Theodore, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, the great Mercian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was divided into five <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Tatfrith, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Whitby, was nominated for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but he died before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and Bosel, one of his fellow <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in his stead. The history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was singularly uneventful, and it was specially fortunate in the fact that it never was long vacant, as so many other sees frequently were. The lines of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from 680 to 1565 were unbroken. The Mercian kings were profuse in the endowments which they lavished on the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, which was originally dedicated to St. Peter but afterwards to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. It was originally served by secular canons, but in the tenth century St. Oswald replaced them by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. He also rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, finishing the work in 983, but in 1041 the Danes burned the city and ruined the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and it was reserved for another saint, St. Wulstan, to rebuild it (1084-89). The new building frequently suffered from fire (1113, 1180, 1202). In 1216 King John was buried there, between the shrines of the two Worcester <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, Oswald and Wulstan; and two years later the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, once more restored, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at a great gathering at which the king and many <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and nobles were present. At various times modifications were made in the structure, which gradually assumed the Early Gothic character it now bears. Probably the Worcester <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> is among the earliest instances of English Gothic, dating from the later part of the twelfth century. The <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> are a mixture of Norman and Perpendicular work; the choir, lady <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and east <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> are Early English (1224). The <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> alone remains of St. Wulstan's work. The monastic buildings, of which only the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>, and refectory remain, were on the south and west of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.

<p>From the time of Henry VII the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was filled by <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, who represented the king's interest at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Among these was the future <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Pope Clement VII</a>. It was the special prerogative of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to act as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and thus to celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> at all assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at which the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> was present.
