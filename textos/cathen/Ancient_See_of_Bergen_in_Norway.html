<h1>Ancient See of Bergen in Norway</h1>  

<p>(BERGA, BERGENSIS.)

<p>The diocese included the Provinces of Nordre and Sondre Bergenhus, and the district of Sondmor in the Province of Romsdal. The discovery at Selo in 996 of the supposed remains of St. Sunniva and her companions led King Olaf Trygveson to build a church there. It was not, however, till 1068 that a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> were founded at Selo by King Olaf Kyrre. Bernard the Saxon was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but later on he removed to the newly founded city of Bergen, where he died as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> about 1090. In 1152 Bergen became a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of <a href="../cathen/15064a.htm">Trondhjem</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was set up there. Bishop Paul (1156-94) saw the completion of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Christ Church in time for the holding of a provincial council there and for the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of King Magnus Erlings&ouml;n, the first <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> king, in 1164. In 1170 the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Sunniva were translated to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. During the episcopate of Bishop Arne (1226-56), namely on 29 July, 1247, Cardinal Wilhelm of Sabina <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> King Haakon Haakonss&ouml;n. In 1271 the Royal Chapel of the Holy Apostles at Bergen was made collegiate. From 1275 to 1302 King Magnus built a great church (the finest in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>), as his new royal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, to receive a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Crown of Thorns. The dean took the title of Master of the (fourteen) Royal Chapels and was granted the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to use the episcopal ornaments. Bishop Arne Sigurdss&ouml;n (1305-14) regarded the privileges of the Chapel Royal at Bergen as an encroachment upon the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. He could not, however, deprive the dean, Finn Haldorss&ouml;n, of his semi-independent position, as the latter had the support of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Arne also asserted in vain his claim that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the F&aelig;r&ouml;e Islands should be chosen amongst the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the Diocese of Bergen. He was, however, successful in compelling the German merchants at Bergen to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>. Bishop Thorstein (1342-49) died of the Black Death, as did nearly all the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. To his successor, the Englishman Gisbrith (1349-69), we owe the Bergen Manuscript (Bj&ouml;rgynjar k&aacute;lfskinn). Aslak Bolt, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bergen from 1408, was translated to the See of <a href="../cathen/15064a.htm">Trondhjem</a> in 1430. Bishop Thorleif Olafss&ouml;n (1430-50), having joined Olaf Nilss&ouml;n at the <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> Convent of Munkalif, was killed there by the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> of the Hansa on 1 September, 1455. The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Olaf Thorkelss&ouml;n (1523-35) allowed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Christ Church, the Royal Chapel of the Apostles, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings at Bergen to be destroyed, when the fortress of Bergenhus was enlarged. His successor, Geble Pederss&ouml;n, became a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>.

<p>Eighteen provincial councils were held at Bergen. The most important were the following: The council of 1164 confirmed arrangements made in 1152 by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Cardinal Nicholas Breakspear [afterwards <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Pope Adrian IV</a>], with regard to the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> Church. Their object was the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> by the following means: (1) the establishment on a firm basis of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/15064a.htm">Trondhjem</a>; (2) the foundation of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters; (3) the assertion of the right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to inherit <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by will; (4) the enforcement of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">clerical celibacy</a>. The council of 1190 decreed the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of all of guilty sacrilege, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> towards clerks, rape, or of unlawful bearing arms in church and at public assemblies. King Sverre's Christian Law (<em>Christenret</em>) was published at this council. The council held in 1273 decided that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches in Iceland should belong to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and not to the landowners. A number of articles were also framed with a view to a reconciliation between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, but they were never accepted either by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or king. In 1280 many rules with regard to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> were made but not carried into effect, as the quarrel between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> broke out with renewed <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. At the council of 1320 a large number of regulations were made with regard to discipline. In 1327 the canons adopted at the provincial synod dealt with the relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The last provincial synod at Bergen was held in 1435. It dealt with the collection of money for the maintenance of the Council of Basle, the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> observance of Saturday, which was forbidden, and unauthorized begging on the part of religious.

<p>Among the religious institutions in the Diocese of Bergen before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, were the following: The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> with a chapter of 3 <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and 12 canons, the Collegiate Church of the Apostles (Chapel Royal), 12 canons and a dean; <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> (from at least 1240) and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (dating from the same period). There were also at St. Mary's, Bergen, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> from 1150-1507 and <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of St. Anthony of Vienne from 1507-28. At St. John's, Bergen, there were <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> from about 1180 to 1489. The Hospitals of St. Catharine (for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>) and of All Saints (for men) provided for the sick. Finally, the great Abbey of St. Michael's, Munkalif (Benedictine <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, 1108-1426; Brigittines, 1426-70 and 1479-1531; <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 1470-79), lay close to Bergen. The city and its suburbs contained in all no less than 26 churches. Elsewhere there were the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Lyse, colonized from <a href="../cathen/06161a.htm">Fountains Abbey</a>, Yorkshire, in 1146, and the Hospital of the Holy Spirit at Halsn&ouml; (about 1200-1539).
