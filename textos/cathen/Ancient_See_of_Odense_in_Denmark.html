<h1>Ancient See of Odense in Denmark</h1>  

<p>(OTHINIA, OTHONIENSIS.)

<p>The diocese included the islands of F&uuml;nen, Langeland, Taasinge, Laaland, Falster, Als, and Aer&ouml;. It was founded before 988 from <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a>, and the first church built at Odense was dedicated to St. Mary. Othinkar Hvide the Elder, a missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, is said to have preached <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in F&uuml;nen, but the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Odense whose name is known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is Reginbert (Reginar), an Englishman <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Archbishop Alnoth of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> in 1020 or 1022 and sent by King Canute the Great to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Reginbert was succeeded by Eilbert, a clerk of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> (about 1043-72). After his death the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was vacant and subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a>, until 1086, at the earliest, when the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Hubald was appointed its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. On 10 July, 1086, King St. Canute was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in the Church of St. Alban, Odense. The fame of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and the bad harvests which followed upon his <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> led to his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> and to the translation (19 April, 1101) of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> by Bishop Hubald to the new Church of Our Lady and <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a>. At King Eric Eiegod's request William II, King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, induced the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/05648a.htm">Evesham</a>, Worcestershire, to send over twelve of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to Odense in 1100. They served the newly-erected Cathedral of St. Canute, and later they and their successors formed the chapter. The Church of St. Canute, which was at first of wood, and connected with the great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the same name, was burnt down more than once, and the present fine building was not begun until the time of Bishop Gisico (1287?-1300?). It is built of brick in pure <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, and is considered one of the largest and finest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> edifices in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Its construction was continued under his successor, Peter Pagh (1304-39), who apparently assisted, even if he did not found, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Odense. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Nicholas Jonsen (1340-62), made the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> a free one in 1349; before this the pupils paid half the cost of their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Bishop Mogens Krasse (1460-74) seems to have finished the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His successor, Charles R&ouml;nnow (1474-1501), who had been <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady, was hostile to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at St. Canute's, and in 1474 drove them from the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, replacing them with regular canons. It was not till 1489 that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were brought back, at the command of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>.

<p>Long before this Odense was one of the richest <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. It was so exclusively regarded as belonging to the nobility that the famous Bishop Jens Andersen Beldenak endured much <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> on account of his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> origin. In 1529 he resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> to Canute Henriksen Gyldenstjerne, Dean of <a href="../cathen/16081b.htm">Viborg</a>. The latter can scarcely be regarded as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. His election was never confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and though <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in 1536 he was released in 1537. From the beginning of his episcopate he had practically been a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, and after 1537 he married and lived as a rich lay nobleman until his death (1568). Besides the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Odense with its <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>, containing the bodies of St. Canute and of his brother Prince Benedict, and its glorious reredos, etc., there are many fine churches at Nyborg, Svendborg, and elsewhere. Before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the diocese contained <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> at St. Mary's, Odense; <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, Odense and at Halsted (Laaland); <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> (?) <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at St. Gertrude's, Odense; Augustinian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Dalum; <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at Holm (Insula Dei), now Brahetrolleborg; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Odense, Svendborg, Nysted, and Nykjobing (Falster); <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at Odense; <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at Assens; a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> at Odense; and a <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Maribo (Laaland), the latter until 1620. Finally there were <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of the Holy Spirit at Odense, Assens, Faaborg, and Nakskov, and a Commandery of the Knights of St. John at Odense.

<p>At present there are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches at Odense (Church of St. Alban, dedicated in 1907), Svendborg, Nyborg, Assens, Maribo, and Glorup, as well as <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. There are also <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> of the Austrian province at Odense and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Maribo. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> have a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Odense, while those of St. Hedvig have a sanatorium in the ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of Dalum besides creches and kindergartens at Odense and Nyborg.
