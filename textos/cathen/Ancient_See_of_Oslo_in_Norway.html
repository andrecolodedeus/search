<h1>Ancient See of Oslo in Norway</h1>  

<p>(ASLOIA, ASLOENSIS.)

<p>Oslo occupied part of the site of Christiania (founded 1624). After the formation of the <a href="../cathen/16043c.htm">Diocese of Hamar</a> in 1152, the Diocese of Oslo was limited to the Provinces of Christiania, Smaalenene, Jarlsberg and Laurvik, and Akershus in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, and the Counties of G&ouml;teborg (Gothenburg) and Bohus in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. Although Rudolf, a court <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> brought by St. Olave from <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, lived at Sarpsborg (1015-30) and worked in the surrounding district, Asgaut (1047-72?) is usually regarded as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Oslo. Of his successors Nicholas Arnesson (1190-1225) played a great though unhappy part in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> politics. Bishop Haakon (1248-65) was very generous towards the chapter of Oslo; he was transferred to Trondhjem. Helge II (1304-21) was also a munificent benefactor of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Bishop Solomon (1322-52) was the only <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who survived the Black Death in 1349. In 1350 he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Gisebert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Bergen</a>, and Gyrder Ivarss&ouml;n, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Skalholt (Iceland). In 1352, by a provision of <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Pope Clement VI</a>, Gyrd Asless&ouml;n, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Olso, was compelled to exchange <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> with Bishop Sigfrid of <a href="../cathen/16076a.htm">Stavanger</a>. Bishop Eystein of Oslo (1385-1407) and Dean Arne of the Royal Chapel at Oslo took a prominent part in the negotiations connected with the union of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, and Sweden under Queen Margaret in 1397. Bishop Aslak Harniktsson Bolt of Oslo exchanged <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in 1408 with Bishop Jakob Knutsson of <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Bergen</a>, from which see Bolt was tranferred to Trondhjem. In 1522 Hans Mule, a favourite of Christian II and commandant of the Castle of Akershus, forced Bishop Andrew Muus to resign. Mule was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1524, but was drowned the same year. He was succeeded in 1525 by Hans Reff (d. 1545), the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Although originally a partisan of Christian II, Reff paid homage to Frederick I in 1532. He resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> into King Christian III's hands in 1536, but was appointed as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> superintendent of the Dioceses of Oslo and Hamar in 1541.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Oslo, which originated from the foundation of the town by King Harald Hardraade (c. 1060), was the finest building in the diocese. It was dedicated to St. Halvard, a cousin of Kings Harald Hardraade and <a href="../cathen/11234a.htm">St. Olaf</a>, who had been killed when defending a pregnant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from her pursuers, and whose body was cast up on the shore near Oslo. His silver shrine was placed in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, when it was rebuilt after Oslo had been burnt by the Danes in 1137, and it remained there till the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Important councils were held at Oslo in 1306 and 1436. The first of these was largely concerned with the maintenance of discipline in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>. It also issued an exhortation to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to have a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> always ready to hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> in every <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. In 1436 canons were made with regard to the payment of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> and other matters. Besides the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter with an <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> and canons, founded soon after 1150, there was a collegiate church at Oslo, namely, the Royal Chapel of St. Mary, with a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, six canons, and six vicars. In 1314 Haakon V united the provostship of St. Mary's, Oslo, with the dignity of chancellor of the kingdom. The city also contained a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> (Nonneseter) dedicated to St. Mary and founded before 1150, as well as a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> (St. Olave's) from before 1240 and a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> founded about 1286. The great <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">Abbey</a> of Hovedoe lay close to Oslo and was founded by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Kirkstead in Lincolnshire (England) in 1147. Other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in the diocese were the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Abbey of <a href="../cathen/11234a.htm">St. Olaf</a> at T&ouml;nsberg founded from Pr&eacute;montr&eacute; (c. 1190), and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> at Gimsoe (c. 1110). There were also <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> (Minorite) <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> at T&ouml;nsberg, Konghelle, and Marstrand (Sweden). Dragsmark (Mariskog, Silva Sanctae Mariae), in the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, seems to have belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>. Lastly there were the Hospital of <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">St. John of Jerusalem</a> at Varna, for the benefit of the king's courtiers and followers, and the house of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian canons</a>, Kastelle near Konghelle, both founded about 1198.
