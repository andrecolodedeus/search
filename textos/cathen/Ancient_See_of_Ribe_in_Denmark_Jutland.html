<h1>Ancient See of Ribe in Denmark (Jutland)</h1>  

<p>(RIPAE, RIPENSIS.)

<p>The diocese (29 deaneries, 278 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>) consisted of the modern <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> Provinces of Ribe, Vejle, and Ringkj&ouml;bing, and of part of North Schleswig. The first church built at Ribe was founded by St. Ansgar in 860, served by his biographer and successor, St. Rembert, and destroyed during the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> reaction after the latter's death in 888. It was rebuilt towards 948, in which year St. Leofdag. first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ribe, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Archbishop Adaldag of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, probably at the Council of Ingelheim (Germany), which the Jutish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> attended. Leofdag is said to have been <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> at Ribe. Until the death of his third known successor Vale (1044-59) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Ribe, <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a>, and Aarhus wandered about Jutland on missionary tours. In 1060, however, Jutland was divided into the four Dioceses of Ribe, <a href="../cathen/16001a.htm">Aarhus</a>, <a href="../cathen/16081b.htm">Viborg</a>, and Vestervig (Borglum). Bishop Thure (1125-34) began to build the fine Cathedral of Our Lady at Ribe, which was finished under Bishop Elias (1142-66), who founded the chapter in 1145. His successor Radulf (1170-71), an Englishman and chancellor to King Valdemar I, translated to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Leofdag, who, however, was never formally <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. He began the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Logum (Locus Dei) in North Schleswig, which was completed by his successor Stephen (1173-77), formerly <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Herrisvad (Scania). Bishop Omer (1178-1204) reduced the number of the canons of Ribe to twelve. Bishop Christian II (1288-1313) in 1298 greatly enriched the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which had been founded in 1145. Bishops <a href="../cathen/05538b.htm">Eskil</a> (1388-1409) and Henry Stangberg (1455-65) published synodal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> with a view to reforming both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Ivar Munk was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1499 but not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> till 1513. Although he was unable to prevent Duke Christian from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">protestantizing</a> North Schleswig, he kept the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> out of the rest of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Ivar Munk opposed Christian's election as King Christian III of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> in 1533, being however compelled as a privy councillor for Jutland to join that monarch's party, Ivar Munk resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 1534 in favour of his nephew, Olaf Munk. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace at Ribe was bestowed upon Ivar Munk and there he died in 1539. Like the other <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Olaf Munk was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> on 12 August, 1536. When released he had to promise to marry as well as to comply with the conditions imposed upon all the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. On the fulfillment of his promise the Abbey of Tvis was bestowed upon him, he was later readmitted to the privy council, and he lived the life of a rich nobleman until his death in 1569.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Ribe (restored in 1904), a Romanesque building with <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> additions and a tower <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1440, contained besides the shrine of St. Leofdag a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a>, which was a great centre for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>. <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a> was the patron of Ribe as well as of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and his cultus at Ribe is doubtless due to the trading connection between that city and the Low Countries. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church of Logum, the Romanesque churches near Ribe, like the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> built of volcanic stone brought from Andernach on the Rhine, and the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monument in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, the great carved stone set up by <a href="../cathen/07141b.htm">King Harold Bluetooth</a> near the funeral mounds of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, King Gorm the Old (d. 940) and Queen Thyra Danebod (d. 945) at Jellinge near Veile, are all memorials of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> past of the Diocese of Ribe. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consisted of four <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and twenty-one <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendaries</a> (twelve resident). There were eight minor canons and nearly fifty <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. In the city there were also the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Convent of St. Nicholas (founded before 1215), a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>, each <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1259, and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of the Holy Spirit, and a commandery of the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Knights of St. John of Jerusalem</a>, both <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from about 1300. Elsewhere there were the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbeys of Tvis, near Holstebro (founded by Prince Buris in 1163), of Logum, and of Seem, the last having been a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> till 1171. There were <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at Gudum and at Stubber, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> at Veile, and a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> at Kolding. At present (1912) there are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Esbjerg, Kolding, Fredericia, and Veile.
