<h1>Ancient See of Roskilde in Denmark</h1>  

<p>(ROSCHILDIA, ROSKILDENSIS.)

<p>Suffragan to <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, about 991-1104, to <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>, 1104-1536. The diocese included the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> Islands of Zealand and Moen and the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Island of R&uuml;gen (<a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>). About 960 <a href="../cathen/07141b.htm">King Harold Bluetooth</a> built a wooden church dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> at his new capital of Roskilde. Godebald (991-1021), Gerbrand (1022- 30), and Aage or Avoco (1030-48) were the first three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Roskilde. Godebald and Gerbrand were both Englishmen. Scania (Sweden) was subject to Roskidle from 991 to 1021, to <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>, 1021- 30, and again to Roskilde from 1030 to 1060, when Scania was divided between the <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Diocese of Lund</a> and the short-lived Diocese of Dalby. Bishop William (1048-76) began, and Bishop Svend Norbagge (1076-88) finished, with the help of King St. Canute, the first stone <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Roskilde in 1080. The following year he enlarged the existing <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a>, and made it into a chapter with fifteen <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendaries</a>. Bishop Svend also completed the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Ringsted begun by King Svend Estridssen. During the episcopate of Arnold (1089-1124) a nobleman named Peter Bodilsen led a popular movement in Zealand directed against the marriage of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. About this time the skull of Pope Saint Lucius I (253-55) was brought to Roskilde <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, of which he became the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>. This famous <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was given a year or two ago by the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> Government to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> for <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Other prominent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="../cathen/05538b.htm">Eskil</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> national hero <a href="../cathen/01060a.htm">Absalon</a>. <a href="../cathen/01060a.htm">Absalon</a> founded Copenhagen in 1168, and gave it to the See of Roskilde in 1191. The Island of Rugen was incorporated in the Diocese of Roskilde by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> in 1169. On 25 June, 1170, Valdemar I saw his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> St. Canute Lavard's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> enshrined and his own son Canute (VI) <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> on the same day in the Abbey of Ringsted. It was the first <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>. In 1171 <a href="../cathen/01060a.htm">Bishop Absalon</a> published the Ecclesiastical Laws of Zealand. Peter Sunesen, a former <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canon Regular of St. Augustine</a>, and a pupil of Abbot Stephen of <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">Saint Genevieve's</a>, Paris, and of Abbot St. William of Ebeltoft, succeeded <a href="../cathen/01060a.htm">Absalon</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Roskilde in 1191. He began the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Roskilde about A.D. 1200, in imitation of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, where Abbot Stephen was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 1192 till 1203. Peter Sunesen died in 1214. Bishop Niels Stigsen (1225-49) turned the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> from regulars into seculars. His successor, Jacob Erlandsen, the great champion of the claims of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as against the State, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Roskilde from 1249 until his transition to Lund in 1254, founded <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for poor boys at Roskilde and at <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>, and greatly favoured the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. Bishop Olaf I (1301-20) added to Roskilde <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> the lady-chapel, which was taken down in 1772 in order to make room for the ugly building in which the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> monarchs are still buried. Bishop Peter (V) Jensen Lodehat, formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16081a.htm">Vexi&ouml;</a> (Sweden) and then of <a href="../cathen/16001a.htm">Aarhus</a>, signalized his translation to the See of Roskilde in 1413 by forcibly removing the body of his benefactress Queen Margaret from Soroe <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. On Bishop Peter's death in 1416 King Eric of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> took possession of Copenhagen, which henceforward ceased to be episcopal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.

<p>Bishop Jens Andersen (1416-31) refurnished the choir of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which however was greatly damaged when most of the town was destroyed by the great fire of 14 May, 1443, during the episcopate of Jens Pedersen (1431-48). Consequently it was not till 1464 that Bishop Olaf Mortensen Baden (1461-85) was able to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the restored <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the Chapel of the Three Kings added to it by King Christian I. The same monarch founded the <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">University of Copenhagen</a> in 1479 in virtue of a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> from <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>. Bishop Baden was its first chancellor. The last truly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the learned Lage Urne (1512-29) who, like his predecessors for many generations, was also High Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. He managed to keep <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> out of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for the most part, and it was not till the time of his successor Joachim R&ouml;nnov, nominal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Roskilde (1529-36), that the deluge came. R&ouml;nnov had neither received <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation, nor had he been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. All episcopal functions were performed by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Vincent Lange, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gardar, Greenland. Although R&ouml;nnov had made great concessions to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, like the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in 1536, and, unlike them, kept in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> until his death in the Castle of Copenhagen in 1544. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Roskilde, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> churches of Soroe, Ringsted, and Skovkloster (now Herlufsholm), the five-towered church at Kallundborg, the unique fifteenth-century <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Priory of St. Mary's, Elsinore (Helsingor), all of whose buildings are intact, which was the home of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> controversialist Paulus Helix or Poul Helgesen (1480-1536?), and is not even mentioned in any English guide-book, these, the Romanesque churches of Zealand and Rugen, and many other buildings and works of art testify to the importance of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Of the institutions then existing, the chapter of Roskilde, dating from about 1080, and the chapter of the Collegiate Church of Our Lady at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>, each consisted of a numerous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. There were <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at Ringsted, where, besides St. Canute Lavard, the holy King Eric Plovpenning (d. 1250) and good Queen Dagmar (d. 1212) were buried. The Abbeys of Esrom, Soroe, the home of <a href="../cathen/13497a.htm">Saxo Grammaticus</a> the historian and the burial place of <a href="../cathen/01060a.htm">Absalon</a>, and Skovkloster, formerly at St. Peter's Naestved, belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>. There was an abbey of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> at Ebelholt, and the Knights of St. John had a great house at Antvortskov. The Canons of St. Anthony of Vienne had a house at Praestoe. As elsewhere in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, there were <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of the Holy Spirit and sometimes leper-houses (as at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a> and Kallundborg) in the towns. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>) <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of St. Mary at Roskilde contained the body of St. Margaret of Oeleshove (Olsemagle) near Kjoege, who was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1176. Another famous local saint was St. Andrew, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Peter's, Slagelse, who rode from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to Slagelse one <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a> according to the thirteenth-century legend. On the Island of Rugen there was the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Bergen</a>.

<p>Copenhagen is now (1912) the residence of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> for <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Iceland. There are about seven <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> (of the German province) at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a> and Ordrup, a house of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, a community of <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a> (<a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>) including a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the (German) <a href="../cathen/05388a.htm">Sisters of St. Elizabeth</a> and of the Assumptionist <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> conduct <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (including a grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>) at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a> and Ordrup; the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have one at Frederiksberg. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> and the Assumptionist Sisters keep secondary, and the former four elementary, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, as well as an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05388a.htm">Sisters of St. Elizabeth</a> possess splendid <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. There is also a training-home for young servants (Mariehjem) at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>. At Roskilde there are a church with two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and a fine <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> kept by the Daughters of the Divine Wisdom (Filles de la Sagesse). At Elsinore there is a church with a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> conducted by the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>. There are also churches at Kj&ouml;ge, Naestved, Ringsted, and Slagelse. The Island of Rugen now forms part of the <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Diocese of Breslau</a>, and is under the immediate superintendence of the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> as delegate of the prince-bishop. There is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church at <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Bergen</a>.
