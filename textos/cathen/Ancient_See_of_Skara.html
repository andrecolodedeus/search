<h1>Ancient See of Skara</h1>  

<p>(SCARAE; SKARONENSIS, SCARENSIS).

<p>Located in Sweden; suffragan to Hamburg (990-1104), to Lund (1104-64), and finally to Upsala (1164-1530). This diocese, the most ancient in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, included the Counties of Skaraborg, Elfsborg, and Vermland. It was founded about 990 at Skara, the capital of the country of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> (Gauthiod), the whole of which it embraced until about 1100, when the eastern portion of the Diocese of Skara was formed into that of <a href="../cathen/16053b.htm">Link&ouml;ping</a>. At the beginning there was no strict division of the country into <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and the missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> went about preaching wherever they would. Thus it is that, though Odinkar Hvite the Elder was apparently the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> stationed at Skara about 990, Sigurd, a court <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of King Olaf Tryggveson of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, is named as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Skara in the list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> written down about 1325 as an appendix to the Laws of the Western <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> (Vestgotalagen). It is added that he founded three churches in Vestergotland, and he also seems to have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Olaf Skotkonung, first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> King of Sweden, at Husaby near Skara in 1008. Odinkar's successor was Thurgaut, first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Skara (about 1012-30). He was nominally succeeded by Gotskalk, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Luneburg, who never left his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, although he had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the See of Skara by Archbishop Liavizo of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> (1030-32). Meanwhile Sigurd, or Sigfrid, an Englishman of Scandinavian origin and a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Glastonbury (?), took possession of the See of Skara about 1031, and remained there till after 1043. Although he entered into communication with Bremen and sent his relative and successor Osmund to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> there, both Sigurd and Osmund seem to have been regarded as intruders by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>-<a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. Osmund was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and refused to acknowledge the primacy of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>. In this refusal he was supported by King Anund Jacob. Consequently when Adalvard the Elder, subdean of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, who had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Skara by Archbishop Adalbert on the death of Bishop Gotskalk, came to Skara about 1050 to take possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, he was prevented from doing so, and had to wait for Osmund's departure for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1057 (?) before he could become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Skara <em>de facto</em>. Adalvard the Elder died in 1060 and was buried near the first Cathedral of St. Mary, which he had built. Acelin, dean of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1061, but never took possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Adalvard the younger, who had visited and buried his elder namesake in 1060, was invited on his expulsion from the See of Siguna in 1067 to become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Skara, but was recalled to Bremen by Archbishop Adalbert.

<p>Of the next four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Skara hardly anything is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Concerning Bishop Oedgrim the following facts are recorded. He was present at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1145. During his episcopate the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Varnhem was founded (1150) by some <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of Clairvaux who came from Alvastra. Finally in 1151 Bishop Oedgrim <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> part of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which Bishop Benedict I (1158-90) enlarged and furnished. The latter also built the Churches of St. Nicholas and of St. Peter at Skara as well as many roads and bridges. Bishop Jerpulf (1191-1201) persuaded a popular assembly at Askubeck to assign to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>. Benedict II (1217-30) founded several secular <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> in 1220, and thus originated the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. St. Bryniolph Algotsson is the best known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He studied for eighteen years at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, became dean of <a href="../cathen/16053b.htm">Link&ouml;ping</a>, and in 1278 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Skara. He issued <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> in 1231, and composed <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and other works, amongst them a "Life of St. Helena of Skoffde" (Schedvia), who was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in 1140 and was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, and whose remains were translated to Upsala in 1164. She was also greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at Tidsvilde (Zealand) and elsewhere in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. St. Bryniolph died on 6 February, 1317. In 1499 <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> granted leave for the translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, but St. Bryniolph was never formally <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. Under him and his successor, Bishop Benedict III Tunnesson (1317-21), that is between 1312 and 1320, the whole of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was restored. Bishop Sven the Great (1435-48?) <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> it in fresco.

<p>Bishop Bryniolph III Gerlaktsson (1478-1505) regulated the frontier between his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and that of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>. His successor, Bishop Vincent Hennings, was beheaded by Christian II at the Massacre of <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a> on 8 November, 1520, although he protested aloud on his way to the scaffold against the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of his condemnation. Then came Magnus Haraldsson (1523), whose election was not confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in spite of King Gustavus I Vasa's request. Johannes Franciscus de Potentia, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, was nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Skara the same year by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> provision, but the king refused to receive him. Bishop Magnus Haraldsson, though at first submissive towards Gustavus I, led his diocesans to Larf to take part in the rising of 1529. He was accordingly deposed by the king, who appointed in 1530 a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, Svend Jacobsson, in his place. Besides Skara <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church at Varnhem, there are interesting romanesque churches at Asklanda and elsewhere. At Husaby there was a spring dedicated to St. Brigid of Kildare. This <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> dedication may be accounted for by the fact that Olaf Skotkonung was, as mentioned above, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> there in 1008 by Sigurd, court <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of King Olaf Tryggveson, who had many connections with <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. <a href="../cathen/11234a.htm">St. Olaf</a> was specially <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at Dalby and Elgaa in Vermland.

<p>At Skara the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consisted latterly of a dean, an <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, a subdean, and twenty-one canons. There were also in the town a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from about 1242 and a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> from about 1260. At Lodose there were also <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> from 1283 and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> from 1286. Finally there were the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Varnhem and the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> at Gudhem; the latter was founded about 1160.
