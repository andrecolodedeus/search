<h1>Ancient See of Stavanger</h1>  

<p>(STAVANGRIA; STAVANGRENSIS)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>; included the Provinces of Stavanger, Lister and Mandal, and Nedenes. It was formed early in the twelfth century out of the southern portion of the <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Diocese of Bergen</a>, which had included until then the whole of Western <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> (Gulathingslagen). Reginald, an Englishman and most probably a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Stavanger. With the money given him in 1128 by King Sigurd Jorsalefarer, for allowing that monarch to marry one Cecilia during the lifetime of his consort Queen Malmfrid, Reginald began the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and founded the chapter. He was hanged at <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Bergen</a> in 1135 by King Harald Gille upon his refusing to impoverish his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by paying fifteen marks of gold to that monarch, who suspected him of concealing the treasures belonging to King Magnus IV. Reginald's successor, John Birgerss&ouml;n, was translated to Trondhjem in 1152, as was also Bishop Eric Ivarss&ouml;n in 1188. The great quarrel lasting from 1294 to 1303, which Bishop Arne (1276-1303) had with his chapter, was terminated only by the intervention of King Haakon, who decided in favour of the chapter and decreed, among other things, that they should have a voice in all nominations to, and deprivations of, <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in the diocese. Bishop Gutterm Paalss&ouml;n (1343-50) died of the Black Death. His successor, Arne Aslakss&ouml;n, also died suddenly at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, whither he had gone to seek a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> <em>super defectu natalium</em>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> appointed Sigfrid, a <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Stavanger by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> provision in 1351. Most of his successors were appointed in the same way after agreement with the king. In 1352 Sigfrid was transferred to <a href="../cathen/16065a.htm">Oslo</a>, while Gyrd Asless&ouml;n, who had just been appointed to that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, had to accept in 1354 the less lucrative See of Stavanger. He was soon succeeded by Botolph Asbjornss&ouml;n (1355-81), who gave his <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> to the chapter and compiled a Domesday Book (Jordebog) for the diocese. It has since disappeared. Bishop Audum Eivindss&ouml;n (1426-55) built many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and gave the episcopal <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of Valdres to the <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittines</a> of Munkalif near Bergen in 1441 in their hour of need. The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Hoskold Hoskoldss&ouml;n (1513-37), who was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by Thord Rod at <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Bergen</a> and died there.

<p>The fine Cathedral of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> and <a href="../cathen/14357c.htm">St. Swithun</a>, with its twelfth century Norman <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and its Gothic choir (from 1275-97), which once contained the shrine of <a href="../cathen/14357c.htm">Saint Swithun</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the old Bishop's Palace (Munkkirken) <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the same period as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> choir, King Olaf Tryggveson's church (from 995) on the Island of Moster, the fine thirteenth-century church at Avaldsnes, and many other buildings are monuments of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> past. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consisted of dean, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, subdean, and ten canons. The Church of St. Olaf, Avaldsnes, was collegiate, though most often it was served by only one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. It was a royal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, as were also the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of St. Peter at Saurboe (Ryfylke), of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> at Huseby (Lister), and another chapter dedicated to <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> at Egersund. The last three <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were not collegiate. The only <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of importance was the Augustinian Abbey of Utstein founded about 1280. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Stavanger had many disputes with the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Utstein. In 1537 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was handed over to Thrond Ivarss&ouml;n, who had, however, to maintain the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are said to have existed in the Diocese of Stavanger, but little or nothing is known of them. There was a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> dedicated to St. Peter at Stavanger itself. There is now a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church at Stavanger.
