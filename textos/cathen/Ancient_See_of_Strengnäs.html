<h1>Ancient See of Strengn&auml;s</h1>  

<p>(STRENGAE, STRENGENSIA; STRENGENESIS).

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. The diocese consisted of the County of Nykoping, the County of <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a> south of Lake Malar, and the southern half of the County of Orebro. In 829 <a href="../cathen/01544c.htm">St. Anschar</a> and his companion, Witmar, having reached Bjoerkoe (Birca), an island on Lake Malar and a great centre of trade, were well received and made many converts. Returning to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 831, <a href="../cathen/01544c.htm">St. Anschar</a> was made first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> by <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory IV</a> and given a share in the superintendence of the Northern Mission hitherto exercised by Ebbo, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Rheims</a>. Ebbo's relative Gautbert (Simon) became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> and built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> at Bjoerkoe. This success incurred the enmity of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, who drove him from the country in 837, and slew his relative Nithard. <a href="../cathen/01544c.htm">St. Anschar</a> sent Ardgeir to Sweden in 844, but he did not stay long. <a href="../cathen/01544c.htm">St. Anschar</a> revisited Bjoerkoe in 853, when a law tolerating <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was passed, and until 865 <a href="../cathen/13057a.htm">St. Rimbert</a>, the biographer and successor of <a href="../cathen/01544c.htm">St. Anschar</a>, and other missionaries worked there. In 936 Archbishop Unni visited Bjoerkoe and died there. In 1066 the city was utterly destroyed. About 1080 St. Eskil, an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, while at Sodermanland, disturbed a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> sacrifice held at Strengas and was killed. Botvid, a native <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> converted in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, continued the preaching of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> until his <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, 28 July, 1120, by a Slavonic captive whom he had redeemed. About this time St. Regnhild, wife of King Inge II, died and was buried at Sodertelje, of which town she became the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>. In 1152 the limits of the Diocese of Strengn&auml;ss were determined at an assembly at <a href="../cathen/16053b.htm">Link&ouml;ping</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Gerder (1129-59), who founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Strengn&auml;s. He was succeeded by Bishop William (1160-1208). In 1160 the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Juleta was founded. In 1165 Nericia (Nerike) was added to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. About this time the building of Strengn&auml;s <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun. In 1176 of 1179 the new stone church as Botkyrka was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Bishop William and Archbishop Stephen of Upsala; the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Botvid were translated thither. A <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">St. John of Jerusalem</a> was built over the grave of St. Eskil, and was restored in 1255. Bishop Olaf or Ulf Bonde (1208-24), called Bassat&auml;mir, a nephew of King St. Eric IX, was transferred to Upsala. The see lay vacant for nine years, but in 1233 Bishop Trogil was elected. About this time the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of Vaarfruberga (Mons. Mariae) on the Island of Fogdoe and in 1234 the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> at Nykoping were founded. About 1250 Frogil was succeeded by Colo or Kol (Charles?), who resigned in 1257 and was succeeded by Bishop Finved (1257-75). About 1268 the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> at Strengn&auml;s was founded. In 1291 Bishop Annund (1275-91) <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was burnt down on the same day, and rebuilt by Isarus, the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1291-1303). In 1305 it was decided that the city of <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a> belonged to <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a>, but that Sondermalm belonged to Strengn&auml;s.

<p>The most famous of the later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was Conrad Rogge (1479-1501), a doctor of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and a learned <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>. He built the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> choir about 1481, and founded a charterhouse at Svartsjo about 1493 and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for aged and infirm <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Strengn&auml;s in 1496. In 1495 he had the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of Strengn&auml;s printed at <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a> in a revised edition. His successor, Matthias Gregerson Lilje, was the protector of "the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>", Olaus Petri Phase (b. at &Ouml;rebro, 1493), who, having studied as a disciple of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melancthon</a> at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> (1516-18), returned to Strengn&auml;s in 1519. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> made him chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and master of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and in 1520 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and became canon of Strengn&auml;s. There he taught <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, with which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> Bishop Gregerson was entirely unacquainted. On 8 Nov., 1520, that unfortunate <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was beheaded during the massacre at <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a>. King Christian II gave the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> to Jens Andersen Beldenak, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16064d.htm">Odense</a>, who, however, returned to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> in April, 1521. During the vacancy the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was governed by Laurentius Andreae who had become <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Strengn&auml;s in 1520. He greatly favoured Olaus Petri, and as chancellor of King Gustavus Vasa (1523) he promoted the interests of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Strengn&auml;s, if he can be called so, was Magnus Sommar (1528-36), dean of Strengn&auml;s in 1518, nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by Gustavus Vasa in 1522, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation by Petrus Magni, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592b.htm">Westeraas</a>, 6 Jan., 1528. Messenius states that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> elect signed a document in which they promised to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to seek <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation, and thus persuaded Petrus Magni to proceed to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Magnus Sommar was very submissive towards the king, but his concessions did not save him. For a slight offense he was deposed and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and only released in order that he might retire to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Krokek.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Strengn&auml;s with its numerous <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, one of which now contains a fine museum of ecclesiastical art, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace, built about 1490, now the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, the fine Church of St. Nicholas at the interesting old town of Orebro, and numerous ancient village churches bear witness to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the inhabitants in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> times. Three <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> were held at Telge in the Diocese of Strengn&auml;s in 1279, 1341, and 1380. The first two issued <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> on matters concerning the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, while the synod of 1380 threatened with divers penalties those who molested the tenants of church lands. The "Sondermannalagen", a code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> published early in the fourteenth century for the people of Sodermanland, contains a number of ecclesiastical laws. Among other institutions, there was in the diocese the chapter of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, funded about 1288, which counted thirteen members at the end of the fifteenth century, besides which there were a least eighteen <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, who served the eighteen altars. To the institutions mentioned throughout the article must be added the charterhouse of Mariefred (1491-1526), and the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Orebro founded in 1418.
