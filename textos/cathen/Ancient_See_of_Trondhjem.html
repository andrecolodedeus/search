<h1>Ancient See of Trondhjem</h1>  

<p>(NIDAROS).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> it was the kings who introduced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which first became known to the people during their martial expeditions (Hergenr&ouml;ther, "Kirchengeschichte", 1879, II, 721). The work of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianization</a> begun by Haakon the Good (d: 981) (Maurer, "Die Bekehrung des norwegischen Stammes", <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1855, I, ii, 168) was carried on by Olaf Trygvesson (d. 1002) and Olaf Haraldsson (St. Olaf, d. 1030). Both were converted vikings, the former having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at Andover, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, by Bishop Aelfeah of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, and the latter at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> by Archbishop Robert (Bang, "Den norske Kirkes Historie under Katholicismen", Christiania, 1887, 44, 50). In 997 Olaf Trygvesson founded at the mouth of the River Nid the city of Nidaros, afterwards called Trondhjem, where he built a royal palace and a church; he laboured to spread the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, the Orkney and Shetland Islands, the Faroe Islands, <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Iceland</a>, and Greenland (Maurer, op. cit., I, iii, 462). King Olaf Haraldsson created an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at Nidaros, installing the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Grimkill as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Moreover, many English and German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> laboured in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, and by degrees <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> softened the rough <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a> of the people. The <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were at first dependent on the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>-Bremen, and afterwards on the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Scandinavia. As the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegians</a> nevertheless wanted an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of their own, <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a>, resolving to create a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> at Trondhjem, sent thither as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> (1151) Cardinal Nicholas of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a> (Nicholas Breakspeare), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> installed Jon Birgerson, previously <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16076a.htm">Stavanger</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Trondhjem. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/16065a.htm">Oslo</a> (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> 1073), Bergen (about 1060), Stavanger (1130), Hamar (1151), the Orkneys (1070), Iceland (Skalholt, 1056; Holar, 1105), and Greenland became suffragans.

<p>Archbishop Birgerson was succeeded by Eystein (Beatus Augustinus, 1158-88), previously royal secretary and treasurer, a man of brilliant <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, strong will, and deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> (Daae, "Norges Helgener", Christiania, 1879, 170-6). Such a man was then needed to defend the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the encroachments of King Sverre, who wished to make the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a mere tool of the temporal power. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was compelled to flee from <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he was able to return and that a sort of reconciliation took place later between him and the king, but on Eystein's death Sverre renewed his attacks, and Archbishop Eric had to leave the country and take refuge with Archbishop <a href="../cathen/01060a.htm">Absalon of Lund</a>. At last, when Sverre attacked the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> laid the king and his partisans under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> (<a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a> "Epp. Innocentii III", Paris, 1682, I, i, 226, 227). King Haakon (1202), son and successor of Sverre, hastened to make peace with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose liberty had been preserved by the unflinching attitude of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. What would have happened, asks the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a> of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, Dr. A. Chr. Bang, "if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, deprived of all liberty, had become the submissive slave of absolute royalty? What influence would it have exercised at a time when its chief mission was to act as the educator of the people and as the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> counterpoise to defend the liberty of the people against the brutal whims of the secular lords? And what would have happened when a century later royalty left the country? After that time the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was in reality the sole centre about which was grouped the whole national life of our country" (op. cit., 109). To regulate <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, which had suffered during the struggles with Sverre, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> in 1247 sent Cardinal William of Sabina as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. He intervened against certain encroachments on the part of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, reformed various abuses, and abolished the ordeal by hot iron. Owing in great measure to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> became more closely linked with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme head of Christendom</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Secular <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> worked together for the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Eilif Kortin (d. 1332), Paul Baardson (d. 1346), and Arne Vade (d. 1349) showed specially remarkable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Provincial councils were held, at which serious efforts were made to eliminate abuses and to encourage <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and morality (Bang, op. cit., 297).

<p>Nidaros (Trondhjem), the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, was also the capital of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. The residence of the kings until 1217, it remained until the troubles of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the heart and centre of the spiritual life of the country. There was situated the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/11234a.htm">St. Olaf</a>, and around the patron of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, "Rex perpetuus Norvegiae", the national and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life of the country was centred. Pilgrims flocked from all quarters to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. The feast of <a href="../cathen/11234a.htm">St. Olaf</a> on 29 July was a day or reunion for "all the nations of the Northern seas, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegians</a>, Swedes, Goths, Cimbrians, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danes</a>, and Slavs", to quote an old chronicler ("Adami gesta pontificum Hammaburgensium", <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, 1876, II, 82), in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Nidaros, where the <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> of <a href="../cathen/11234a.htm">St. Olaf</a> rested near the altar. Built in Roman style by King Olaf Kyrre (d. 1093), the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> had been enlarged by Archbishop Eystein in Ogival style. It was finished only in 1248 by Archbishop Sigurd Sim. Although several times destroyed by fire, the ancient <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> was restored each time until the storms of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Then Archbishop Eric Walkendorf was exiled (1521), and his successor, Olaf Engelbertsen, who had been the instrument of the royal will in the introduction of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, had also, as a partisan of Christian II, to fly from Christian III (1537). The valuable <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a> of <a href="../cathen/11234a.htm">St. Olaf</a> and St. Augustine (Eystein) were taken away, sent to Copenhagen, and melted. The bones of <a href="../cathen/11234a.htm">St. Olaf</a> were buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and the place forgotten. But when <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> regained its liberty and resumed it placed among independent nations (1814), the memory of the glory of its ancestors awoke. It was resolved to rebuild the ancient <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> stands once more renewed, although not in possession of the religion which created it. But new churches have arisen in the city of <a href="../cathen/11234a.htm">St. Olaf</a>, bearing witness that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> still lives in Scandinavia in spite of all its trials.
