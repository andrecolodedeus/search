<h1>Ancient See of Upsala</h1>  

<p>When St. Ansgar, the Apostle of the North, went to Sweden in 829 the Swedes were still <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and the country contained many sacrificial groves and <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> for the worship of idols. One of the most celebrated of the latter was the temple at Upsala in what is now called Old Upsala, the centre of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> worship not only for Sweden but for all Scandinavia. Even after <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had spread through Sweden, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were still maintained at Upsala. The "Bishops' Chronicle", written by <a href="../cathen/01132c.htm">Adam of Bremen</a> in the years 1072-76, says, "The <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedes</a> have a well-known heathen temple called Upsala", and adds, "Every ninth year, moreover, a great feast is celebrated at Upsala, which is observed in common by all the provinces of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. None is permitted to avoid participation in the feast . . . . More horrible than any punishment is that even those who have become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> must purchase exemption from participation in the feast . . . . The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are made thus: Nine heads are offered for every living creature of the male sex. By the blood of these the gods are appeased. The bodies are hung up in a grove not far from the temple. Dogs and horses may be seen hanging close by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human beings</a>; a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> told me he had seen seventy-two bodies hanging together."

<p>An <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was established at Old Upsala. One of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was St. Henry, who took part in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> to Finland led by St. Eric and suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> there in 1157. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Sweden were first suffragans of the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen, of which see St. Ansgar was <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> when he died. Afterwards the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were suffragans of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Scandinavia. In 1152 Cardinal Nicholas of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>, later <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Pope Adrian IV</a>, visited Sweden and held a provincial synod at <a href="../cathen/16053b.htm">Link&ouml;ping</a>. He had been commissioned to establish an independent Church province in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, but the matter was deferred, as the Swedes could not agree upon the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. 

<p>However, in 1164, <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a> established a separate <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Sweden with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at Upsala. The suffragans were the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/16074b.htm">Skara</a>, <a href="../cathen/16053b.htm">Link&ouml;ping</a>, Strengn&auml;s, and Wester&#229;s; at a later date the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Wexi&ouml; and &#197;bo in Finland were added. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Upsala was Stephen, a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Alwastra. Cardinal William of Sabina came as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to Sweden during the archiepiscopate of Jarler, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> (1235-55). The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> had been commissioned, among other things, to establish <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters wherever such were lacking, and to grant them the exclusive right of electing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Another important matter which the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">clerical celibacy</a>. At a provincial synod held at Skenninge in 1248 under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, the rules as to <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> were made more severe. The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and energetic Archbishop Jarler and his successor Laurentius (1257-67), a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, constantly strove to elevate the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and to enforce the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">law of celibacy</a>. A century later the great saint of Sweden, <a href="../cathen/02782a.htm">St Bridget</a> (d. 1373), laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the enforcement of the same law.

<p>A new era arose in the history of the archdiocese when Archbishop Folke (1274-77) transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from Old Upsala to Aros, a town near by on the Fyris which was given the name of Upsala. This change was approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the king, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the national saint, St. Eric, were also transferred to the new see. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Upsala, the most important church of Sweden and the largest in Scandinavia, was built by the French architect Etienne de Bonnuille in 1287. It was a masterpiece of the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, and is a monument of what <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> art and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> self-sacrifice were able to create under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. The labours of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> extended in all directions. Some were <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of their flocks, such as Jarler and others; some were distinguished canonists, such as Birger Gregerson (1367-83) and Olof Larsson (1435-8); others were statesmen, such as J&ouml;ns Bengtsson Oxenstjerna (d. 1467), or capable administrators, such as Jacob Ulfsson &Ouml;rnfot, who was distinguished as a prince of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, royal councillor, patron of art and learning, founder of the <a href="../cathen/15208a.htm">University of Upsala</a>, and an efficient helper in the introduction of printing into <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. He died in the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mariefred (Mary's Peace) in 1522. There were also scholars, such as Johannes Magnus (d. 1544), who wrote the "Historia de omnibus gothorum sueonumque regibus" and the "Historia metropolitan&aelig; ecclesi&aelig; upsaliensis", and his brother Olaus Magnus (d. 1588), who wrote the "Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus" and who was the last <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Upsala.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> found active co-workers among the regulars. Among the orders represented in Sweden were the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittines</a> (with the mother-house at Wadstena), <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, etc. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> not only laboured in things spiritual, but were also the teachers of the people in agriculture and gardening. Still greater credit is due the members of the orders, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, for their services in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> training of the people of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. A <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> investigator, Carl Silfverstolpe, writes: "The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were almost the sole bond of union in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> between the civilization of the north and that of southern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and it can be claimed that the active relations between our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and those in southern lands were the arteries through which the higher civilization reached our country." The beneficial labours of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were forgotten in the stormy days of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, but in the present era they have been once more recognized by more dispassionate investigators. Dr. Claes Annerstedt, the historian of the <a href="../cathen/15208a.htm">University of Upsala</a>, says: "One of the finest results of modern research is that the highly important labours of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> have received proper recognition by the exhibition of its services in the preservation and spread of civilization."
