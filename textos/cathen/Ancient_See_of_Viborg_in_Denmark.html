<h1>Ancient See of Viborg in Denmark</h1>  

<p>(VIBERGAE, VIBERGENSIS.)

<p>The ancient See of Viborg, in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, comprised the Province of Viborg, the town of Aalborg, and the hundreds of Fleskum, Hornum, Hellum, Hindsted, Aars, Gislum, and Slet in the Province of Aalborg. The hundreds of Gjerlev, Onsild, N&ouml;rhald, and St&ouml;vring in the Province of Randers also belonged to the Diocese of Viborg until 1396 when they were transferred to that of <a href="../cathen/16001a.htm">Aarhus</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was founded in 1065 after the death of Bishop Vale (see <a href="../cathen/16070b.htm">ANCIENT SEE OF RIBE</a>). Herbert was first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Viborg (1065-1100?). In 1080 St. Canute endowed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and chapter. The latter consisted of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a>. Bishop Svend I (1106-1112) was drowned in the Elbe by the Count of Stade, and Eskild (1112-33), who began rebuilding the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> about 1130, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> during <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> in the Church of St. Margaret by command of King Eric Emun. Svend II (1135-51) was succeeded as <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the chapter by Willo, and he by St. Kjeld or Ketil (d. 27 Sept., 1150). Bishop Niels I (1153-91) was very generous towards his chapter. He founded the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. Michael, Viborg, in 1159, and the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of Asmild in 1169, and finished the original Romanesque <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, of which only the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> now remains. It is also largely due to him that St. Kjeld was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a>, and his body translated to the shrine, suspended from the vaulting of his <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on 11 July, 1189.

<p>Bishop Gunner was one of the greatest men of his time. He was born in 1152 and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, where he acquired a great <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of law. In 1208 he entered the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of &Ouml;m (Cara Insula), of which he was chosen <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in 1216. In 1222 he was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Viborg by the chapter on the advice of Cardinal Gregory of Crescentia. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he devoted special care to the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He probably wrote out the Law of Jutland (Jydske Lov) and composed the original preface to it, and was present when it was published at Vordingborg in 1241. He died at Asmild, 25 Aug., 1251, and was buried in front of the shrine of St. Kjeld. Thorleif Olafss&ouml;n (1438-50) was translated to <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Bergen</a>, and succeeded at Viborg by Canute Mikkelsen (1451-78), dean of the Church of Our Lady at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the University of Erfurt in 1434. A great diplomatist and jurist, he was author of the Latin notes appended to the first two editions of the Law of Jutland and of a popular treatise on the plague. The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was J&ouml;rgen Friis (1521-36). He was a worldly-minded man and quite unable to cope with the movement to which the preaching of Hans Tausen at Viborg (1525) gave rise. In 1530 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was in the possession of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Friis retired to the Castle of Hald, where he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in his own dungeon in 1536. Two years later he was released on promising to submit to the new order of things. In 1540 he was endowed with the lands of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">Abbey</a> of Vrejlev and some of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and though he never married, he led the life of a lay nobleman until his death in 1547.

<p>Though the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> began at Viborg, certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> usages were kept up in its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> longer than anywhere else in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. The shrines of St. Kjeld and <a href="../cathen/15628a.htm">St. Willehad</a> were removed to the choir of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1538, but <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> continued to recite daily the <a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of King Eric Glipping (d. 1286) from 1560 to 1630. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Bishop Hans Wandal shortened and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantized</a> the service and entrusted its performance to the senior <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and twelve of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> boys. These all benefited by the endowment, and continued the service until 1684. Of the twelfth-century <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> nothing remains but the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>. The upper church built in 1876 contains splendid frescoes by Joachim Skovgaard begun in 1895 and a <a href="../cathen/13741b.htm">seven-branched candlestick</a> from 1494. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church of Grinderslev, the Church of St. Botolph, at Aalborg, and numerous village churches are memorials of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> past. At Karup there was a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Our Lady's Well. The chapter of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Mary and St. Kjeld was secularized in 1440, after which it consisted of a dean, an <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a>, and twelve secular canons. There were also at Viborg the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of St. Botolph, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> friary from 1235, and a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> friary from 1246, as well as the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of St. Michael and of the Holy Ghost. At Aalborg there were a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> and a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> friary. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">Abbey</a> of Vidskild (Vitae Scola) founded in 1158, the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Grinderslev founded before 1176, and the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of Asmild were all situated in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as were also the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> (?) <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of Sibber, and the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Tesdrup and Karup. In 1523 there were 236 churches in the Diocese of Viborg. Now (1912) the Camillians have a church and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Aalborg, while Viborg is one of their out-stations.
