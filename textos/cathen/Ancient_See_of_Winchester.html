<h1>Ancient See of Winchester</h1>  

<p>(WINTONIA, WINTONIENSIS).

<p>This diocese came into existence in 635 when the great missionary <a href="../cathen/05133c.htm">Diocese of Dorchester</a>, founded by St. Birinus in 634 for the Kingdom of Wessex, was subdivided into the Sees of Sherborne and Winchester. The two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were ruled by one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> until 676, when a real separation was effected. The Diocese of Winchester then consisted of Hampshire, Surrey, and Sussex; but Sussex was afterwards formed into the See of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>, and the Isle of Wight was added to Winchester. The church at Winchester, which became the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the new diocese, had been founded and endowed in 634 by King Cynegils, whose son Coenwealh added more lands to its possessions. When Wessex gradually assumed the supremacy the importance of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> greatly increased. After the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Sees of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and York, it ranked first among all English <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> till the reformation; this position the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> see still enjoys. It gained increased <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by the episcopate and subsequent <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="../cathen/14357c.htm">St. Swithin</a>, its seventeenth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. When his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were enshrined there the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which had been under the patronage of St. Amphibalus, was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/14357c.htm">St. Swithin</a>. It occupied the site of an earlier edifice <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the Roman occupation, which had been converted into a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> temple by the Saxons.

<p>A new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built by Cynegils, and three hundred years later was enlarged by Bishop Aethelwald, who replaced the secular canons by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and built a large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. After the conquest the first Norman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Walkelin, built a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> n the Norman style on a site near by; much of his work remains in the present edifice. To this new building (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1093) the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/14357c.htm">St. Swithin</a> were solemnly transferred, 15 July. Within its walls took place the burial of William Rufus (1100), the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard I</a> (1194), the marriage of Henry IV (1401), and the marriage of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> (1554). During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the building was gradually transformed from Norman to Gothic; the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> especially affords an interesting example of the way in which such changes were effected. This work, began by Edington, was continued by the great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/15641a.htm">William of Wykeham</a>, and his successors. In 1378 Wykeham obtained the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> license of the foundation of his great <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Winchester, and in 1387 he began the buildings which were opened in 1393. The original foundation provided for a warden, ten fellows, three <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, seventy scholars, and sixteen choristers.
