<h1>Ancient See of York</h1>  

<p>(EBORACENSIS).

<p>The seat of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> for the northern province. It is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when or how <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> first reached York, but there was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> there from very early times, though there is a break in the historical continuity between these early <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of a later date. At the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (314) "Eborus episcopus de civitate Eboracensis" was present, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of York ere also present at the Councils of <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Nicaea</a>, <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Ariminum</a>. But this early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community was blotted out by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Saxons leaving no trace except the names of three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Sampson, Pyramus, and Theodicus, handed down by legendary tradition. When <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> sent St. Augustine to convert the Saxons his intention was to create two archbishoprics &#151; Canterbury and York &#151; each with twelve suffragans, but this plan was never carried into effect, and though <a href="../cathen/11585a.htm">St. Paulinus</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of York in 625, received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> in 631, he never had any suffragans, nor did his successors receive the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> until 732, when it was granted to Egbert. After the flight of Paulinus in 633 the country relapsed into <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a>, and though its conversion was once more effected by the Celtic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, there was no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of York till the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> in 664. His immediate successors seem to have acted simply as <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> till the time of Egbert, the brother of King Edbert of Northumbria, who received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a> in 735 and established <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the north.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was at first vague and of varying extent. Till the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> invasion the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> occasionally exercised authority, and it was not till the Norman Conquest that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of York asserted their complete independence. At that time they had <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Lindsey, and Lincoln, as well as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the Northern Isles and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. But the first three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> just mentioned were taken from York in 1072. In 1154 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of Man and Orkney were transferred to the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Drontheim, and in 1188 all the Scottish <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> except Whithern were released from subjection to York, so that Whithern, <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, and Carlisle remained to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> as suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Of these, Durham was practically independent, for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of that see were little short of sovereigns in their own <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. During the fourteenth century Whithern was reunited to the Scottish Church, but the province of York received some compensations in the restoration of <a href="../cathen/14130b.htm">Sodor and Man</a>. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> York thus possessed three suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, <a href="../cathen/03349b.htm">Carlisle</a>, and Sodor and Man, to which during the brief space of <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary's</a> reign (1553-58) may be added the <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Diocese of Chester</a>, schismatically founded by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, but subsequently recognized by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>The mutual relations between Canterbury and York were frequently embittered by a long struggle for precedence. In 1071 the question was argued at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> between <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> and Thomas in the presence of <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Pope Alexander II</a>, who decided in favour of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. At a subsequent synod that the future <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of York must be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Canterbury <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and swear allegiance to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and that the Humber was to be the southern limit of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of York. This arrangement lasted till 1118, when Thurstan, archbishop-elect, refused to make submission, and in consequence the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> declined to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> him. Thurstan thereupon successfully appealed to <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Calixtus II</a>, who not only himself <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him, but also gave him a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> releasing him and his successors from the supremacy of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. From time to time during the reign of Henry II and succeeding kings the quarrel broke out again, leading often to <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> scenes of dissension, until <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> (1352-62) settled it by confirming an arrangement that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> should take precedence with the title <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of All <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of York should retain the style of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Each <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was to carry his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> cross in the province of the other, and if they were together their cross-bearers should walk abreast. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of York also undertook that each of his successors should send an image of gold to the shrine of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> history of York apart from its <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> presents few features calling for special remark. For its early memories connected with its founders <a href="../cathen/11585a.htm">St. Paulinus</a> and <a href="../cathen/05323b.htm">St. Edwin</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> on the spot where the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> now stands, its <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> St. Bosa, <a href="../cathen/08469b.htm">St. John of Beverley</a>, and St. Oswald, its great scholars Archbishop Egbert and Aleuin, reference should be made to the articles dealing with those <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> names. At the Conquest it was Archbishop Ealdred who <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/15642c.htm">William I</a> at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, but his successor, Thomas of <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>, the first Norman <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, found everything in confusion; the minster with its great <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was in a ruinous condition, abandoned by almost all its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The celebrated <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> had perished and the city itself had been devastated in the final Northumbrian rebellion against William. Thomas had to begin everything afresh. The pontificate of St. William gave another saint to York, and in 1284 his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were solemnly enshrined there. With John de Thoresby (1352-73) a much needed period of reform began, and he began the present choir of the minster. Another popular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was Richard Scrope, beheaded for his share in the rebellion of the Percys against Henry IV. After his death he was the object of extraordinary veneration by the people. Many of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> besides Thoresby and Scrope &#151; Fitzalan, Lawrence Booth, Scot, among them &#151; held the office of lord chancellor and played leading parts in affairs of state. As Heylyn wrote: "This see has yielded to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> eight <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, to the realm of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> twelve Lord Chancellors and two Lord Treasurers, and to the north of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> two Lord Presidents."



<p>The following is the list of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of York, but there is great difficulty in determining the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> before the Norman Conquest and there is no agreement on the subject. The dates of accession given below are based on the recent researches of Searle, but those earlier than the tenth century can only be regarded in most cases as approximate: <ul> <li>St. Caedda; <li>St. Wilfrid, 664-678; <li>Bosa, 678; <li>St. Wilfrid (restored), 686; <li>Bosa (restored), 691; <li><a href="../cathen/08469b.htm">St. John of Beverley</a>, 705; <li>Wilfrid II, 718; <li>St. Egbert, 732 or 734; <li>&AElig;thelbeorht (Albert), 767; <li>Eanbald I, 780; <li>Eanbald II, 796; <li>Wulfsige, after 808; <li>Wigmund, 837; <li>Wulfhere, 854; <li>&AElig;thelbeald, 900; <li>Hrothweard (Lodeward or Redwald), uncertain; <li>Wulfstan I, 931; <li>Oseytel, 956; <li>Eadwald, 971; <li>St. Oswald, 972; <li>Ealdwulf, 992; <li>Wulfstan II, 1003; <li>&AElig;lfric Puttoc, 1023; <li>&AElig;lthrie, 1041; <li>&AElig;lfric Puttoc, 1042; <li>Cynesige (Kinsy), 1051; <li>Ealdred, 1061; <li>Thomas of <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>, 1070; <li><a href="../cathen/06466b.htm">Gerard</a>, 1101; <li>Thomas II, 1108; <li>Thurstan, 1114; <li><em>vacancy</em>, 1140; <li>St. William, 1143; <li>Mordac, 1147; <li>St. William (restored), 1153; <li>Roger de Pont l'Ev&eacute;que, 1154; <li><em>vacancy</em>, 1181; <li>Geoffrey, 1191; <li><em>vacancy</em>, 1212; <li>Walter de Grey, 1216; <li>Sewal de Bovill, 1256; <li>Geoffrey of Ludham, 1258; <li>Walter Giffard, 1266; <li>William of Wickwaine, 1279; <li>John de Romeyn, 1286; <li><em>vacancy</em>, 1296; <li>Henry of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, 1298; <li>Thomas of Corbridge, 1300; <li><em>vacancy</em>, 1304; <li>William Greenfield, 1306; <li><em>vacancy</em>, 1315; <li>William de Melton, 1317; <li><em>vacancy</em>, 1340; <li>William la Zouch, 1342; <li>John of Thoresby, 1352; <li>Alexander Neville, 1374; <li>Thomas Fitzalan, 1388; <li>Ralph Waldby, 1397; <li>Richard Scrope, 1398; <li><em>vacancy</em>, 1405; <li>Henry Bowet, 1407; <li><em>vacancy</em>, 1423; <li><a href="../cathen/08616b.htm">John Kemp</a> (<a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>), 1426; <li>William Booth, 1452; <li>George Neville, 1464; <li>Lawrence Booth, 1476; <li>Thomas Scot (de Rotherham), 1480; <li>Thomas Savage, 1501; <li>Christopher Bainbridge (<a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>), 1508; <li><a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Thomas Wolsey</a> (<a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>), 1514; <li>Edward Lee, 1531; <li><em>vacancy</em> during which Robert Holgate was schismatically intruded, 1544-55; <li>Nicholas Heath, the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of York, 1555-79.</ul> The minster occupies the site of the church built by <a href="../cathen/05323b.htm">St. Edwin</a>, which as restored by Archbishop Albert was described by <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> as "a most magnificent basilica". This perished in the rebellion of 1069. It was rebuilt by Thomas of <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>, but few portions of this Norman building now remain. The chief features of the existing building are the Early <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> with the lancet windows known as the Five Sisters (late twelfth and early thirteenth century) and the west front (early fourteenth century), usually regarded as the finest in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>, containing splendid examples of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> glass, are of the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; the Lady <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and choir, the latter containing one of the finest perpendicular windows in the world, were fourteenth-century work. The towers were added during the following century, and the completed <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was reconsecrated on 3 February, 1472.

<p>The diocese, which consisted of the counties of York and Nottingham, was divided into four archdeaconries &#151; York, <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, East Riding, and Nottingham &#151; and contained 541 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, which were very numerous, included at the time of the <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">Dissolution</a> (1536-39) 28 <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, 26 <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a>, 23 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, 30 friaries, 13 cells, 4 commanderies of <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Knights Hospitallers</a>, and formerly there had been 4 commanderies of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templar.</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> included some of the largest and most famous in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> at York itself, <a href="../cathen/15609b.htm">Whitby</a>, and Selby; Bolton Abbey, belonging to the Augustinians, and the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> at <a href="../cathen/06161a.htm">Fountains</a>, Rivaulx, Jervaulx, Sawley, and Kirkstall. The churches of York itself were remarkable for their beauty and size. Ripon and Beverley possessed large collegiate churches, and many of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches in the diocese were noted for their size and <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> features. The <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">arms</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> originally were: <blockquote> gules, a <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> argent charged with four crosses formee fitche, sable, edged and fringed or. </blockquote>

<p>But subsequently another coat was used: <blockquote> gules, two keys in saltire argent, in chief a <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> or. </blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> have, fitly enough, substituted a royal crown for the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>. The city of York itself after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> became endeared to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for two reasons, one being the large number of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who suffered at the local Tyburn, the other being the establishment in 1680 of the celebrated Bar Convent founded outside Micklegate Bar by the English Virgins, now the <a href="../cathen/08054a.htm">Institute of Mary</a> (Loreto Nuns). This community, which still carries on one of the most noted <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, has the distinction of being the oldest <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> now in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
