<h1>Andrea Castagno</h1>  

<p>(Or ANDREINO DEL CASTAGNO)

<p>Florentine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. near <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1390; d. at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 9 August, 1457. Little is known of his life. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> tells us that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was only a poor labourer and that the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> himself commenced life as a keeper of cattle. It is not known what led him to study art, or who was his first master. In 1434, after the return of the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a>, he was given a commission to commemorate in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the palace the execution of the Albizzi, the <a href="../cathen/11738a.htm">Peruzzi</a>, etc. From that time he went by the name of "Andrea degli Impiccati". In 1454 <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas V</a> commissioned him to decorate the apartments of the Vatican. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> recounts that Andrea, having learned the secret of oil-painting from Domenico Veneziano, and wishing to remain the sole master of the art, assassinated his comrade. It is known, however, that Domenico survived him four years. Castagno is one of the artists who, with <a href="../cathen/15117c.htm">Paolo Uccello</a> (b. 1497) and <a href="../cathen/09278a.htm">Filippo Lippi</a> (b. 1406), contributed most actively to the <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio</a> revolution in art. His works, however, show the influence of the frescoes of the <a href="../cathen/02737a.htm">Brancacci's</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. He was greatly influenced also by the work of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a>. He has neither the passion of the latter, nor the moral grandeur of <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio</a>, nor the elegance of <a href="../cathen/09278a.htm">Lippi</a>. But in his own domain, which is the perfecting of plastic and of the resources of drawing, no one has made more progress than he. His <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> have been scattered and cannot be studied anywhere but in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. The most celebrated of his works is the life-like and strongly-executed equestrian portrait of <a href="../cathen/11065a.htm">Niccol&ograve; da Tolentino</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Florence, which forms the pendant to that of John Hawkwood by <a href="../cathen/15117c.htm">Uccello</a> (1436). Most remarkable is the "Last Supper", which hangs in the refectory of the old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of S. Appolonia. The figures, almost colossal, have a power of <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>, an individuality, a savage life which forces one to forget the absence of all religious emotion. Such characteristics are also found in the frescoes of the Villa Carducci, which are now at the National Museum. They represent Thomyris, Esther, and the Cumaean Sibyl, the poets <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02607a.htm">Boccaccio</a>, statesmen such as Acciaiuoli, Farinata degli Uberti, and Pippo Spano. These last, by the energy of their attitude, the hang of their draperies, and their heroic aspect, produce an impression of grandeur and solemnity which is found nowhere in the Florentine <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the fourteenth century outside of the works of <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio</a> and <a href="../cathen/13787a.htm">Signorelli</a>.
