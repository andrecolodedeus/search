<h1>Andrea Cesalpino</h1>  

<p>(Caesalpinus).

<p>A physician, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and naturalist, distinguished above all as a botanist; born at <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a> in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 6 June, 1519; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 23 February, 1603. For his studies at the <a href="../cathen/12112a.htm">University of Pisa</a> his instructor in medicine was R. Colombo (d. 1559), and in botany the celebrated Luca Ghini (d. 1556). After completing his course he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, medicine, and botany for many years at the same <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, besides making botanical explorations in various parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. At this time the first botanical gardens in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> were laid out; the earliest at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, in 1546; the next at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> in 1547 by Ghini, who was its first director. Ghini was succeeded by Cesalpino, who had charge of the Pisan garden 1554-1558. When far advanced in years Cesalpino accepted a call to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as professor of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> at the Sapienza and physician to <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a>. It is not positively certain whether he also become the chief superintendent of the Roman botanical garden which had been laid out about 1566 by one of his most celebrated pupils, Michele Mercati (1541-1593). All of Cesalpino's writings show the man of genius and the profound thinker. His style, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is often heavy, yet in spite of the scholastic form in which his works are cast, passages of great beauty often occur. Modern botanists and physiologists who are not acquainted with the writings of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> find Cesalpino's books obscure; their failure to comprehend them has frequently misled them in their judgment of his achievement. No comprehensive summing up of the results of Cesalpino's investigations, founded on a critical study of all his works has appeared, neither has there been a complete edition of his writings. Seven of these are positively known, and most of the seven have been printed several times, although none have appeared since the seventeenth century. In the following list the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of publication given is that of the first edition. His most important <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> work is "Quaestionum peripateticarum libri V" (Florence, 1569). Cesalpino proves himself in this to be one of the most eminent and original students of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> in the sixteenth century. His writings, however, show traces of the influence of <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>, hence he is an <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroistic</a> <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a>; apparently he was also inclined to <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, consequently he was included, later, in the Spinozists before <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a>. A <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> opponent of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> views, Nicholas Taurellus (d. 1606, at Altdorf), who is called "the first German philosopher", wrote several times against Cesalpino. The work of Taurellus entitled "Alpes caesae", etc. (Frankfort, 1597), is entirely devoted to combating the opinions of Cesalpino, as the play on the name Caesalpinus shows. Nearly one hundred years later Cesalpino's views were again attacked, this time by an Englishman, Samuel Parker (d.1688), in a work entitled: "Disputationes de Deo et providenti&acirc; divin&acirc;" (London, 1678).

<p>Cesalpino repeatedly asserted the steadfastness of his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles and his readiness to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> of any <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> opinions expounded by him as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which should be contrary to revelation. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he was in high favour both with the secular and spiritual rulers. Cesalpino's physiological investigations concerning the circulation of the blood are well known, but even up to the present time they have been as often overestimated as undervalued. An examination of the various passages in his writings which bear upon the question shows that although it must be said that Celsalpino had penetrated further into the secret of circulation of the blood than any other physiologist before William Harvey, still he had not attained to a thorough <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, founded on anatomical research, of the entire course of the blood. Besides the work "Qu&aelig;stionum peripateticarum" already mentioned, reference should be made to "Quaestionum medicarum libri duo" (Venice, 1593), and to his most important publication "De plantis libri XVI" (Florence, 1583). This last work has made Cesalpino <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of its publication, 1583, is one of the most important in the history of botany before Linnaeus. The permission to print the book is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 September, 1581. The work is dedicated to the Grand Duke Francesco de Medici; including dedication and the indexes, it contains some 670 quarto pages, of which 621 are taken up with the text proper. Unlike the "herbals" of that period, it contains no illustrations. The first section, including thirty pages of the work, is the part of most importance for botany in general. From the beginning of the seventeenth century up to the present day botanists have agreed in the opinion that Cesalpino in this work, in which he took <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> for his guide, laid the foundation of the morphology and physiology of plants and produced the first scientific classification of flowering plants. Three things, above all, give the book the stamp of individuality: the large number of original, acute observations, especially on flowers, fruits, and seeds, made, moreover, before the discovery of the microscope, the selection of the organs of fructification for the foundation of his botanical system; finally, the ingenious and at the same time strictly <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> handling of the rich material gathered by observation. Cesalpino issued a publication supplementary to this work, entitled: "Appendix ad libros de plantis et quaestiones peripateticas" (Rome, 1603). Cesalpino is also famous the history of botany as one of the first botanists to make a herbarium; one of the oldest herbaria still in existence is that which he arranged about 1550-60 for Bishop Alfonso Tornabono. After many changes of fortune the herbarium is now in the museum of natural history at Florence. It consists of 260 folio pages arranged in three volumes bound in red leather, and contains 768 varieties of plants. A work of some value for chemistry, mineralogy, and geology was issued by him under the title: "De metallicis libri tres" (Rome, 1596). Some of its matter recalls the discoveries made at the end of the eighteenth century, as those of <a href="../cathen/09052a.htm">Lavoisier</a> and Hauy, it also shows a correct understanding of fossils. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Karl Plumier (d. 1704), gave the name of Cesalpinia to a species of plants and Linnaeus retained it in his system. At the present day this species includes not over forty varieties and belongs to the sub-order Caesalpinioideae (<a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> Leguminosae), which contains a large number of useful plants. Linnaeus in his writings often quotes his great predecessor in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of botany and praises Cesalpino in the following lines: <blockquote> Quisquis hic exstiterit primos concedat honores <br>Casalpine Tibi primaque certa dabit. </blockquote>
