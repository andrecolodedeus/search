<h1>Andrea Palladio</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architect</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> 1508; died at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 19 August, 1580. There is a tradition that he was the son of a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> carpenter, with no surname of his own, and that the famous <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> poet, <a href="../cathen/15061a.htm">Gian Giorgio Trissino</a>, became his patron and gave him the name of Palladio, in fanciful allusion to Pallas, the <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greek</a> goddess of wisdom. After a brief apprenticeship as <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> he travelled and studied the remains of classical architecture, endeavouring to determine its principles by the aid of Vitruvius's writings. The results of these studies appear in the buildings which he constructed, of which the earliest known is the Palazzo Godi at Lonedo (1540). The execution of his design for the rebuilding of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> in his native town was commenced in 1549. The <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnades</a> of this <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> are his most famous work. His Arco di Trionfo, also at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, is even now the best modern imitation of a Roman triumphal arch. A fine sense of proportion, combined with scholarly refinement and fertility of invention, characterizes the palaces of <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, where Palladio had a free hand. He was a favourite of society in and about <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, and was therefore a most prolific designer of villas. Few of these were ever completed, many have been changed or dismantled, and nearly all have lost the environment of gardens and accessories which were a necessary part of the composition. All are, however, stately, spacious and airy, effective in mass, dignified in detail, and free from affectation. Two standard types are the Villa Capra, in the environs of <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, and the Villa Giacomelli at <a href="../cathen/15038a.htm">Treviso</a>.

<p>Only three <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">sacred buildings</a> are surely his work, the small <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> near the last-named villa and the churches of San Giorgio (1565) and Il Redentore (begun, 1576, finished after his death) at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. These two churches are cruciform with <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">crossing-domes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apsidal</a> terminations to <a href="../cathen/03693a.htm">choirs</a> and <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a>. The interiors are cold, powerful, and spacious; the exteriors are frankly structural of inferior materials, with semi-circular, lead-covered <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">domes</a>, and with no ornamentation except in the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">facades</a>.

<p>Palladio may be taken as the representative of a wholesome reaction against the decadent tendencies of his age, and may be said to have fixed good <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> style for many succeeding centuries. Although in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> a more meretricious taste prevailed, represented by <a href="../cathen/09190c.htm">Lescaut</a> and by <a href="../cathen/11321a.htm">De l'Orme</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08500b.htm">Inigo Jones</a>, Palladio became so much the controlling spirit that the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> style of the seventeenth century is now known as "Palladian". Naturally, the Georgian architecture of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> develops directly from Palladio through the later masters who followed <a href="../cathen/08500b.htm">Inigo Jones</a>. Palladio's writings, particularly "Le Antichit&agrave; di Roma" and the "Quattro Libri dell' Architettura", did more than anything else to spread his influence over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>: many editions were published in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> between 1554 and 1642. They were widely translated, and in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> <a href="../cathen/08500b.htm">Inigo Jones</a> acted as editor and commentator.
