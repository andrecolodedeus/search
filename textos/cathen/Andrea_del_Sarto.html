<h1>Andrea del Sarto</h1>  

<p>(ANDREA D'AGNOLO)

<p>Born at Florence in 1486; d. there in 1531. He received the surname Sarto from the fact that he was the son of a tailor. At first he was the pupil of an obscure master, G. Barile, but in 1498 he entered the studio of Piero di Cosimo. He visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a short time. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> says, that had he remained there long enough to study its masterpieces, he would have "surpassed all the artists of his day." Naturally diffident, he felt himself a stranger there, and hastened to return to Florence. Despite his brief career, he produced a large number of frescoes and easel pictures. In 1509 he began the fresco decoration of the little <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of the Annunziata, connected with the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Florence. He depicted five scenes from the life of St. Philip Benizi, General of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>: "His Charity to a Leper"; "The Smiting of the Blasphemers"; "The Cure of the Woman Possessed with a Devil"; "The Resurrection of Two Children near the Tomb of the Saint"; "The Veneration of his Relics." Later he added the "Adoration of the Magi" (1511) and the "Nativity of the Virgin" (1514). In 1525, by way of farewell, he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> the masterpiece, "The Madonna of the Sack," so called because in it St. Joseph is represented leaning against a sack. In 1514, in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of the Scalzo, he executed a series of ten frescoes, recounting the history of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>. Four allegorical figures, Faith, Hope, Charity, and Justice, complete the decorative cycle. The influence of Albrecht Duerer has been traced in several, but that of <a href="../cathen/06545a.htm">Ghirlandajo</a> has been recognized in this as well as in the preceding cycle, though here Andrea displays a more original bent. In Poggio's villa at Cajano he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the fresco (1521), "Caesar receiving the Tribute of the Animal World," by way of complimenting the zoological tastes of Lorenzo the Magnificent. The work was finished in 1582 by <a href="../cathen/01325d.htm">Al. Allori</a>. A beautifully executed series of figures, especially those of Sts. Agnes, Catherine, and Margaret, were <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> (1524) in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. His last fresco, "The Last Supper," was done for the refectory in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of San Salvi, at the gates of Florence. Here Andrea drew his inspiration from <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. The beautiful work shows lively and varied colouring, but lacks the perfection of drawing and especially the dramatic quality of the "Last Supper" of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>.

<p>His principal pictures are: at the Pitti Palace, "The Annunciation" (1513); "Madonna with Sts. Francis and John the Evangelist" (1517); "Disputation concerning the Trinity" (1517), a very careful <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in which the artist "comes closest to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> expression" (Burckhardt); "Descent from the Cross" (1524); "Madonna with four saints" (1524); "The Assumption" (1526), of which there are two variations; at the Uffizi "Madonna of the Harpies, with St. Francis and St. John" (1517), so called because of the decorations on the pedestal on which the Blessed Virgin stands with the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in her arms; at the Museum of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, "The Virgin with Saints" (1528); in the Dresden Gallery, "The Sacrifice of Abraham"; "The Marriage of St. Catherine"; at the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, "Madonna between Sts. Catherine and Elizabeth"; at the Museum of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, "The Pieta" (1517); at the Louvre, "The Virgin with the Infant Jesus, St. Elizabeth and St. John," which is an imitation of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> "Madonna Canigiani"; "Charity." These two pictures were purchased by <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">King of France</a> was charmed with his talent and induced him to come to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. His portrait of the dauphin and "Charity" must have been <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> during his stay at the court. Obtaining permission to visit Florence, he departed, with money to collect works of art for <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>; but, being of weak character and dominated by his wife, a beautiful and unscrupulous coquette, he squandered the money and did not return to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He has left several portraits of himself (Pitti Palace, Uffizi, and National Gallery). Andrea del Sarto owes much to <a href="../cathen/02318a.htm">Fra Bartolommeo</a>, borrowing from him the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> arrangement of his compositions as in "Charity" of the Louvre, where triangle grouping is used. Andrea was above all a colourist, "the greatest colourist of the sixteenth century, in the region south of the Apennines" (Burckhardt). In this also he resembles Bartolommeo but shows more care for chiaroscuro. Like <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a> he excels in <em>sfumato</em>. His drawings, many of which are preserved at the Uffizi and the Louvre, are characterized by a melting softness which recalls Correggio's delicate execution, but this excessive <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of colour led him to neglect the superior beauty of expression; his pictures lack conviction and character. Not understanding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character which each face should express, he usually confines himself to repeating the same type of Madonnas and Infant Christs, and thus produces an effect of coldness and artificiality.
