<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Andrea del Verrocchio</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1435; d. at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1488. He was called Andrea di Michele di Francesco de' Cioni, but for his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> name he substituted that of his master, the goldsmith Giuliano Verrocchio. Some authorities hold that the frequented the studies of <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a> and <a href="../cathen/02219c.htm">Baldovinetti</a>, but in any case the impress of his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> with a goldsmith is strongly evident in his work. He always retained a very keen taste for delicate chasing, which taste is especially manifested in the equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Colleoni, wherein the horse's head and the harness are chased like a piece of jewellery. He excelled in depicting the charms of children and womanly grace. Nevertheless he was not married, but lived in the household of a married sister, who had many children. Although favoured with the friendship of Lorenzo de' Medici, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with important commissions, and reputed the greatest artist of his time, he seems never to have known the favours of fortune. His art, which often shone with a radiantly smiling beauty, seems to have been the reflection of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and cheerful life. He was both <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, but chiefly the latter.

<p>His chief sculptural works were: the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Piero and Giovanni de' Medici, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Lorenzo, in marble and bronze, without religious emblem. His "David" in bronze was in the national museum (the Bargello), Florence. The "Child holding a dolphin", in bronze, made to adorn a fountain of the Villa Medici at Careggi, is in the courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence. These three works were ordered from Verrocchio by Lorenzo the Magnificent. In the terra-cotta "Madonna" made for the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Novella "supreme distinction of thought is united to the most scrupulous observation of nature" (A. Michel). The marble bust of the "Flower-girl" is in the Bargello. The silver <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-relief</a> of the "Decollation of St. John the Baptist", which adorned the altar of the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of San Giovanni, is preserved n the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> museum (Opera del Duomo), Florence. The marble monument erected in memory of Cardinal Fortteguera in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Pistoia was designed by Verrocchio but executed by his pupils.

<p>His two masterpieces, both in bronze, were the "Incredulity of St. Thomas" (1483) and the "Colleone" (1479-88). The first group, wherein the artist has touchingly represented <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> urging the doubting Apostle to put his hand in His pierced side, was ordered by the Council of Merchants and placed outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Michele, in a beautiful niche made by <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a>. But Verrocchio <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in making so much of the draperies, for this exaggerated realism greatly distracts the attention from a subject so pathetic in itself. The second work was the splendid equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> which the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a> ordered to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the memory of the celebrated <em>condottiere</em>, Bartolommeo Colleoni of <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, who had commanded the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> troops. While casting it Verrocchio was seized with a chill, which ended fatally. The statute was completed by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Alessandro Leopardi, who had the audacity to sign a work of which he had only finished the casting and perfected the details. The statute was not erected until 1495; it is still to be seen on the Piazza dei Santi Giovanni e Paolo. Assuredly, "we have a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to say that this equestrian statute is the finest in the world" (J. Burckhardt).

<p>Only two <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> can with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> be assigned to Verrocchio, the "Baptism of Christ", which was made for the Convent of San Salvi at the gates of Florence, and which is now at the Academy of Fine Arts n the same city; and the "Madonna" of the Duomo of Pistoia, long ascribed to <a href="../cathen/04476b.htm">Lorenzo di Credi</a>, on the word of <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, but which a document published by Signor Chiti assigns to Verrocchio. The "Baptism" (c. 1470) is an oil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, at that time still a great novelty in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. Accordingly, it shows traces of grouping and experiment. Its different parts are of unequal value, which led <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> to assert boldly that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> respectfully guarding the garments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is by <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. It is more perfect than the other figures in the picture. The "Baptism" marked an epoch in the history of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, because the accuracy of design and the refinement of the model were an innovation whereby Verrocchio broke with the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the frescoists, less correct and broader in execution. But these technical studies, so evident especially in the angular figure of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John Baptist</a>, explain why <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> called Verrocchio's manner "alquanto dura e crudetta". The perfection of the landscape which forms the background of the picture foreshadows modern art, because "for the first time the artist gives attentive observance to the study of values, the gradation of colours, especially to the unity of the figures with the environment" (M. Raymond). This "somewhat rough and crude" manner disappears in the "Madonna" of Pistoia. This delightful composition represents the Blessed Virgin between <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> and <a href="../cathen/15754d.htm">St. Zeno</a>, supporting the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Who lifts His little hand to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a>.

<p>Critics do not agree with regard to the other pictures ascribed to Verrocchio; nevertheless he may be unhesitatingly credited with the beautiful "Annunciation" at the Uffizi, and the graceful "Madonna with the Carnation", in the Old Pinacothek at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. The authorship of the Madonnas at the museums of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> is disputed. Verrocchio was perhaps the greatest artist of the second half of the fifteenth century. On the boundary of two ages, between the old Florentine <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, about to disappear, and the School of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> in course of formation, he was not, like the masters of preceding periods, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> artist, because he rejected the purpose of placing art at the service of a moral and religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>; he was not as yet an artist of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> neglecting the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to study the body, for he did not attempt to imitate antiquity; instead of drawing his inspiration from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> which he has bequeathed to us, and of becoming exclusively enamoured of the plastic beauty of corporeal forms, he preferred to observe living nature, and like his predecessors continued to subordinate form to the expression of the feelings of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but, more skilful than they, he succeeded in perfecting his methods of expression, because his drawing is more correct and his modelling more scientific.

<p>Hence Verrocchio's powerful influence over <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>; his studio was the centre of resistance to the invasion of antique influence; and his pupils <a href="../cathen/04476b.htm">Lorenzo di Credi</a>, <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a> continued to spread the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Florentine School. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> may be summarized as follows: art should be spiritual, that is, it should make form serve the expression of thought and sentiment.
