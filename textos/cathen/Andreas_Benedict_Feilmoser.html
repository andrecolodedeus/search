<h1>Andreas Benedict Feilmoser</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and Biblical scholar, b. 8 April, 1777, at Hopfgarten, Tyrol; d. at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, 20 July, 1831, studied at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> from 1789 to 1794, took a two years' course in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">University of Innsbruck</a> (1794-96), and entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> at Fiecht, Tyrol, in September, 1796. At this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> he studied the Oriental languages under Dom Georg Maurer, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St. George's Abbey, Villingen. For his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies he was sent to Villingen, where he again heard Dom Maurer and <a href="../cathen/09431b.htm">Dom Gottfried Lumper</a>, both eminent scholars. Returning to Fiecht in 1800, he taught <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">Biblical exegesis</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1801; late in the same year he was appointed master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, in 1802 professor of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ethics and in 1803 of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. A number of theses which he published in 1803 aroused the suspicions of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Diocese of Brixen</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fiecht was sharply rebuked for permitting Feilmoser to teach unsound <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. In 1804 appeared Feilmoser's "Animadversiones in historiam ecclesiasticam", which did not meet the approval of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authorities, who threatened, in case Feilmoser did not desist from advancing dangerous opinions, to institute proceedings against the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. To Feilmoser's request for a specification of the objectionable passages in his writings no reply was made, but the entire matter was reported to the emperor at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. An investigation instituted by order of the emperor resulted favourably for Feilmoser. He was, nevertheless, removed from the office of master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and in 1806 was made assistant in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Achenthal. By the Treaty of Presburg (26 Dec., 1805) Tyrol was cut off from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and became a part of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The new Government, in November, 1806, appointed him professor of Oriental languages and of introduction to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> at the <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">University of Innsbruck</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Fiecht having been suppressed in 1807, he left the order. At Innsbruck he received the degree of Doctor of Theology in 1808 and was appointed to the chair of <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. During the Tyrolese insurrection, August, 1809, he, with a number of other professors, was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and carried to Pusterthal by order of Andreas Hofer. In 1810 he returned to <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, in 1811 he was made professor of catechetics, in 1812 of Latin and Greek philology, and in 1817 was reappointed professor of New-Testament <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> in the face of much opposition. About this time the old charges against him were revived, and in 1818 he was bitterly attacked in an anonymous work published at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. He was denied the opportunity of publicly defending himself, inasmuch as the imperial censor at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, on 17 July, 1819, decided that since the anonymous work was published, a foreign country, it was under Austrian censure and must be regarded as non-existent. On 25 April, 1820, he was formally appointed a professor at the <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">University of T&uuml;bingen</a>, where he continued to teach New -Testament <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> until his death.

<p>He wrote: "S&auml;tze aus der christlichen Sittenlehre f&uuml;r die &ouml;ffentliche Pr&uuml;fung in dem Benedictinerstifte zu Fiecht" (Innsbruck, 1803); "S&auml;tze aus der Einleitung in die B&uuml;cher des alten Bundes und den hebraischen Alterhumern" (Innsbruck, 1803); "Animaversiones in historiam ecclesiasticam" (Innsbruck, 1803); "S&auml;tze aus der Einleitung in die B&uuml;cher des neuen Bundes und der bibli. Hermeneutik" (Innsbruck, 1804); "Einleitung in die B&uuml;cher des des neuen Bundes" (Innsbruck, 1810); "Auszug des hebr. Sprachlehre nach Jahn" (Innsburck 1812); "Die Verketzerrungssucht" (Rottweil, 1820). His principal work, "Einleitung in die Bucher des neuen Bundes", published in a revised edition (T&uuml;bingen, 1830), is inaccurate and was praised far beyond its due. He also contributed papers and criticisms to the "Annalen der osterreichischen Litteratur und Kunst" and the "Theologische Quartal-schrift" of T&uuml;bingen. His <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> writings are influenced by the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> spirit of his day. He denied the genuineness of the <em>Comma Johanneum</em> and maintained that the Books of Job, Jonas, Tobias, and Judith are merely didactic poems.
