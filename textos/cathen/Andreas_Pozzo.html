<h1>Andreas Pozzo</h1>  

<p>(P<font size=-2>UTEUS</font>)

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and architect of the Baroque period, b. at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, 1642; d. at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1709. The greater part of his life was spent at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. After his literary studies, he devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, and at twenty-four entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>. After his death he was commemorated by a memoir and a medal. Pozzo was an unrivalled master of perspective; he used light, colour, and an <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> background as means of creating illusion. In the Baroque period, instead of employing panels ornamented with stucco work, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> was used not only to cover the domes and semi-domes but also the ceiling and vaultings. <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> had <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, but <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a> did not follow him in treating the main vaulting of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. It had begun to be customary to fill the sunken panels or large cartouches, and finally the entire vault, as, for example, the domes, with perspective <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in the advanced style of Correggio. <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo's</a> device of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> framework to divide the different portions of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> was no longer in vogue, nor even actual <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> members. Pozzo was a master in this new style of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>; he gives full instruction concerning this method in his manual. His frescoes on the ceiling, <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the church of San Ignazio at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> are greatly admired. By the skilful use of linear perspective, light, and shade, he made the great barrel-vault of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of the church into an idealized aula from which is seen the reception of St. Ignatius into the opened heavens. About the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> there is a wonderful effect of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> majesty, but the whole composition is more a feat of skill than a work of art. Only the Baroque era could regard it as a genuine devotional picture. Pozzo executed a similar work in San Bartolommeo at <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>. In the Abbey of the Cassinese at <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a> and in the Pinacotheca at Bologna the magical effect is produced by the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> perspective alone. Importance is laid on the profiles of the ornamental <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> members, not in the life and movement. According to his theory, columns must be twisted; they can even be bent and cracked. Coloured stones and metals must also aid in securing the pictorial effect. An extraordinary increase in bulk, therefore, would be required to obtain the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> constructive strength. In making the altar for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, he erected for the plastic work of the centre a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of ten columns, with twisted <a href="../cathen/05479b.htm">entablature</a>. He also constructed the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of Gli Scalzi at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. The altar of St. Ignatius in the Ges&ugrave; at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is an example of the greatest magnificence. His manual gives directions for making all kinds of church furniture. Pozzo's decorative work, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> systematized, shows his great talent which perfectly suited the characteristic taste of the period and the pomp then customary in religious services.
