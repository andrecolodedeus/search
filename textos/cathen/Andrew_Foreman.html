<h1>Andrew Foreman</h1>  

<p>A Scottish <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, of good border <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; b. at Hatton, near Berwick-on-Tweed; d. 1522. His talents marked him out for early promotion in his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career; through the influence of King James IV, he soon became a prothonotary Apostolic and was employed on various important missions. The king sent him in 1497 with two other envoys to conclude the truce of Aytoun with Henry VII of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and four years later he was empowered to negotiate for the marriage of King James with King Henry's daughter Margaret. By 1502 Foreman was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Moray (for which see, notwithstanding the protest of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, he procured exemption from the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of St. Andrews); he was also "commendatory" <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> both in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Appointed ambassador to <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in 1509, he was commissioned by his sovereign to try to bring about universal peace with a view to a new <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. King Louis of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, after concluding an alliance with the King of Scots against <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, made Foreman <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, and it was <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Pope Julius II's</a> intention to raise him to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. The successor of Julius, <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, did not carry out this intention, but nominated Foreman in 1514 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of St. Andrews and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere</em>. He received at the same time the <a href="../cathen/05192a.htm">Abbey of Dunfermline</a> <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>, and seems to have held also at one time or another the rich Abbeys of Kilwinning, Dryburgh, and Arbroath. The new <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate's</a> eight years' tenure of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was marked by vigorous administration; and he did much to consolidate the episcopal authority, procuring the restoration to his province of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/05193a.htm">Dunkeld</a> and Dunblane, and holding an important synod, the enactments of which, still extant, throw an important light on the condition of the Scottish Church immediately before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. These <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> testify to the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate's</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the amelioration of the state of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, for the reform of abuses, the advancement of learning, and the augmentation of the solemnity of the services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Archbishop Foreman was buried in <a href="../cathen/05192a.htm">Dunfermline Abbey</a>.
