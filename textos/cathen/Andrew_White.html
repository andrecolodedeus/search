<h1>Andrew White</h1>  

<p>Missionary, b. at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 1579; d. at or near <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 27 Dec., 1656 (O.S.). He entered <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a> College, <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, in 195; later he studied at the English College, <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, matriculated at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> there about 1605; sent on the English Mission, he was seized, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and banished in 1606. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1607 at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>; in 1609 he was back in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, labouring in the southern counties. He taught <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, and Hebrew, and was prefect of studies at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, varying scholastic occupations by occasional missionary trips to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He is principally known to American history for his writings and labours in connection with Lord Baltimore's colony, which have earned for him the title of "Apostle of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>". <a href="../cathen/03192a.htm">Sir George Calvert</a>, first Lord of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, corresponded with him from Avalon; <a href="../cathen/15486d.htm">Father Vitelleschi</a>, General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, makes mention to him, for the first time, of the mission to English America, in a letter date <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 3 March, 1629. In preparation for the founding of the <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Colony he composed the "Declaratio Coloniae Domini Baronis de Baltimore", to attract settlers and co-operators in the enterprise. The expedition set sail on 22 Nov., 1633, from Cowes, Isle of Wight. Father White is the author of the "Relatio itineris", which constitutes the classical authority in regard to early <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. On the Feast of the Annunciation, 25 March, 1634, the "Pilgrims" of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> landed on St. Clement's Island, where <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated for the first time: art has depicted the scene, and "Maryland Day" has been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to patriotic remembrance of the event.

<p>For ten years Father White devoted himself with apostolic <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, patience, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to missionary labours amongst the settlers and the aborigines. A Protest writer (Davis in "Day-Star", p. 160) says: "The history of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> presents no better, no purer, no more sublime lesson than the story of the toils, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and successes of her early missionaries." In contrast with other English colonies, the relations between whites and Indians were harmonious, largely due to Father White. The "Annual Letters" narrate his successful labours amongst the tribes of the Patuxent and Potomac; he carried the Gospel to the Anacostans n the neighbourhood of the nation's capital; he converted and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with solemn ceremonies, 5 July, 1640, Governor Calvert and other civil dignitaries being present, Chitomachon, the <em>Tayac</em> or "Emperor of Piscataway". A graphic representation of this sacred function from Tanner is reproduced in Shea, "Catholic Church in Colonial Days", p. 53. He composed a grammar, dictionary, and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> in the native idiom, being the first Englishman to reduce an Indian language to grammatical form. The claim has been advanced that the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the first printing-press in British America belongs to <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>; but these works were <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> compositions.

<p>The rise of the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> party in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was felt with disastrous effects to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>; a band of marauders from <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a> plundered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> establishments, and Father White, with two companions, was seized and sent in irons to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where he was tried on the charge of treason, as being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> contrary to the statute 27 Elizabeth. He was acquitted on the manifest pleas that he had entered the country under force and much against his will. Banished again, he longed to return to his "dear Marilandians", but his earnest petitions could not be granted, as he was advanced in years and broken by exhausting labours; the remainder of his life was spent quietly in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>The writings of Father White are: (1) "Relatio itineris"; (2) Declaratio Coloniae"; (3) "A Briefe Relation".

<p>(1) "Declaratio iteneris in Marilandiam". Rev. Wm. McSherry, S.J., discovered this Latin narrative of the voyage in the archives of the Domus Professa at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1832. He made a transcript of the document, and brought it to George town College; an abridged translation appeared in the "Catholic Almanac" (Baltimore, 1840), pp. 15-34, and a full translation by N.C. Brooks was printed in Force's "Historical Tracts", pp. 47 (Washington, 1846), IV, 12. The Latin text was printed for the first time with a revised translation in the first volume of "Woodstock Letters" (1872); in 1874 the <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Historical Society published it in Latin and English, Fund Publication, 7 (edited with notes by Dr. E.A. Dalrymple); this version is reprinted verbatim in <a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley</a>, "Records of the English province" (London, 1878), III, 339 sqq., and in Scharf, "History of Maryland" (Baltimore, 1879), I sqq., Hughes, "History of the Society of Jesus in North America" (London, 1908), presents the most authentic text, with a facsimile photographic reproduction of the first page of the original (Documents, I, pt. I, 94-107); in the same history (Text, I, 274-9) he gives an epitome of the "Relation", discusses its authorship and authenticity, and furnishes exhaustive biographical information concerning Father White, who wrote this account to the general of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, from St. Mary's in 1634, within a month of the landing.

<p>(2) "Declaratio Coloniae Domini Baronis de Baltimore": composed by Father White, revised and published, with "Conditions of Plantation", by <a href="../cathen/03193a.htm">Cecilius Calvert</a>. "Woodstock Letters" (Latin and English)m, I, 12-21; <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Historical Society (Fund Publication, 7), <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 1874 (Latin and English); Force and <a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley</a> (pp. 329-334), ut supra; Hughes, Documents, I, 145-148 (Latin), Text, I, 249-253; Hall, "Narratives of Early Maryland" (New York, 1910), 5-10.

<p>(3) "A Briefe Relation of the Voyage unto <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>". The substance of this was printed in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 1634, and reprinted in 1865, Shea, "Early Southern Tracts", no. 1. It was composed by Father White, and authenticated by <a href="../cathen/03194b.htm">Governor Leonard Calvert</a> in a letter from Point Comfort, May, 1634, as the work of a "most honest and discreet gentlemen". <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Historical Society, Fund Publication, 35, Calvert Papers, no. 3 (Baltimore, 1899), 26-46- discussion of authorship, pp. 6-12; Notes by Father Hughes: Hall, "Narratives of Early Maryland" (New York, 1910), 29-45.
