<h1>Andr&eacute;-Hercule de Fleury</h1>  

<p>Born at Lod&egrave;ve, 26 June, 1653; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 29 January, 1742. He was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Cardinal de Bonzi and become <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> in 16790, and to <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> in 1683. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a> in 1698, but resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1715, when he received the Abbey of Tournus and was appointed tutor to the young Louis XV. Naturally cold and imperturbable, he remained in the background during the regency. When Louis XV attained his majority in 1723, it was at the instance of Fleury that the Duc de Bourbon was made prime minister, and quarrelling with the Duke, Fleury pretended to retire to Issy. Louis XV, however, who admired and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> his tutor, sent the Duke into exile, and entrusted the government to Fleury. True to his habits of discretion, and accustomed, as Duclos says, "to bridle the envious", he never assumed the title of prime minister. He was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in September, 1726, and until his death remained the guiding spirit in French politics.

<p>Comparing the three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, d'Argenson said: "Richelieu bled <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> purged it, and Fleury put it on a diet". He alluded in this bantering way to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> policy of economy which, among other drawbacks, retarded the development of the French military marine at the very period when the mercantile marine, thanks to private enterprise, was making considerable progress. In spite of this, Fluery had the qualities of a great minister. He was the first to foresee that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> would not always be at enmity with the Hapsburghs. In connection with the Polish succession and the Duchy of Lorraine, he availed himself of the best advice of the diplomat Chauvelin, when it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to play a cautious game with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. But, as <a href="../cathen/15268a.htm">Vandal</a> says, the policy of Chauvelin was that of the past. Fleury, in redoubling his efforts to bring about as quickly as possible pleasant relations between the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the emperor, was the precursor of Choisuel, Vergennes, and Talleyrand. He was accused of timidity when, at the outbreak of the War of Austrian Succession he wrote a letter to General K&ouml;nigseck, in which he seemed to apologize for this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. But, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Fleury was simply anticipating the policy of the <em>renversement des alliances</em> (breaking up of the alliances), which began in 1756, and which by uniting <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was to be more in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> traditions of both countries. The opinions of historians like <a href="../cathen/15268a.htm">Vandal</a> and Masson with regard to this <em>renversement des alliances</em>, so long the object of criticism, tends to justify Cardinal Fleury.

<p>During the period of Fleury's power, <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> was gaining ground among the masses as a <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, as is evidenced by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> P&acirc;ris, while among the upper classes it took shape as a political faction. Fleury was the minister who had to contend with a <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> opposition in the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He reserved to royal authority all matters relating to <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, one consequence of which was a "strike" on the part of the magistrates and lawyers, which Fleury suppressed with certain measures of severity. He became a member of the Academy in 1717 and was the first to propose sending a scientific expedition to the far north and to <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> to measure the degrees of the meridian.
