<h1>Andr&eacute; Terrasson</h1>  

<p>A French preacher, born at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1669; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 25 April, 1723. He was the eldest son of a councillor of the Lyons presidial (court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>). Entering the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Congregation of the Oratory</a> he devoted himself to preaching, and winning high reputation was called to fill important <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a>. He preached the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons of 1717 before <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, next at the Court of Lorraine, and later twice in the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> with considerable success; the last of these series broke down his health and led to his death. His eloquent diction, which was enhanced by his outward action, was marked by nobility and simplicity of thought, by forcefulness and absence of artificiality. His good judgment led him to avoid mere brilliancy of expression and clever artifices of speech but he was sometimes cold, perhaps as a result of his <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> proclivities. About fifty of his discourses, mostly delivered as <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> lectures, are preserved, and were published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (4 vols., 1726, 1736).

<p>GASPARD, brother of the preceding, born at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, Oct., 1680; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 2 Jan., 1752. He was also a member of the Oratory, teaching humanities and afterwards philosophy. His oratorical gifts were revealed at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, 1711, on delivering the funeral oration of the Dauphin, son of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>; but he did not devote himself to the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> till after his brother's death, when he fulfilled several engagements which the latter had made. Soon his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> increased beyond that of Andr&eacute;. For five years he preached at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and finally delivered a <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> course in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Notre Dame. More stubborn even than his brother, he appealed time after time against the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>; he even published anonymously twelve "Lettres sur la justice chr&eacute;tienne" (Paris, 1733), in which, to support the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> deprived of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, he endeavoured to prove the inutility of sacramental confession. This work was condemned by the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1 Sept., 1734), and by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> and Embrun, as containing <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> assertions. Terrasson had to leave the Oratory and abandon preaching. He withdrew to the Diocese of Auxerre where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, M. de Caylus, a well-known <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>, confided to him the care of Treigni. But he was soon arrested (Oct., 1735) by the order of the king for his <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> activities, and was confined during nine years either at Vincennes or with the Minims of Argenteuil. A belated retractation, the authenticity or sincerity of which has never been well established, was attributed to him. He was living in retirement with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> when he died. As a preacher his chief characteristics are simplicity and clearness, but at times he carries the subdivision of his matter to excess; his style is somewhat dry and lacks vigour. Like his brother he holds a high place among the orators of second rank. A volume of his discourses appeared at <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> in 1733, but the first real edition was at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1744 (4 vols.). The sermons of the two brothers were reprinted by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> in his "Collection des orateurs sacr&eacute;s", XXIX (Paris, 1849).
