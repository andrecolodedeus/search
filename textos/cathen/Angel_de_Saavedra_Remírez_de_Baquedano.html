<h1>Angel de Saavedra Rem&iacute;rez de Baquedano</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> poet and statesman, b. at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, 10 March, 1791; d. at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 22 June, 1865. He was the second son of Juan Mart&iacute;n de Saavedra, Duque de Rivas, and succeeded to the title upon the death without issue of his elder brother in 1834. At eleven he entered the Seminario de Nobles at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> but left at sixteen to join the army. From 1808 to 1813 he took an active part in the Spanish War of Independence. From 1813 to 1820 he lived quietly in <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, devoting his <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to literary pursuits, and from 1820 to 1823 he distinguished himself as a member of the Cortes. He sided with the revolutionary party, and as a result, when Ferdinand VII came into power, he was forced to flee, escaping with difficulty to <a href="../cathen/06550a.htm">Gibraltar</a>. From there he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and later to Malta where he remained five years during which he continued his literary activities, and then went to live in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Upon the death of Ferdinand VII, he was able to return to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1834). In 1836, he became minister of the interior in the cabinet headed by Isturiz, and in 1844 he was sent as ambassador to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> where he remained until 1850. Besides being a poet of great merit, Saavedra had considerable skill as a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, and during his exile in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, earned a living for himself and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> by conducting a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and by selling his pictures. But it is as a poet that he is best known. He published his first volume of "Poesias" in 1813 and in 1814, two tragedies, "Aliatur" and "El Duque de Aquitania". Only the first was presented. The works which place him in the front rank of Spanish poets are "El moro exp&oacute;sito", a narrative poem breathing a spirit of patriotism (1834), and the tragedy "Don Alvaro" (1835), presented with great success in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> and considered his best work. A complete edition of his works was published (5 vols., Madrid, 1854), under the title "Obras Completas", and in 1885 a complete edition with illustrations appeared ar Barcelona in two volumes.
