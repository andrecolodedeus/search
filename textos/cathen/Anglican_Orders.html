<h1>Anglican Orders</h1>  

<p>In the creed of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Order</a> is one of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Seven Sacraments</a> instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Its office is to transmit and perpetuate those mystic powers of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament of the altar</a> is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and offered up in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; and whereby alone the Sacraments of <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">Confirmation</a>, <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> can be validly administered.

<p>Holy Order is in three degrees: those of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> possessing the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in its plenitude, that is, with the power not only to exercise this ministry personally, but also to transmit it and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> to others. Thus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the only minister of Holy Order, and for its valid administration it is essential that he

<ul> <li>should himself have received a valid episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and <li>should use a <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> in which are reserved all the essentials of validity as instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. </ul>

<p>To have received or failed to receive orders under these <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> is to be within or without the <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolical succession</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ministry.

<p>In the sixteenth century this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> endowed with mystical powers was pronounced <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> by most of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Reformers</a>, who, accordingly, rejected Holy Order from among the number of their <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. They recognized, however, that from primitive times downwards there had always been a body of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> set apart for the pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and this they desired to retain in their separated communions; in some cases organizing it in two degrees only, of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, in others of three degrees, which, in accordance with ancient practice, they continued to designate by the names of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. But their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in regard to these <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> was that they could possess no powers beyond those of other men, but only "authority in the congregation" to preach and teach, to govern churches, and to preside over services and ceremonies; and that the rites, of <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> or otherwise, whereby candidates were inducted into the grades of their ministry, were to be regarded merely as simple and impressive external ceremonies employed for the sake of decency and order. This view of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ministry is very distinctly expressed in the public formularies and private writings of the continental <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it was certainly shared by Cranmer, Ridley, and others who with them presided over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> alterations in the reign of Edward VI. That the present <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> in the latter sense admits of no dispute. But are they so also in the former and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense; and are they in consequence in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> line of Apostolical succession, and endowed with all its mystical powers over the Sacrifice and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>? This is the question of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> orders.
<h2>The character of Catholic ordinals</h2>

<p>From time immemorial a group of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> rites have been in use in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and in those Oriental <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> which broke away from it in early times, but whose orders it has always recognized as valid. When these various rites are compared, they are found to differ indeed in the text, but to be entirely alike in the essential character of the "forms" appointed to accompany the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. All, that is to say, signify in appropriate terms the order to be imparted, and supplicate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to bestow upon the candidate the divine gifts <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for his state. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, though there are traces of a now obsolete "form" anciently employed in parts of Gaul, the form of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> is the only one that has persisted, and it quickly passed into universal use. This is the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <em>Deus honorum omnium</em>, which can be found in the "Pontificale Romanum." Its earliest appearance in writing is in the so-called "Leonine Sacramentary", referred by Duchesne to the sixth century; that it should appear there is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> positive that it must have been in existence for some time previously, at least as orally preserved, the force of which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is greatly strengthened by the testimony to the conservatism of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> which we have from <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a>. For this Pope, writing in A.D. 416, to Decentius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Eugubium, complains that "if the priests of the Lord desired to preserve ecclesiastical ordinances as they were handed down to us by the Blessed Apostles, no diversity, no variety would be found in the very orders and consecrations themselves", but adds, "Who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and consider that what was delivered to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> by St. Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, and <em>is to this day kept</em> (by it), ought to be observed by all, and that no practice should be substituted or added without being sanctioned by authority or precedent." When we trace downwards the history of this Roman rite we find that the conservative principle enunciated by <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">St. Innocent</a> has been faithfully followed. Thus Morinus, a great authority, writes, "We deem it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the reader to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the modern Roman Pontifical contains all that was in the earlier Pontificals, but that the earlier Pontificals do not contain all that is in the modern Roman Pontifical. For some things have been added to the recent Pontificals, for various <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and religious reasons, which are wanting in all the ancient editions. And that more recent Pontificals are, the more these additions obtrude themselves. But this is a wonderful and impressive fact, that in all the volumes, ancient, more modern, and contemporary, there is ever one form of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> both as regards words and as regards <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, and the later books omit nothing that was present in the older. Thus the modern form of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> differs neither in word nor in <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> from that used by the ancient Fathers." Among the additions which Morinus has in mind as having been made during the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, the tradition of the instruments, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> in the case of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and that of the book of the Gospels in the case of the episcopate, are the most important. Indeed, these drew to themselves so much attention that for many centuries they and the words accompanying them were supposed by many to be more essential even than the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <em>Deus honorum.</em> Still there was never any danger that the prevalence of these <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> views would affect the validity of the ordinations given, for the simple reason that the principle of never omitting anything was rigidly adhered to.


<h2>The origin of the Anglican succession</h2>

<p>It was this venerable <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> rite, as preserved in the English varieties of the Roman Pontifical, which was in use in the country when <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> began his assaults on the ancient religion. He did not himself venture to touch it, but in the next reign it was set aside by Cranmer and his associates who, under the rule of Somerset and Northumberland, were engaged in remodelling the whole fabric of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> to suit their extreme <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> conceptions. These men pronounced the ancient forms to be utterly <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and requiring to be replaced by others more in conformity with the simplicity of the Gospel. Hence the origin of the Edwardine Ordinal, which, under the sanction of the Act of 1550, was drawn up by "six <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and six other men of the realm learned in <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, by the King's Majesty to be appointed and assigned".

<p>This new rite underwent some further changes two years later, and was thus brought into the form in which it remained till the year 1662, when it was somewhat improved by the addition of clauses defining the nature of the orders imparted. As the Ordinal of 1550 had no lasting influence on the country, we may disregard it here, as we may also disregard, as of less consequence, the rite for the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>.

<p>In the Ordinal of 1552 the "essential form", that is, the form adjoined to the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, was, in the case of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, merely this: "Receive the Holy Ghost. Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> thou dost forgive they are forgiven; and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> thou dost retain they are retained; and be thou a faithful dispenser of the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of His Holy Sacraments"; and these other words, whilst the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was being delivered, "Take thou authority to preach the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to minister the Holy Sacraments in this Congregation, where thou shalt be so appointed." In the case of the episcopate it was, "Take the Holy Ghost, and remember that thou stir up the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> which is in thee by <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and of soberness"; and these others, while the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was delivered, "Give heed unto reading, exhortation, and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Think upon these things contained in this book . . . . Be to the flock of Christ a shepherd not a wolf; feed them, devour them not; hold up the weak, heal the sick, bind together the broken, bring again the outcast, seek the lost . . . ."

<p>The additions made in 1662 were, in the case of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (after the words, "receive the Holy Ghost"), "for the office and work of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> now committed unto thee by the imposition of our hands"; and in the case of the episcopate (after the words, "Take the Holy Ghost"), "for the office and work of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> now committed unto thee by the imposition of our hands".

<p>By this new Ordinal seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and a number of inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were made during the last two years of Edward VI. On the accession of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Mary</a> in 1553 it was discarded, and the Pontifical resumed, but on the accession of Elizabeth in 1558 its use was restored, and has continued (with the addition of the defining clauses since 1662) down to the present day. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are thus the creation of this Ordinal, and, primarily, the validity of their orders is dependent on its sufficiency &mdash; that is, on its sufficiency in its earlier form, for if that be wanting, the Apostolical succession must have lapsed long before 1662, and could not be resuscitated by the additions then made. It was on this consideration of the character of the Edwardine rite that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> based its definitive <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1896.

<p>Still, for the complete understanding of the history of the subject it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something of the circumstances under which Archbishop Parker was raised to the episcopate, and of the further defects which the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> succession has been thought to inherit from its relation to the same. This Dr. Matthew Parker was chosen by Queen Elizabeth to be her first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> was then vacant by the death of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, and all the other sees of the kingdom, with a single exception, were vacant likewise, either because of the death of their previous occupants, or because the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who survived were, in the eyes of the Government, deprived for refusing to conform to the new order of things. The Queen intended through Parker to raise up a new <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, but a difficulty confronted her. When <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> himself, Parker could <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> his intended colleagues; but how was he to get <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> himself? None of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> still living would consent to perform the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, and in default of them she had recourse to four <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of no very high reputation, three of whom (William Barlow, John Scory, and Miles Coverdale) had been deprived by <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Mary</a>, and the fourth (John Hodgkins) was a turncoat who had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bedford in 1537 and had consistently changed with every change of the times. To Barlow was given the lead, and he, with the others as his assistants, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Parker, 17 December, 1559, in the private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Lambeth, using the Edwardine Ordinal. Three days later Parker, with the aid of Barlow, Scory, and Hodgkins, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> four others at Bow <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">Church</a>. From these ancestors the whole <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> succession is sprung. Was, then, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Parker a valid act? This is the other ground of dispute round which, as a matter of history, the controversy has gathered.
<h2>The practice of the Holy See</h2>

<p>Apart from exceptional circumstances, such as arose in 1896, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> does not indulge in purely theoretical pronouncements on questions like that of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Orders, but limits its intervention to cases of practical difficulty that are brought before it &mdash; as when <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who wish to minister at the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> altars have undergone ceremonies of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> outside its fold. And even in thus intervening the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is chary of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions, but applies a common-sense rule that can give practical security. Where it judges that the previous orders were certainly valid it permits their use, supposing the candidate to be acceptable; where it judges the previous orders to be certainly invalid it disregards them altogether, and enjoins a re-ordination according to its own rite; where it judges that the validity of the previous orders is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, even though the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> be slight, it forbids their use until a conditional <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of re-ordination has first been undergone. Such a class of cases requiring its intervention arose when <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> set to work to draw order out of the chaos in which her two predecessors had involved the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. What was to be done with those who had received Edwardine orders? The question was investigated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither the needful information and documents were sent by <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a>, and, although we have no record of the discussion, it is clear from what has just been said about its known principles of action that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> judged these orders to be invalid, for it sent directions to <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a> to treat them as non-existent. That this was so appears

<ul><li>from the letters of <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> and <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, and the sense in which they were taken by <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a>, for these letters direct that all recipients of Edwardine Orders shall, if accepted for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ministry, be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> afresh; <li>from a comparison between the Edwardine and Marian registers which reveals several double entries of names of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who received first Edwardine and afterwards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>; <li>from the course taken in punishing recalcitrant Edwardine <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of whose degradation no account was taken of their Edwardine orders.</ul>

<p>And the practice thus initiated during the reign of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Mary</a> was adhered to ever afterwards, when <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> came over to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and sought admission into the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. A list of twenty such re-ordinations has been gathered by Canon Estcourt from the "Douay Diaries"; and others could be gathered from the registers of the English College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and other sources. Nor is the fact disputed &mdash; save perhaps as regards a few isolated cases, the documentary evidence for which is deficient. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/01644a.htm">"Apostolicae Curae"</a>, speaks of many such cases as having been formally referred to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> at different times, with the result that the practice of re-ordaining was invariably observed. Two of these cases were, in 1684 and 1704, the second of which attracted a certain amount of attention. It was that of John Clement Gordon, who had received all the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> orders, the episcopate included, by the Edwardine rite and from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who derived their orders from the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> succession. The decision was that, if he would minister as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he must receive the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and all previous orders afresh.
<h2>The history of the controversy</h2>

<p>Though such was the practice sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for dealing with <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> orders administratively, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> did not, as it usually does not, publish the motives of its decision. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of vindicating its action in regard to these orders was thus left to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and industry of private <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writers, whose method was to inquire into the facts as best they could and apply to them the same <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> tests as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> authorities were known to recognize. In this way there came into existence that series of controversial treatises on either side which covered the whole period from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the present day. Now that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has given not merely a final decision, but one supported by the motives on which it is based, these ancient treatises have lost a good deal of their interest. A very brief account of them may therefore suffice here, but the reader who requires more may be referred to the pages of Canon Estcourt. That the controversy did not begin till early in the reign of James I is, perhaps, explicable on the ground that the first generation or two of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were too <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglian</a> or <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> to care about having Apostolical succession.

<p>But in 1588-89 Bancroft, in a celebrated sermon at Paul's Cross, took up the higher ground, which was powerfully maintained a few years after by Bilson and Hooker, the pioneers of the long line of Jacobean and Caroline divines. Then the writers on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side began to controvert this position, but in the first instance not very happily. The circumstances of Parker's <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> had been shrouded in much secrecy and were unknown to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party, who accordingly gave credence to a piquant rumour called "The Nag's Head story". This was to the effect that, as no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could be got to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> Parker, he and others, when together at the Nag's Head in Cheapside, <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> down before Scory, the deprived <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a>, who placed a Bible on the neck of each, saying at the same time, "Receive the power of preaching the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sincerely"; and that this strange <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was the fountain-head of the whole <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> succession. This story was first published by Kellison in 1605, in his "Reply to Sutcliffe", and was taken up by some other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers in the following years. To these Mason in his "Vindiciae Ecclesiae Anglicanae" replied on the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> side, in 1613, and was the first to call attention, at all events effectively, to the entry in Parker's "Register" of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> on 17 December, 1559, in the private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Lambeth.

<p>In the following year (1614) Archbishop Abbot, to clench this statement of Mason's, caused four <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> in the Tower, to be taken to Lambeth and there shown the "Register", on the genuineness of which they were invited to declare. An inspection under such circumstances (for they were all the time under the jealous eyes of seven <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>) was not calculated to convince, and <a href="../cathen/03568a.htm">Champney</a>, who wrote in 1616, suggests, what was clearly the general opinion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at the time, that the entry in question was a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>.

<p>On one or two occasions previously it had apparently been seen by individual <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but its existence had not become generally known till Mason's book appeared, and then the fact that an appeal to it should not have been made by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> party till so long after the reputed date of the occurrence seemed to be highly suspicious. Nor will these suspicions appear unnatural to anyone who reflects on the curious reticence shown by the Elizabethan writers when challenged to say how their Metropolitan was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; such as, for instance, was shown by Jewell in his replies to Harding's direct inquiries. Probably, however, the real motive of this reticence was in the reputation of the consecrators to whom Parker was driven to have recourse; for there can be no question, to us who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the lines of converging evidence that tell in its favour, but that his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> did take place on the day and in the manner described in the "Register", and that the latter was a contemporary document. On the other hand, the Nag's Head story is too unsupported by solid evidence and too incredible in itself to be accepted as historical &mdash; although to say this is by no means the same as saying that those who brought it forward in the first instance, or maintained it during several generations, were acting dishonestly. It is, however, an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to suppose that the early <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> controversialists rested their case against <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> orders exclusively on the spuriousness of the Lambeth "Register" or the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Nag's Head story. On the contrary, although they intermingled some <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> like those mentioned which have had to be abandoned, it is wonderful how sound was the position they took up from the first in their general statement of the argument. Thus <a href="../cathen/03568a.htm">Champney</a>, the first systematic writer on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, directs his first and chief attack against all orders conveyed by the Edwardine Ordinal, whether in the reign of Edward VI or subsequently, and contests their validity on the ground of the insufficiency of the rite itself. Moreover, though inclining, with most of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of his time, to hold that other ceremonies besides <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and the words, "Receive the Holy Ghost", were essential to validity, he gives due weight to the contrary opinion of Vasquez, and takes up exactly the same position as was afterwards taken up by Morinus in regard to the practical course to be followed. "The determinate matter", he says, "and form of some <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> &mdash; and, among others, of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>, . . .are not so clearly and distinctly declared in the Councils and Fathers, but that various opinions, based on weighty reasons and authorities, have been held and defended with good probability of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> . . . (But) the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not suffer any harm or loss (from this uncertainty) because she knows for certain that she has (in her rites) the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form which Christ gave to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, although no one can define precisely in what things and words it is contained . . . provided that there is no omission of any part (of the rite) which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is wont to use in administering her <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and in which it is universally agreed that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form is contained. But if anyone were obstinately to follow his own opinion, and exclude all other things, actions, and words in administering the said <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, save such as he himself judges essential, he would render those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> untrustworthy, and would in consequence be inflicting on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a most serious harm." It is only when he comes to treat of Elizabethan orders in their relation to Archbishop Parker that <a href="../cathen/03568a.htm">Champney</a> alleges other grounds of invalidity, and he then comprises his entire case against them under the following five heads &mdash; (1) the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Nag's Head story; (2) the spuriousness of the Lambeth "Register"; (3) the want of episcopal character in Barlow, Parker's chief consecrator; (4) the insecurity of the rite used, in view of its many omissions; (5) the probability that it does not contain the essentials of a valid Ordinal. These are the same arguments which the subsequent writers debated and developed, except for a somewhat different handling of the fifth, the necessity for which became apparent not long after <a href="../cathen/03568a.htm">Champney's</a> time. For <a href="../cathen/03568a.htm">Champney</a>, as we have seen, though without speaking too positively, contended for the necessity of other elements in the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form than the mere <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and the words attached to this. In 1655, however, Morinus's epoch-making work, "De Sacris Ordinationibus", appeared, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by irresistible documentary evidence that not only, as was previously recognized, had <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> been all through the sole matter of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, episcopal and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a>, in the Oriental rites, but that even in the Western rite it had been so for about 900 years, the ceremonies of tradition of instruments and of unction not being found in any text of more ancient date, still less that of the second <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The discovery of this <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> fact necessarily influenced the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> controversy, and though the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in its rigid adherence to the practical rule indicated by <a href="../cathen/03568a.htm">Champney</a>, still insists on the retention of the other ceremonies in all Western ordinations, the general tendency since the publication of Morinus's work has been to reject the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> rite mainly on the ground of the insufficiency of the "form" attached to the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. On these lines the controversy was continued in the latter part of the seventeenth century by Talbot and Lewgar on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, and by Bramhall, Burner, and Prideaux on the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>.

<p>At the commencement of the next century, in 1704, the case of John Clement Gordon, to which reference has already been made, was taken before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and examined. The result was to elicit from the Holy Office a formal re-affirmation of the necessity of re-ordaining convert <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>; nor was this decision motived, as an incorrect publication of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> by <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> suggested, by any acceptance of the Nag's Head story, but, as is now known, by the nature of the Edwardine rite, a copy of which was procured and specially examined by the Sacred Congregation. A few years later the scene of the controversy shifted to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Abb&eacute; Renaudot wrote a "M&eacute;moire", published in 1720, in which he rejected <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> orders on the grounds of the Nag's Head story, and of the novelty and insufficiency of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> rite. He was answered shortly after by the Pere Courayer, whose works in defence of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> orders, as coming from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, caused a great sensation in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where the author was held in high favour; and later, when he had to leave <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> on a charge of unsound <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, he was invited over to this country and was given a pension by George II. The principal answer to Courayer was that of the <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Abb&eacute; Le Quien</a>, whose "Nullit&eacute; des ordinations anglicanes" appeared (Paris) in 1730, but Father John Constable, S.J., embodied a great part of it in his "Clerophilus Alethes", an English work published very shortly after. In the nineteenth century, with the rise of the Tractarian party, and of the more <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> which it caused to prevail, the question of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> orders was felt to be of vital importance for the High Church <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the controversy became proportionately more acute. As, too, the principles of historical evidence had by then come to be better understood, and the facilities for the study of documents were vastly improved, a series of works resulted which has considerably advanced our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the subject. Of these the most valuable on rise <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> side were Mr. A. W. Haddan's edition of Bramhall, and his own "Apostolical Succession in the Church of England", Dr. F. G. Lee's "Validity of the Holy Orders of the Church of England", and more recently Mr. Denny's "Anglican Orders and Jurisdiction", the last being perhaps the most complete work that has appeared in defence of these orders. On the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, Canon Estcourt's "Question of Anglican Orders Discussed" and Mr. W. A. Hutton's "Anglican Ministry" were the most noticeable. The former, though it errs in giving away an important argument, through misconceiving the purport of a decision of the Holy Office, still bears the palm among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> treatises for its scholarly investigation of many historical points; the latter is chiefly valuable for its exposition of the broader aspect under which <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> preferred to regard the subject.
<h2>Summary of arguments on either side</h2>

<p>To some extent the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> and disproofs cast to and fro by the disputants have necessarily been indicated above, but it will be well to summarize them here as a preliminary to an account of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/01644a.htm">"Apostolicae Curae"</a>.

<p>1. Of the Nag's Head story nothing more need be said, as no person of intelligence now believes in it.

<p>2. Nor is there any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that Parker really did undergo a <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> on 17 December, 1559, at Lambeth, in which the Edwardine rite was employed, and the consecrators were Barlow, Scory, Coverdale, and Hodgkins. Machyn's and Parker's diaries prove conclusively that a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> did then and there take place. A paper in the State Paper Office (in which the order of procedure to be followed at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is drawn up by a clerk, and Cecil's and Parker's annotations are in the margin) proves that they intended to have a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> according to the Edwardine rite, whilst there was nothing to prevent them from carrying their intention into effect. And the Commission of 6 December, 1559, issued to Kitchen, Barlow, Scory, Coverdale, and Hodgkins, shows that these, or some of them, were the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who were to perform the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>.

<p>3. In regard to Barlow's episcopal character, the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> case is that

<ul> <li>although there is no record of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in the "Archiepiscopal Register", this only proves that the "Register" was very negligently kept; that <li>there is no record in this "Register" of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrations</a> of several other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Gardiner included, yet no one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> that these were really <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; and that <li>it is not conceivable that Barlow could have gone on acting as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for over twenty years without attention having been called by some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or other to his want of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.</ul>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, on the other hand, point out that it is not merely the absence of just a single entry in Cranmer's "Register" which stands against him, but

<ul> <li>the absence of an entire set of documents which should have borne reference to his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> if it occurred; <li>the discovery of one document which is exceptionally worded, and so worded as apparently to provide for the avoidance of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; <li>the views of the non-necessity of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> which Barlow held and expressed; <li>the difficulty of assigning a date when the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> could have taken place; <li>and the likelihood that, as the King and Cranmer are known to have shared his views, he might have been able to keep his secret to himself and pass as a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. </ul>

<p>Still the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers do not maintain on these grounds that it is certain he was not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, but only that it is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he was, and hence, that orders derived from him, as are those of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, must be considered <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, unless supplemented by a conditional <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>.

<p>4. For the sufficiency of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Rite, as it stood in the first century of its use, the defenders argue that, although it may have been undesirable to substitute this new rite for the ancient and venerable rite which preceded it, the change was within the competence of the Edwardine and Elizabethan authorities, since every national Church has authority to select its own rites and ceremonies, as long as it eliminates no element which, in the judgment of the Universal Church, is essential to validity. To this it is replied that no evidence is forthcoming to show that any such authority has ever been recognized in national Churches; that, on the contrary, though local churches have at times added further <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and ceremonies to the rites handed down to them from time immemorial, they have, as Morinus has told us, never ventured to subtract anything that was in previous use, fearing lest in so doing they might touch something which was essential. To this the defenders reply that at least the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> rite has retained all that is to be found in the Roman Ordinal in its earliest known form, as well as in the Eastern ordinals, which the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has ever recognized as valid; and that it must be held therefore to have retained all that can reasonably be claimed as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. But in the first place, though the course of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinion inclines to judge that the tradition of instruments and other added ceremonies in the modern Western rite might be laid aside without danger to validity, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, as has been said, feeling that in a matter of such supreme importance it is best to follow an absolutely safe rule, is loth to trust to speculative opinions, and has always required a conditional re-ordination whenever any one of the added ceremonies has been omitted. Moreover, it is not correct to say that the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> rite retains all those elements which the Eastern and early Western rites have in common. For what these have in common (cf. App. IV of the Vindication) is <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> accompanied by a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in which the order to be imparted is defined either by its accepted name, or by words expressive of its grace and power, which is chiefly the power to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> and offer up in sacrifice the Body and Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> under the appearances of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>. The original <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> rite, on the contrary, contained no words whatever in the "form" accompanying the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> to define the order to be imparted. In the rite for the episcopate the consecrating <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> says, "Take the Holy Ghost"; but he does not, say for what &mdash; whether for the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> &mdash; so much so that <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Dr. Lingard</a> could suggest that it was a form as suitable for the admission of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> clerk as for the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. And so, too, with the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, though in a somewhat less degree. For here the words of the "form" are, "Receive the Holy Ghost; whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> thou dost forgive they are forgiven, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> thou dost retain, they are retained. And be thou a faithful dispenser of the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of His Holy Sacraments"; whereas the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> does not discriminate between the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and besides is only a secondary and incidental, not the primary and essential, function of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office. Still the defenders of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Ordinal have their further rejoinder. It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, they contend, that the nature of the order imparted should be defined by the words of the "form" taken by itself alone; it is sufficient if the meaning of this "form" is determined to a definite sense by the context, or other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and ceremonies which precede or follow; and they point out that in the titles of the rites &mdash; "The form of ordering Priests" and "The form of consecrating an Archbishop or Bishop" &mdash; in the presentation of the candidates, and in several of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the needful mention of the order to be imparted is declared. Moreover, they refer to a decision of the Holy Office, 9 April, 1704, in regard to some <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> ordinations, as witnessing that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> itself has recognized the words, "Take the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>", to be sufficient, when said with the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, if the remainder of the rite is sufficiently determinate. But, in the first place, as regards this <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> case, its nature has been misapprehended, as may be seen from the documents published by Father Brandi, in his "Roma e Canterbury". In the second place, none of the rites, ancient or modern, which the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has ever recognized lends any support to this theory of an indeterminate form determined by a remote context. In the third place, it is contrary to the analogy of all the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and is unreasonable in itself. It is as if, writes Cardinal Segna (Revue Anglo-Romaine, 29 February, 1896), in a wedding <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, "the bride and bridegroom should stand at the altar and in many an eloquent phrase declare their mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but when the moment has arrived for pronouncing the decisive word "I will";, should "shut their lips in stubborn silence." And in the fourth place, the remote context, instead of determining the words, "Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>", to signify the bestowal of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, determines them to an exactly opposite sense. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the traditional names of the three orders occur in places, but, as explained at the head of this article, these names at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> were often used in a sense from which all notion of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and its mystical powers had been drained off. That this was the sense in which they were intended by those who framed and authorized the Edwardine rites is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the statements of classical <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> writers like Hooker, who defend the retention of the old names on the plea that "as for the people, when they hear the name [<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>] it draweth no more their minds to any cogitation of sacrifice than the name of a senator or of an alderman causeth them to think upon old age, or to imagine that every one so termed must needs be ancient because years were respected in the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of both" (Eccles. Polity, V, lxxviii, 2). There is, moreover, the broad fact that, when the old and the new rite are compared, it appears that the difference lies just in this: that the framers of the new have cut out all that in the old gave expression to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a mystic <em>sacerdotium</em> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense of the term. There is also the connected fact that the introduction of the Edwardine Ordinal was the outcome of the same general movement which led to the pulling down of the altars and the substitution of communion tables, in order that, as Ridley expressed it, "the form of a table shall more move the simple people from the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> opinions of the Popish mass unto the right use of the Lord's supper".

<p>5. According to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for validity that the minister of a sacrament should not only employ a proper form, but should also have a proper <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm"><em>intention</em></a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a>, in his instructions to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a> (which <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> cites in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of condemnation), tells him to treat as not validly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> those pretending <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in whose previous <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> ceremonies "the form and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm"><em>intention</em></a> of the Church had not been observed", thereby implying that this double defect was present in the Edwardine <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrations</a>. On this point the defenders of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> orders urge that (1) to admit that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> intentions of the minister can affect the validity of the Sacrament is to involve in uncertainty all ordinations whatever &mdash; for how are we to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what internal lapses or deflections from the due intention may not have been secretly made by those on whose acts the orders of whole generations of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> have been dependent? &mdash; and (2) even granting this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of intention, no defect of due intention should be imputed to the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of any generation, since, according to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a> like <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, even an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> minister's intention is sufficient as long as it is a general intention to do what Christ does or His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church does, whatever this may be. But, it is replied, it is impossible not to recognize that the minister's intention is an essential element. Why, for instance, is there a valid <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> at Mass when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> pronounces the words, "This is my Body", but no valid <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> when he pronounces the same words in the presence of bread whilst reading from St. Matthew's Gospel in a community refectory? Still the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> trusts to the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence of God</a> to watch over all such defective intentions as are not externally manifested, and assumes that the minister's intention is correct in every serious administration of her own rites, even when he is &mdash; like Cranmer, for instance &mdash; a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of heterodox opinions. Where, however, a defective intention is manifested externally, she must deal with it, and that is what has happened in respect to the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> ordinations. The rite, as has been explained, was altered in Edward VI's time to give expression to a heterodox <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> concerning the nature of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>, and was likewise adopted in this sense by the Elizabethan authorities. When, then, they proceeded to administer it, the only reasonable interpretation of their action was that they conformed their intention to their rite, and hence that, from a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> point of view, their acts were invalid on a twofold ground: the defect of the form and the defect of the intention.

<p>6. In modern times the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> often appeal, as confirmatory of the above <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and historical considerations, or even as having an independent value, to what may be called an experiential argument. "It is all very well", they say, "to bring forward these external arguments to discredit our orders. But we have an internal testimony which appeals to us more powerfully, namely our intimate consciousness of the spiritual benefit we experience when we make use of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of which our orders are the source to us. If they were invalid orders, how is it conceivable that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should so <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> their use to those who have recourse to them?" This is an argument which no one has stated more forcibly than <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> in the Third Lecture of his "Anglican Difficulties", where, too, the most searching answer to it may be found. Here it will be enough to say

<ul> <li>that for those who bring it forward it proves too much, since Wesleyans and others could claim as much, and on the same grounds, for their own ordinances, which no one supposes to be dependent for their efficacy on the validity of an Apostolical succession; <li>that it confounds the efficacy of a rite ex opere operato, or as an appointed channel of sacramental grace, and its efficacy ex opere operantis, or as a stimulus to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of well-disposed hearts; <li>that the rule of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is, while by no means undervaluing the evidential power of internal experience, to interpret this and detect its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bearing by applying the test of her own divinely authenticated external teaching. </ul>
<h2>The bull of Leo XIII</h2>

<p>From the foregoing account it can readily be understood why the practice of re-ordaining <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> has subsisted. <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, however, have always resented this practice, and maintained that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> could never have sanctioned it had the facts been properly presented.

<p>In 1894 this contention was pressed upon the notice of some <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> by some <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> leaders who were discussing with them the prospects of corporate reunion. The result was that the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> brought the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> to the notice of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, assuring him that this impression prevailed among many well-disposed <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, who felt that they were being unfairly treated. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> was moved by what he heard, and determined that he would have the whole question re-investigated thoroughly. Accordingly, he selected eight divines who had made a special study of the subject, and of whom four were known to be disposed to recognize <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> orders and four to be disposed to reject them. These he summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and formed into a consultative commission under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/10094c.htm">Cardinal Mazzella</a>. They were given access to all documents from the archives of the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a> and the Holy Office which would throw light upon the points at issue, and they were bidden to sift the evidence on either side with all possible fulness and care. After sessions which lasted six weeks, the Commission was dissolved, and the acta of its discussions were laid before a judicial committee of cardinals. These, after a two months' study, in a special meeting under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, decided by a unanimous vote that <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> orders were certainly invalid.

<p>After an interval for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayerful</a> consideration of this vote, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> determined to adopt it and accordingly published his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/01644a.htm">"Apostolicae Curae"</a> on the 18th of September, 1896. In this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> he begins by expressing his affectionate interest in the English people and his desire for their return to unity, and by reciting the circumstances which had led to the issue of this solemn decision. He then calls attention to the action taken in the same matter by his predecessors.

<p>In the reign of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Mary</a>, when she and <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a> were engaged in reconciling the kingdom, letters of direction were sent to the latter, which, as their text shows, required him to treat those who had received orders by a form other than "the accustomed form of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" &mdash; a phrase which, says Pope Leo, can only refer to the Edwardine Ordinal &mdash; as needing to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> afresh. At that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, then, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> judged the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> form to be insufficient, and that it persisted in this adverse judgment is manifest from the fact that for more than three centuries it has sanctioned the practice of re-ordaining absolutely the holders of orders obtained through this form; for "since in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> it has always been a firm and established rule that the sacrament of Order ought not to be repeated, it never could have silently acquiesced in and tolerated such a <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a>", had it deemed the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> form to be in any way sufficient.

<p>Moreover, continues the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> not only acquiesced in the practice, but on many occasions gave it renewed <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanction</a> by express judgments, to two of which, the second being that of John Clement Gordon, it calls particular attention, repudiating in connection with this latter the allegation that the rejection of Gordon's previous orders had been motivated by any other cause than the character of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> (a copy of which was procured and examined by the judges), or even that in judging of the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> the essential point considered was the <a href="../cathen/11251b.htm">omission</a> in it of any tradition of the instruments.

<p>This account of the practice of his predecessors forms the first part of the <a href="../cathen/01644a.htm">"Apostolicae Curae"</a>, and in view of it <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> observes that the question could not really be considered still open. He has wished, however, "to help men of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> will by showing them the greatest consideration and charity," and he proceeds to expound the principles on which the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">Rite</a> is judged by himself, as well as by his predecessors, to lack the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of validity.

<p>"In the examination", he says, "of any <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> for the effecting and administering of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a>, distinction is rightly made between the part which is <em>ceremonial</em> and that which is <em>essential,</em> usually called the "matter" and "form". All <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments of the New Law</a>, as sensible and efficient signs of invisible grace, ought both to signify the grace which they effect, and effect the grace which they signify. Although the signification ought to be found in the whole essential <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a>, that is to say, in the "matter" and "form", it still pertains chiefly to the "form"; since the "matter" is the part which is not determined by itself, but which is determined by the "form". And this appears still more clearly in the Sacrament of Orders, the <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> of which, in so far as we have to consider it in this case, is the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, which indeed by itself signifies nothing definite, and is equally used for several orders and for <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a>. But the words which until recently were commonly held by <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> to constitute the proper form of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> &mdash; namely: "Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" &mdash; certainly do not in the least definitely express the sacred Order of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">Priesthood</a>, or its grace and power, which is chiefly the power "of consecrating and of <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> the true Body and Blood of the Lord" (Council of Trent, Sess. XXIII, de Sacr. Ord., Can. 1) in that <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice</a> which is "no nude commemoration of the sacrifice of the Cross" (<em>ibid.</em>, Sess. XXIII, de Sacr. Miss., Can. 3) . . . . The same holds good of episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. For to the formula, "Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>", not only were the words "for the office and work of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>" etc., added at a later period, but even these, as we shall presently state, must be understood in a sense different from that which they bear in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a>."

<p>In this passage the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanctions</a> the principle that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> must signify definitely what it is to effect, and that this definite signification must be in the essential "form", or words in proximate connection with the "matter"; also that, in the case of Holy Order, what must be definitely signified is, in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Order of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">Priesthood</a> or its grace and power, and similarly in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; the grace and power in each having reference to the accomplishment of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>.

<p>This principle accepted, it follows at once that the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Ordinal, at least as it stood till 1662, lacks the essential <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of sufficiency. But the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> further examines how far the remainder of this Ordinal, or the circumstances under which it came into being, can be held to determine the ambiguity of the "essential form". And here it <a href="../cathen/13428a.htm">sanctions</a> the judgment which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers had already formed. "The history," it says, "of that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> is sufficiently eloquent as to the <em>animus</em> of the authors of the Ordinal against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; as to the abettors whom they associated with themselves from heterodox <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>; and as to the end in view . . . . Under a pretext of returning to the primitive form, they corrupted the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> order in many ways to suit the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. For this reason, in the whole Ordinal not only is there no clear mention of the sacrifice, but every trace of these things which had been in such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> as they had not entirely rejected, was deliberately removed and struck out. In this way the native <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> &mdash; or spirit, as it is called &mdash; of the Ordinal clearly manifests itself. Hence, if, vitiated in its origin, it was wholly insufficient to confer orders, it was impossible that in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> it should become sufficient, since it remained always what it was (i.e. of vitiated origin) . . . . For once a new <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> has been initiated, in which, as we have seen, the Sacrament of Orders is adulterated or denied, and from which all <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and sacrifice has been rejected, the formula, "Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>" (the Spirit, namely, which is infused into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the grace of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a>) no longer holds good, and so the words "for the office and work of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>", and the like, no longer hold good, but remain as words without the reality which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted."

<p>Likewise in regard to the defect of <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> endorses the judgment adverse to <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers had always urged. "When anyone has rightly and seriously made use of the due "form" and "matter" requisite for effecting or conferring the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, he is considered by that very fact to do what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does. On this principle rests the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is truly conferred by the ministry of one who is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> or unbaptized, provided the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> be employed. On the other hand, if the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> be changed, with the manifest <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of introducing another <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> not approved by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of rejecting what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does, and what, by the institution of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, then it is clear that not only is the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> wanting to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> is adverse to, and destructive of, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a>."

<p>These are the defects in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Succession, on the existence of which the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> bases its decision. It will be noticed that they are of the most fundamental kind, and are independent of any defects that may be thought to arise out of the omission in the Ordinal of a tradition of the instruments, or of the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about Barlow's <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. To examine into the nature and bearing of the latter when a sufficient basis for a certain conclusion had been supplied by the former would have been a superfluous task, and for the same reason it is unlikely that even for the private inquirer these other considerations will retain in the future the interest they had in the past. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> has in no way pronounced them to be frivolous or unfounded, as has been suggested. It remains to give the formal definition of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, which is in the following terms: "Wherefore, strictly adhering in this matter to the decrees of the Pontiffs Our Predecessors, and confirming them most fully, and, as it were, renewing them by Our authority, of Our own motion and certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> We pronounce and declare that ordinations carried out according to the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> rite have been and are absolutely null and void."

<p>The publication of the <a href="../cathen/01644a.htm">"Apostolicae Curae"</a> caused, as was to be expected, much excitement in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; nor did the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> party, for whose sake it was intended, show any disposition to accept either its arguments or its decision. It was deemed, however, to have created a crisis sufficiently serious to require that it should be met by some formal reply. Accordingly, in the early part of 1897 there appeared, in both a Latin and an English edition, an "Answer of the Archbishops of England to the Apostolic Letter of Pope Leo XIII on English Ordinations", which was "addressed to the whole body of Bishops of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". This answer, which came to be known by its Latin name of the "Responsio", is a distinctly Low-Church document, of which the leading contention is that the Pope has misjudged the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Ordinal through failure to recognize the right of national Churches to reform and revise their own formulas, and by applying to this Ordinal a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and untrustworthy rule. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> rule to which an ordinal should be conformed, it urges, is the rule of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, and it is in this rule that the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> sought their guidance. They found an enormous accretion of sacerdotalist <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> embodied in the words and ceremonies of the older Ordinal, whereas, in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, the sacerdotalist conception of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ministry was altogether absent. And, on the other hand, they found that the aspects of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ministry on which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> had laid the most stress &mdash; those, namely, which concerned the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor's</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to go forth in His Master's name as His steward, His watchman, His messenger, to tend the sheep, and, if need be, lay down his life for their sakes, to preach the word, to convert sinners, to remit offences in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to render mutual services to one another, and much else of the same kind &mdash; were very insufficiently set forth in the Pontifical. Accordingly, in drawing up their new rite, they endeavoured as far as possible to eliminate the former element and give prominence to the latter, while in their "forms" they assigned to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> the words which, according to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> used in promoting His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to this office, and to the episcopate the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> which "were believed to refer to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of St. Timothy to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ephesus". Nor, in following precedents so lofty, could they reasonably be charged with having endangered the efficacy of their rite. This is in brief the defensive argument of the "Responsio". But it also charges the Pope with having, in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to condemn the orders of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>, overlooked the contradictions in which he was involving the position of his own Church. In condemning the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> "forms" as wanting in definite signification, he condemned, by implication, the orders of his own Church, since the Roman Pontifical in its pre-medieval text was not a whit more definite than the Elizabethan <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>; and in attaching the sacramental virtue to the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and the connected words he was condemning by implication his predecessor, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>, who attached that virtue to the tradition of instruments and the words connected therewith, not even making mention of <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> among the requisites. One thing was made clear by the "Responsio", and by the other criticisms of the <a href="../cathen/01644a.htm">"Apostolicae Curae"</a> which poured forth from the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> press, namely, that the character of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> and its arguments had been greatly misapprehended. Hence, <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> and the English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Bishops, in the early part of 1898, published a "Vindication of the Bull 'Apostolicae Curae'", in reply to a letter addressed to them by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and York." In this "Vindication", after some preliminary observations on the extrinsic reasons which the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> had given for its decision, attention is called to the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> standpoint from which the two <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> had judged the arguments of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. In their "Responsio" they are mainly occupied with challenging the soundness of the principles on which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decision had been based. They urge that it rests on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and unscriptural conception of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and that, if for this the more scriptural conception expounded by themselves had been substituted, the decision must have been different. But this, the "Vindication" points out, is <em>ignoratio elenchi.</em> Of course the Pope considers that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> conception of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is in conformity with Scripture; but that was not the question under consideration. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> grievance was that those of their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who came over to us were re-ordained; and to complain of this was to contend that even on our principles their orders ought to be recognized; while no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the particular section of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican communion</a> which took most to heart this practice of re-ordination was in substantial agreement with us as to our conception of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Hence the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in examining the question, necessarily assumed the validity of its own principles, and inquired only if they had been duly applied. The "Vindication", however, to facilitate the understanding of the Pope's reasons, sets itself to expand, explain, and vindicate by reference to the facts those points which the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, after the manner of legal documents, gives only in a highly condensed form. It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> here to epitomize the "Vindication", but mention may be made of its study of the opinions in regard to the Eucharistic Presence, the Mass, and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of Cranmer and his associates, as likewise of the opinions on the same subjects expressed by a series of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> divines during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which showed that the tradition initiated by Cranmer persisted.
<h2>The authority of "Apostolicae Curae"</h2>

<p>The question has been raised whether the pronouncement of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/01644a.htm">"Apostolicae Curae"</a> is or is not to be taken as an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> utterance of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. But even if it were not it would not follow that it can be disregarded, and its eventual withdrawal confidently anticipated. What may be safely assumed is that it fixes the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and practice of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> irrevocably. This at least <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> must have meant to signify when in his letter to Cardinal Richard, of 5 November, 1896, he declared that his "intention had been to pass a final judgment and settle (the question) forever" (<em>absolute judicare et penitus dirimere</em>), and that "Catholics were bound to receive (the judgment) with the fullest obedience as <em>perpetuo firmam, ratam, irrevocabilem</em>".

<p>Still, as a matter of speculative interest, it may be asked whether the definition is strictly <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, and the answer may be stated shortly thus. It belongs to a class of <em>ex <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a></em> utterances for which <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> is claimed on the ground, not indeed, of the terms of the Vatican definition, but of the constant practice of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the consentient teaching of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, as well as of the clearest deductions from the principles of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>To understand what is meant it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to bear in mind the distinction between a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and a <a href="../cathen/05092a.htm">dogmatic fact</a>, the former being a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of revelation, the latter a fact so intimately connected with a revealed <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that it would be impossible without inconsistency to assert the former and deny the latter. It may be urged that the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> merely <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that the Pope when speaking <em>ex cathedra</em> has "that infallibility which the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">divine Redeemer</a> wished His Church to have in defining doctrine of faith and morals", without going on to define the range of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> wished His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to have. But it must be remembered

<ul> <li>that the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, had it not been forced to suspend its sittings by the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, intended to supplement this first definition by others which would have gone into details in regard to the object of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>; <li>that to suppose that Church authority can define a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but cannot decide whether it is contained in or denied by any particular writing &mdash; such as an <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> rite &mdash; is to suppose that the power of defining <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is largely nugatory; and <li>that since the time of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> there has been a practical <em>consensus theologorum</em> in holding that <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> does extend to <a href="../cathen/05092a.htm">dogmatic facts</a>, a judgment which would undoubtedly bring this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> within the category of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> utterances.</ul>
