<h1>Anglicanism</h1>  

<p>A term used to denote the religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and position of members of the <a href="../cathen/05548a.htm">established</a> Church of England, and of the communicating churches in the British possessions, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (see <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">E<font size=-2>PISCOPAL</font> C<font size=-2>HURCH</font></a>), and elsewhere. It includes those who have accepted the work of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> as embodied in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> or in the offshoot Churches which in other countries have adhered, at least substantially, to its doctrines, its organization, and its liturgy. Apart from minor or missionary settlements, the area in which Anglicanism is to be found corresponds roughly with those portions of the globe which are, or were formally, under the British flag.
<h2>Beliefs</h2>

<p>To form a general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of Anglicanism as a religious system, it will be convenient to sketch it in rough outline as it exists in the Established Church of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, bearing in mind that there are differences in detail, mainly in liturgy and church-government, to be found in other portions of the Anglican communion.

<ul> <li>The members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> are professed <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and claim to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of Christ.</a> <li>They accept the Scriptures as contained in the <a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">Authorized Version</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Word of God</a>. <li>They hold the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> to be the sole and supreme <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, in the sense that the Scriptures contain all things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and that nothing can be required of anyone as an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> which is not contained therein, and cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> thereby. <li>They accept the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a> as the practical rule of their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and worship, and in it they use as standards of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> the three Creeds &mdash; the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles'</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Athanasian</a>. <li>They <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the Gospel &mdash; <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Lord's Supper</a> &mdash;as generally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <li>They claim to have <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolic succession</a> and a validly <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> ministry, and only <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom they believe to be thus <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> are allowed to minister in their churches. <li>They believe that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and reformed part, or branch, or pair of provinces of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <li>They maintain that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is free from all foreign <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. <li>They recognize the King as Supreme Governor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and acknowledge that to him "appertains the government of all estates whether civil or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, in all causes." <li>The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, before being appointed to a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> or licensed to preach, subscribe and declare that they "assent to the Thirty-nine Articles, and to the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a>, and of Ordering of Bishops, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and believe the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as therein set forth to be agreeable to the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". <li>One of the Articles (XXV) thus subscribed approves the First and Second Book of Homilies as containing "a godly and wholesome doctrine necessary for these times", and adjudges them to be read in churches "diligently and distinctly". </ul>

<p>To these general characteristics we may add by way of corrective that while the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> is accepted much latitude is allowed as to the nature and extent of its inspiration; that the Eucharistic teaching of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer Book</a> is subject to various and opposed interpretations; that <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolic succession</a> is claimed by many to be beneficial, but not essential, to the nature of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; that the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> is the only one to which assent can be required from the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and that Articles of Religion are held to be binding only on the licensed and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.
<h2>Chief government</h2>

<p>Inside these outlines, which are necessarily vague, the constitution of the Church of England has been largely determined by the events which attended its settlement under the Tudors.
<h3>Original loyalty to Rome</h3>

<p>Before the breach with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> there was absolutely no <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> difference between the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Englishmen and the rest of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, and "Anglicanism", as connoting a separate or independent religious system, was unknown.

<p>The name <em>Ecclesia Anglicana</em>, or English Church, was of course employed, but always in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Papal use of the term as signifying that part or region of the one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Pope which was situated in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and precisely in the same way as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> was called the <em>Ecclesia Scotticana</em>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <em>Ecclesia Gallicana</em>, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the <em>Ecclesia Hispanica.</em> That such national or regional appellations were a part of the style in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> itself, and that they in no sense could have implied any indication of independence from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, is sufficiently well known to all who are familiar with pre-Reformation records. <ul> <li>Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, in 1218, in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> to King Alexander speaks of the Scottish Church (<em>Ecclesia Scotticana</em>) as "being <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>" (Papal Letters I, 60). <li>The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in their letter to <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, in 1246, declared that the English Church (<em>Ecclesia Anglicana</em>) is "a special member of the Most Holy Church of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>" [<a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a> (Rolls Series), IV, 531]. <li>In 1413 Archbishop Arundel, with the assent of Convocation, affirmed against the <a href="../cathen/09333a.htm">Lollards</a> the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the English Church in a number of test articles, including the Divine institution of the Papacy and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to render obedience to it (Wilkins, Concilia, III, 355). <li>In 1521, only thirteen years before the breach, John Clerk, the English Ambassador at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was able to assure the Pope in full consistory that <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was second to no country in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, "not even to Rome itself", in the "service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: and of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, and in the obedience due to the Most <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>" (Clerks' oration, ed. <a href="../cathen/05410a.htm">Jerome Emser</a>). </ul>


<h3>After the Act of Royal Supremacy (1534)</h3>

<p>The first point of severance was clearly one of <a href="../cathen/05514a.htm">Erastianism.</a> When news of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decision against the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> reached <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> gave his assent to four anti-papal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> passed in Parliament in the spring of 1534, and in November the statute of the Royal Supremacy declared the King to be Supreme Head of the English Church (without the limiting clause of 1532), and an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was prescribed, affirming the Pope to have no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the realm of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The actual ministry of preaching and of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> was left to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but all the powers of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> were claimed by the sovereign.

<ul> <li>The Act of Supremacy required that the King, as Supreme Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, "shall have full power and authority from time to time to visit, repress, redress, reform, order, correct, restrain, and amend all such <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, abuses, offences, contempt, enormities whatsoever they be which by any manner, spiritual authority or <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> ought or may be lawfully reformed" (26 Henry VIII, i). <li>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were made to sue out their faculties from the King, and, that the meaning of this humiliation should be unmistakable, the very form of the license granted them affirmed the plain Erastian principle that the Crown was the source of their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, "seeing that all authority of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and indeed <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of all kinds, both that which is called <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and that which is secular, is originally derived from the royal power, as from the Supreme Head and foundation, and source of magistracy within our Kingdom" (Wilkins, Concilia, III, 799), <li>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in convocation were forbidden to make canons except when the King, by his "Letters of Business", gave them permission to do so, and even then the canons so made were to have effect only when approved by the King. <li>Another statute secured to the Crown the absolute control in the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The chapters were bound under penalties of <em>Proemunire</em> to elect the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> named by the King and no other, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> was bound under the same shameful penalties to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> so named within twenty days after receipt of the King's writ (<em>Significavit</em>) commanding him to do so. This enactment, which an Anglican <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in recent times has aptly described as "the Magna Charta of tyranny" remains in force to the present day. Within the last few years the Law Courts have ruled that no opposition to the episcopal confirmation of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> nominated by the Crown can be allowed. </ul>

<p>Thus the chief note of Henrician settlement is the fact that Anglicanism was founded in the acceptance of the Royal, and the rejection of the Papal Supremacy, and was placed upon a decidedly Erastian basis.

<p>When the Act of Royal Supremacy, which had been repealed by <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, was revived by Elizabeth, it suffered a modification in the sense that the Sovereign was styled "Supreme Governor" instead of "Supreme Head". In a subsequent "Admonition", Elizabeth issued an interpretation of the Royal Supremacy, to the effect that she laid claim "to no power of ministry of divine offices in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". At the same time she reasserted in the full the claim made by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> as to the Authority of the Crown in matters <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, and the great religious changes made after her accession were carried out and enforced in a royal visitation commissioned by the royal authority.

<p>In 1628, Charles I, in a Royal Declaration prefixed to the Articles, stated that it belonged to the kingly office "to conserve and maintain the Church committed to our charge, in unity of religion and the bond of peace", and decreed that differences arising as to the external policy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were to be settled in Convocation, but its ordinances were to be submitted to the Crown for approval, which would be given to them if they were not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the land.

<p>Archbishop Laud, in 1640, had a series of canons drawn up in Convocation and duly published, but this attempt at spiritual independence was speedily suppressed. The indignation of Parliament was so great that he himself begged leave to withdraw them, and the House of Commons passed a resolution unanimously declaring that "the Clergy in Convocation assembled has no power to make any canons or constitutions whatsoever in matters of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> or otherwise to bind the Clergy and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of the land without the common consent in Parliament" (Resolution, 16 December, 1640).
<h3>The effect of Royal Supremacy</h3>

<p>The effect of the legislation under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, revived by Elizabeth, and confirmed in subsequent reigns, has been, as Lord Campbell pointed out in his famous Gorham judgment, in April, 1850, to locate in the Crown all that decisive <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> had been exercised by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>.

<p>Until the year 1833, the Crown exercised this supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> through a special body called the Court of Delegates. Its members were appointed under the great Seal, and consisted of lay judges, with whom might be associated a number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>. In 1833 this Court was abolished, and its powers were transferred to the King in Council. Hence matters which come under its purview are now decided by the King upon the advice of that part of the Privy Council which is known as the Judicial Committee. The statute (2 and 3 William IV, xcii) expressly states that its decisions are final, and are not subject to any commission of review.

<p>It must be observed that this tribunal does not profess theoretically to decide <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a>, or to pronounce upon the abstract <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a> of opinions. "Its <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> extends only to the consideration of that which is by law established to be the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, upon the due and legal construction of there Articles and formularies" (Gorham decision, March 1850). But upon this ground the Crown decided that the views of Mr. Gorham, whose <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> rejection of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> regeneration had shocked his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> the Tractarians, were "not contrary or repugnant to the declared <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as by law established". Numerous protests and appeals were made by high Churchmen, but all attempts to reverse the decision were unavailing, and Mr. Gorham duly received institution to the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> which his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had refused him. In like manner in 1849, when vehement opposition was made to the appointment of Dr. Hampden to the <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">See of Hereford</a>, the Prime Minister of the day insisted on the right of the Crown, and the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> ruled that no exception could be suffered against one whom the Crown had duly nominated, and the Court of Queen's Bench sustained his ruling.

<p>Thus, whatever views or aspirations have been held theoretically by Anglican divines on the spiritual authority of the Anglican Church, the Royal Supremacy remains an effective reality, and the Crown, supported by Parliament and the Law Courts, both as to the doctrines which may be taught, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who shall be put in office to teach them, has possession of the practical and substantial control. It is characteristic of the Anglican <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> that the supreme and far reaching regulative <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which was exercised by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was, after the severance from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, taken over, to all intents and purposes, by the Crown, and was never effectively entrusted to the Anglican Spirituality, either to the Primate, or to the Episcopate, or even to Convocation. As a result, there is to this day the lack of a living Church Spiritual Authority which has been to the Anglican Church a constant source of weakness, humiliation, and disorder.

<p>In 1904 a royal commission was appointed to investigate the complaints against <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, and in July 1906, it issued its report, in which it points out that at no time in the past have the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of public worship been uniformly observed, and recommends the formation of a Court which while exercising the Royal Jurisdiction, would be bound to accept the episcopate on questions of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or ritual. This, if granted, would be the first step towards the partial emancipation of the Spirituality from the thraldom of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, in which it has been held for more than three centuries.

<p>It will be observed that Anglicanism as a religious system is separable from the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Royal Supremacy, which is an outcome of its union with the State, and of the circumstances of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. In countries outside of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> Anglican Churches exist, and, it is said, all the more prosperously from being untrammelled by the State connection. But even in those countries the decisive voice in the government of the Anglican Church is not entrusted to the Episcopate alone, and in some of them the lay power in the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> has made itself felt, and has shown that it can be as really a master as any Tudor sovereign invested with royal supremacy. The supremacy of the Spirituality in the domain of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as the sole guarantee of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religious liberty, is still lacking in the Anglican system, and the problem of supplying it remains unsolved, if not insoluble.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> position of the Anglican Church, in like manner, can only be adequately studied in its history, which divides itself into a number of stages or periods. The first, or Henrician, period (1534-47) includes the breach with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the setting up of an independent national church, and the transfer of the supreme Church authority from the Papacy to the Crown. The Edwardian (1547-53) and the Elizabethan (1558-1603) periods carried the work of separation much further. Both accepted the Henrician basis of rejection of the Papacy and erection of the Royal Supremacy, but built upon it the admission of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> changes which make up mainly the Anglican <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and brought the nation within the great <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> movement of the sixteenth century.
<h3>First period: Henry VIII (1534-1547)</h3>

<p>Although the policy of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, after the breach with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was ostensibly conservative, and his ideal seemed to be the maintenance of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, minus the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, it is incontestable that in other ways his action was in fatal contradiction to his professions.

<p><em>Influence of English Protestant Sympathizers. &mdash;</em> By raising to power, and by maintaining in positions of unique influence, his three great agents, Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Cranmer, and Edward Seymour, all of whom were always, and as openly as they dared, in sympathy with the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, whether by intention or the by the indifference of his latter days, undoubtedly prepared the way and opened the gates to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> which came in under Edward and Elizabeth.

<p><em>Influence of German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. &mdash;</em> In 1535 Henry sent agents to negotiate an agreement with the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and in 1537 he was led by Cromwell, in connivance with Cranmer, into further negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes assembled at Smalkald. He wrote to <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> to congratulate him on the work which he had done for religion, and invited him to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> was unable to come, but in 1538 three German divines, Burkhardt, Boyneburg, and Myconius, were sent to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where they remained some months, and held conferences with the Anglican <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The Germans presented as a basis of agreement a number of Articles based on the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Confession of Augsburg. On the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> part of these Articles, the first thirteen, both parties came to an agreement (Letter of Myconius to Cromwell, 8 September, 1538). On the second part, the "Abuses" (viz., private Masses, <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the Clergy</a>, invocation of Saints) the King would not give way, and finally dissolved the conference. Although the negotiations thus formally came to an end, the Thirteen Articles on which agreement with the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> had been made were kept by Archbishop Cranmer, and afterwards by Archbishop Parker, and were used as test articles to which the preachers whom they licensed were required to subscribe. Eventually they became the nucleus of the Articles of Religion which were authorized under Edward VI and Elizabeth. Hence the almost verbal correspondence between these Articles and the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Confession of Augsburg, from which they were originally taken.
<h3>Second period: Edward VI (1547-1553)</h3>

<p>By the death of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> (27 January, 1547) the main obstacle to the reforming influence was removed. With the accession of Edward VI, who had been brought up in the reformed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with Seymour, also a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> in the Council, and Cranmer, now able to show his hand and work his will, the party of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> became possessed of all the resources of national power, and during the five years of the reign (1547-53) remained triumphantly in the ascendant. This period witnessed the introduction of the great <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> changes.

<p><em>Denial of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. &mdash;</em> One of the cardinal principles of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> which the German delegates had brought over in 1538 was that "the Mass is nothing but a Communion or synaxis" (Tunstall's Summary, M.S. Cleop. E. V., 209). Cranmer vehemently upheld this conception of the Eucharist. One of the first Acts under Edward VI was the introduction of a new English Communion Service, which was to be inserted at the end of the Mass, and which required Communion to be given under both kinds. This was soon after followed by a <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a>, with a Communion Service entirely taking the place of the Latin Mass. Cranmer was the chief author of this book. Whether it ever received the assent of Convocation has been questioned, but it was approved by Parliament in 1549. Gardiner, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, in opposing Cranmer's denial of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> and of the Sacrifice of the mass, argued that even certain passages in the new <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer Book</a> implied the acceptance of these doctrines; whereupon Cranmer and his fellow-reformers drew up a new <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer Book</a>, still more <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> in tone and character. In it the order of the parts of the Communion Service was considerably altered, and the passages used by Gardiner as apparently favouring the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> were studiously eliminated, or so changed as to preclude in future any such interpretation, and all allusion to Altar or Sacrifice was carefully omitted (Gasquet and Bishop, Edward VI and the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a>, 289). In 1552, this, the second <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer Book</a> of Edward VI, was authorized by Parliament. A new Ordinal or Order for making <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> was compiled, from which in like manner all mention of the sacrificial office of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was rigorously excluded. It was approved by Parliament in 1552. In 1551, quite in harmony with this <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> reform, an Order in Council issued to Bishop Ridley required the altars to be torn down, and movable tables substituted, while a statement of reasons was to be made to the people explanatory of the change, namely, "that the form of a table may more move and turn the simple from the old <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of the Mass and to the right use of the Lord's Supper".

<p><em>Suppression of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> practices. &mdash;</em> By Royal Proclamations and episcopal visitations, a multitude of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> practices and <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>, such as lights, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, and palms, were suppressed. These reforms, proceeding tentatively but rapidly, were initiated and carried out mainly by Cranmer and his set, and the reflected his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and that of this fellow-reformers.

<p><em>The 42 Articles. &mdash;</em> In 1553, a royal decree was issued requiring the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to subscribe forty-two Articles of Religion which embodied in great part what had been contained in the Thirteen Articles agreed upon with the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>. The article on the Eucharist had been significantly changed to agree, as Hooper attests, with the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> reformer, Bullinger.
<h3>Third period: Elizabeth I (1558-1603)</h3>

<p>In November, 1558, Queen Elizabeth succeeded <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, and immediately proceeded to restore the work of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> and Edward VI.

<p><em>Based on <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book of 1552. &mdash;</em> The new settlement of religion was based, not on the First <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book of 1549, but on the more <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> one of 1552. The latter was adopted with a few slight modifications, and it remains for the most part substantially unchanged to the present day. The statement that <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> offered to approve the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book is devoid of all historical foundation. It has not a vestige of contemporary evidence to support it. Camden, the earliest Anglican historian who mentions it, says: "I never could find it in any writing, and I do not believe any writing of it to exist. To gossip with the mop is unworthy of any historian" (History, 59). Fuller, another Anglican historian, describes it as the mere conjecture "of those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to feign what they cannot find".

<p><em>The 39 Articles. &mdash;</em> In 1563 the Edwardian Articles were revised in Convocation under Archbishop Parker. Some were added, others altered or dropped, and the number was reduced to Thirty-eight. In 1571, the XXIXth Article, despite the opposition of Bishop Guest, was inserted, to the effect that the wicked do not eat the Body of Christ. The Articles, thus increased to Thirty-nine, were ratified by the Queen, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were required to assent and subscribe thereto.

<p><em>Calvinistic Influence. &mdash;</em> During the whole of Elizabeth's long reign, the prevailing tone of Anglican teaching and literature was decidedly Genevan and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> (Dr. Prothero, English Hist. Rev., October, 1886). In 1662 a reaction set in against <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritanism</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book, which had been suppressed during the Commonwealth, was brought back and subjected to revision in Convocation and Parliament. The amendments made were numerous, but those of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> significance were comparatively few, and of a kind to emphasize the Episcopal character of Anglicanism as against <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterianism</a>. The most notable were the reinsertion, with altered wording, of the Black Rubric (omitted by Elizabeth) and the introduction in the form of the words, "for the office of a Bishop" and "for the office of a Priest", in the Service of Ordination.

<p><em>Anglican Formularies. &mdash;</em>

<p>The historic meaning and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> significance of the Anglican formularies can only be determined by the candid and competent examination of the evidence as a whole, <ul> <li>first, by the study of the plain meaning of the text; <li>secondly, by the study of the historical setting and the circumstances in which they were framed and authorized; <li>thirdly, by the known <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of their chief authors and of those by whom they were accepted; <li>fourthly, by comparison with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pre-Reformation formularies which they supplanted; <li>fifthly, by the study of their sources and the exact value of their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> terminology as found in the controversies of the time; <li>sixthly&mdash;if the examination is not to be hopelessly narrow&mdash;by the study of general <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, albeit with local and national characteristics, was both a part and a result. </ul> Here it is only possible to state the conclusions arising from such an inquiry in briefest outline.
<h2>Connection with the parent movement of Reformation</h2>

<p>There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> is substantially a part of the great <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> upheaval of the sixteenth century, and that its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, liturgy, and chief promoters were to a very considerable extent derived from, and influenced by, the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> movements on the Continent.
<h3>First bond: personal</h3>

<p>There was first of all the living or personal connection. The great <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> who took the leading part in the work of <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> &mdash; Cranmer, Barlow, Hooper, Parker, Grindal, Scory, May, Cox, Coverdale, and many others&mdash;were men who lived and laboured amongst the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of the Continent, and remained in constant and cordial touch and communication with them. (See <em>Original Letters of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a></em>.) Reciprocally, continental reformers, like Peter Martyr and <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Martin Bucer</a>, were welcomed to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and made professors of Divinity at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. Others, like John a Lasco, and Paul Fagius, become the friends and guests of Cranmer.
<h3>Second bond: doctrinal</h3>

<p>A second bond was the adoption of the same essential doctrines. The great principles and tenets set forth in the works of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, or <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, are reproduced with or without modifications, but substantially, and often almost verbatim in the literature of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The chief doctrines which are essentially and specifically characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> as a whole are the following nine: <ul> <li>rejection of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Papacy</a>, <li>denial of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">Infallibility</a>; <li>Justification by Faith only; <li>supremacy and sufficiency of Scripture as Rule of Faith; <li>the triple Eucharistic tenet [viz. (<em>a</em>) that the Eucharist is a Communion or Sacrament, and not a Mass or Sacrifice, save in the sense of praise or commemoration; (<em>b</em>) the denial of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> and worship of the Host; (<em>c</em>) the denial of the sacrificial office of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the propitiatory character of the Mass]; <li>the non-necessity of auricular Confession; <li>the rejection of the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and the Saints; <li>the rejection of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> and omission of <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a>; <li>the rejection of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>. </ul> To these may be added three disciplinary characteristics which are founded on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>: <ul> <li>the giving of Communion in both kinds; <li>the substitution of tables for altars; and <li>the abolition of <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a>. </ul> These twelve doctrines and practices of the continental <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> have undoubtedly, though not always in the same measure, entered into the fibre of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and have all found expression, more or less emphatic, in the Anglican formularies. Hence, while the name <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">"Protestant"</a> is not found in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book, it is used in the Coronation Service when the King promises to maintain "the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant religion</a> as by law established". It was from the beginning popularly applied to the Anglican <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and services. In the Act of Union the Churches of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> are styled <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">"the Protestant Episcopal Church"</a>, a name still retained by the Anglican Church in America.
<h3>Third bond: liturgical</h3>

<p>A third bond between the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> on the continent and that which took place in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is to be found in the actual composition of the formularies. The Anglican Articles owe much, through the Thirteen Articles, to the Confession of Augsburg, and also to the Confession of Wurtemberg. Notable portions of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a>, marriage, and confirmation services are derived from the "Simplex et Pia Deliberatio" which was compiled by the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Hermann von Wied, with the aid of <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>. That a considerable part of the Anglican ordinal (without the distinctive form for each Order) is found in <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer's</a> "Scripta Anglica", has been pointed out by the late Canon Travers Smith.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this triple bond&mdash;personal, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> &mdash; the continental and Anglican <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformations</a> are, amid many and notable differences, substantially and inseparably interwoven as parts of one and the same great religious movement.
<h2>Use of liturgical reform to deny the Sacrifice</h2>

<p>The comparison of the Anglican <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book and Ordinal with the Pre-Reformation formularies which they replaced leads to a second conclusion which in harmony with the above. On making an analysis of what has been removed, and what has been retained, and what has been altered, it becomes unmistakably apparent that the main motive which determined and guided the construction of the new liturgy was the same as that which inspired the whole <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> movement, namely: <em>the determination to have the Lord's Supper regarded only as a Sacrament or Communion, and not as a Sacrifice</em>, and to remove whatever indicated the sacrificial character of the Eucharist, or the Real, Objective Presence, in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense, in which Christ is worshipped in the Host.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> forms, <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missal</a>, breviary, pontifical, were in possession and had been in actual use for centuries. In making a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> reform, it was by the necessity of the case impossible that the changes made should not have reference to them, standing as they did, in the relation of <em>terminus a quo</em> to a <em>terminus ad quem</em> of reformation. If the Sarum <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and Pontifical are placed side by side with the Anglican <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book and Ordinal, and a comparison made of the corresponding parts, the motive, drift, and intention of the framers are clearly revealed. <ul> <li>In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Pontifical, in the Ordination services there are twenty-four passages which express with clearness the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <em>Sacerdotium</em>, or sacrificial character of the office and work of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Of these not one was allowed to remain in the Anglican Ordinal. <li>In the Ordinary of the Mass alone there are some twenty-five points in which the sacrificial nature of the Eucharist and the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence of Christ as a Victim</a> are expressed or implied. All these have been suppressed and eliminated in the Anglican Communion Service, and passages of a Reformational or non-committal character substituted. </ul> Thus, with regard to no less than forty-nine places, the new formularies bear the mark of deliberate exclusion and of anti-sacrificial and anti-sacerdotal significance. (See <em>The Tablet</em>, London, 12 June, 1897.)
<h2>Development and parties</h2>

<p>Although the Anglican Articles and liturgy have been practically unchanged since 1662, it was inevitable that the life and thought of a religious body like the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> should present the note of development, and that such development should eventually out grow, or at least strain, the historic interpretation of the formularies, and the more so because there has been no living authority to adapt or readjust them to the newer needs or aspirations. The development may be said to have been guided by three main influences. <ul> <li>There has been the deep-seated attachment to the principles of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in which the Anglican settlement was founded, and the determination to preserve the standards of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and worship then established. This loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> character of the Anglican Church has produced the <a href="../cathen/09399a.htm">Low Church</a>, or Evangelical, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Anglicanism. <li>A second influence is that of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, which, both in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, has acted as a solvent of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, especially in the form of destructive biblical criticism, and which, often in the effort to sublimate religion, has induced an aversion to all that is dogmatic, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>. Its exponents, who are numerous, learned, and influential, are generally classed as the Broad Church, or the Latitudinarian, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Anglican <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> thought. <li>A third influence which made itself felt upon Anglicanism, and one more vital and more penetrating and progressive than the other two, has been that of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, whether as reflected in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> antiquity or as beheld in the actual <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The effect of this influence may be traced in what has been called the historic High Church party. A number of Anglican <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and divines in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, while bitterly opposed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and loyally <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, stood above the prevailing low level of churchmanship, and put forward higher and philocatholic views, in the matters of Church authority, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and worship. Although comparatively few in number, and vehemently assailed by their fellow <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a>, they were destined to serve as a <em>point d'appui</em> for a subsequent development. Such writers as Bishop Andrews (d. 1626), Bishop Overall (d. 1644), Bishop Montague (d. 1641), Archbishop Laud (d. 1644), Archbishop Bramhall (d. 1663), Dr. Thorndike (d. 1672), Bishop Ken (d. 1711), Dr Waterland (d. 1740), may be regarded as representative of this section. </ul>
<h2>Oxford Movement</h2>

<p>(See also <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">OXFORD MOVEMENT</a>.)

<p>In 1833 a strong current of popular opinion directed against the Anglican Church aroused in its defense the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of a small band of Oxford students and writers, who gradually gathered under the informal leadership of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">John Henry Newman.</a> Among these were John Keble, C. Marriott, Hurrell Froude, Isaac Williams, <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Dr. Pusey</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">W.G. Ward.</a> Their object was to make good for the Anglican Church its claim to the note of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>. Their task led them to look both behind and outside the sphere of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.

<p>By forming a catena of Anglican High Church divines of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries on one side, and a catena of certain Fathers on the other, it was hoped that a quasi-continuous chain of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> could be made to connect the Anglican Church of their day with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> antiquity. Translations of the Fathers, works on liturgy, the festivals of the "Christian Year", and above all a memorable series of "Tracts for the Times", conveyed with telling force the newer and broader conceptions of churchmanship which entered into the spirit of the defenders.

<p>In "Tract 90" an attempt was made, somewhat on the lines of <a href="../cathen/01056a.htm">Sancta Clara</a>, to show that the Anglican Articles might in certain aspects be reconciled to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The result was a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and devotional crisis such as <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had not witnessed since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and the Oxford or Tractarian movement, during the twelve years from Keble's sermon on "National Apostasy", in 1833, to <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> conversion in 1845, formed a historic epoch in the annals of Anglicanism. The fact that the work of the movement was informally a study <em>de Ecclesi&acirc;</em> brought both the writers and their readers more directly face to face with the claims of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>A large number of those who took part in the movement, and notably its great leader, became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, while others, in remaining Anglicans, gave a new and pro-Catholic direction and impulse to Anglican thought and worship. It may be said that in the case of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, <a href="../cathen/11173a.htm">Oakley</a>, <a href="../cathen/15620c.htm">Wilberforce</a>, <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a>, and a host of others, the research of the nature of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> brought them to realize the need of the living voice of a Divine magisterium (the <em>regula proxima fidei</em>), and failing to find it in the Anglican episcopate, they sought it where alone it could be found.

<p>Others, like <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a>, Marriott, Keble, sought what they called the voice of the "Church" in the inanimate formularies (or <em>regula remota</em>) which, after all, was merely adding the Fathers, the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> definitions to the Scripture as the area over which they still used, after the manner of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, their private judgement. The same principle is always more or less at work and goes as far now as then to sift those who come from those who stay. [If we bear in mind that by "Church" was thus meant the silent self-interpreted formularies (or <em>regula remota</em>), and by "Bishops" the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">living magisterium</a> (or <em>regula proxima</em>) sought in Anglicanism, we shall feel that there is a great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> contained in <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey's</a> well-known saying, three years after the secession of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>: "I am not disturbed, because I never attached any weight to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. It was perhaps the difference between <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> and me. He threw himself upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and they failed him. I threw myself on the English Church and the Fathers, as under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, her support" (Letter to C. Marriott, 2 January, 1848)].
<h2>Anglican revival</h2>

<p>Although the Oxford movement is regarded as having come to a close at the conversion of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Dr. Newman</a> in 1845, a large section of the Anglican public had been much too profoundly stirred by its ideals ever to return to the narrowness of the religious horizons which were bounded by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Its influence has survived in the unceasing flow of converts to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and is shown in the Anglican Church itself by the notable change of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, temperament, and practice which is known as the Anglican Revival.

<p>The last fifty years (1860-1910) have witnessed the development of an influential and growing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> thought which, amid the inconsistencies of its position, has steadily laboured to Catholicize the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It has set up the claim, hopelessly untenable in the face of historical evidence, that the Anglican Church is one and continuous with the Ancient <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the country, and is an integral portion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of today. It professes to be able to give to Anglicans all that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gives to her members, save communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Through possessing neither the learning nor the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of the Tractarians, it exercises a wider and more practical influence, and has won the favour of a large body of the Anglican public by importing into the Anglican services something of the beauty and power which it has borrowed from <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> and ritual. At the same time it has in many centers earned the respect and attachment of the masses by the example of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and self-sacrifice given by its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<p>It was natural that this advance section of the Anglican Church should seek to ratify its position, and to escape from its fatal isolation, by desiring some scheme of corporate reunion and especially by endeavouring to obtain some recognition of the <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">validity of its orders</a>. With the truest charity, which consists in the candour of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> on Unity, pointed out that there can be no reunion expect on the solid basis of dogmatic unity and submission to the divinely instituted authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. In September, 1896, after a full and exhaustive inquiry, he issued a <a href="../cathen/01644a.htm">Bull</a> declaring <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican Orders</a> to be "utterly null and void", and in a subsequent <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> addressed to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he required all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to accept this judgment as "fixed, settled, and irrevocable" (<em>firmum, ratum et irrevocabile</em>).

<p>The Anglican Revival continues to reiterate its claim and to appropriate to itself, where practical, whatever in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, liturgy, and practice, church vestments or church furniture, it finds helpful to its purpose. By the Lambeth judgment of 1891 it acquired a public sanction for many of its innovations. Since then it has gone further, and holds that no authority in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> can override things which are authorized by "Catholic consent". It stands thus in the illogical and unhistorical position of a system which is philocatholic in its views and aspirations, but hopelessly committed to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> communication, and built upon an essentially <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> foundation. Although to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> its very claim is an impious usurpation of what belongs of right to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone, it fulfils an informal mission of influencing English public opinion, and of familiarizing the English people with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a> and ideals.

<p>Like the Oxford movement, it <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educates</a> more pupils than it can retain, and works upon premises which cannot but carry it in the long run farther than it is willing to go. A branch theory which is repudiated by the principal branches, or a province theory which is unknown to the rest of the provinces, and a continuity theory of which more than twelve thousand documents in the Record Office and the Vatican Library are the overwhelming refutation, cannot form a standing ground which is other than temporary and transitional. In the meantime, its work amongst the masses is often a species of catechumenate for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and in all cases it is an active solvent and a steady undoing of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the world (1910) is said to exceed 230,000,000 (estimates by M. Fournier de Flaix, see The American Statistical Association Quarterly for March 1892). The number belonging to the Greek and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> is about 100,000,000. The number of Anglicans in all countries is something less than 25,000,000. Thus the relative proportion of those three <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> bodies which are sometimes grouped as being Episcopalian in constitution may be fairly stated by the three figures 23, 10, 2.5. The growth of Anglicanism has followed mainly upon the expansion of the Anglo-Saxon race. Its area may be said to include, besides the three nucleal countries (<a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>), six others, namely: the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a>, South Africa, and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. But the bulk of its membership, in fact more than two-thirds, is to be found in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In all the other countries of its areas it is in a minority of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population. In five of them&mdash;<a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> &mdash; its numbers are considerably exceeded by those of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Its foreign missions are very generously supported, and have extended their activity far into the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> countries. The following table is compiled from comparatively recent statistics. The numbers given are of members, except when it is stated to be of communicants. The ratio of communicants to members may be anything between 1 in 3 and 1 in 8.</p>

<table summary="Table"> <tr><td>COUNTRY</td><td>TOTAL<br>CHRISTIAN<br>POPULATION</td><td>NUMBER OF ANGLICANS</td></tr> <tr><td>England</td><td> 32,526,075</td><td> Between 13 and 17 millions or 2,223,207 communicants</td></tr> <tr><td>Ireland</td><td> 4,458,775</td><td> 581,089</td></tr> <tr><td>Scotland</td><td> 4,472,103</td><td> 134,155 (Epis.

<p>The foregoing statistics concerning the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and her dependencies are, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a> and New Zealand, taken from the Census, 1901 (British Empire Official Year Book, which is also to be consulted for the Anglican population of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>). The figures for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> populations of <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, in 1901, and New Zealand are given respectively in "Whitaker's Almanac", 1906, which includes 6,851 aborigines, and the "New Zealand year Book", 1904, which excludes the Maoris. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> is based on the Abstract of the twelfth Census, and that of South Africa on the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> population, 1904, as contained in "Whitaker's Almanac", 1906. For several decades there has been no return of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denominations</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government Census. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is popularly estimated to include about 17,000,000. Its official "Year Book" (1906), which is also the authority for the number of communicants in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and South Africa, gives the number of communicants in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, as 2,223,207. This multiplied by 6 would give a membership of 13,339,242. The same authority give the number of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> as 615,621. This, upon the usual multiple of 22.5, would give a membership of 13,860,000. The number belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> would thus seem to be between thirteen and seventeen millions. For the number of Anglicans in Australia in 1901, refer again to "Whitaker's Almanac", 1906.
