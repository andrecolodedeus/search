<h1>Angora</h1>  

<p>Armenian <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> (Asiatic Turkey).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> now call Angora, and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, Enguru, the ancient capital of Galatia, in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, which was known to the Greeks and Romans as Ancyra. Midas was its legendary founder, and it witnessed the triumphal march of Alexander the Great. Under the <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucid</a> king, Antiochus III (222-186 B. c.) it lost temporarily its freedom. It was the capital of the Galatian kings, Dejotarus and Amyntas. When the latter died (25 B.C.), it became a Roman city and was very flourishing under <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> permitted its capture by the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> in A.D. 619; later it was often ravaged by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, who were in turn dispossessed by the Seldjucids of Konia. Though taken by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a>, its possession was long the disputed by <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, and it finally fell into the hands of Sultan Mourad, in 1362. Since then it has remained in the power of the Ottoman <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, with the exception of some years after the battle of 2 July, 1402, in which Sultan Bajazet was killed by TimourLeng (Tamerlane) and his Mongols, and six months in 833, when Ibrahim Pasha, the son of the Khedive Mehemet-Ali, led the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> troops as far as the Bosphorus. Though the chief town of the vilayet, or district, of the same name, the modern Angora no longer reminds us of the glory of ancient Ancyra. It can show, however, besides a, great many inscriptions, the ruins of several Roman monuments, among them the famous temple of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, on whose walls is inscribed in marble the will of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, with the principal events of his reign (<em>Monumentum Ancyranum</em>). Ancyra was at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> city, and counts several <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; the best known are the Bishop St. Clement, whose memory is preserved by a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> church, and the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> St. Theodotus. Unhappily, neither the Acts of Clement nor those of Theodotus can claim high rank as historical documents. After the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Maximinus (probably in 314) Ancyra witnessed an important council whose twenty-five canons are yet extant. Marcellus, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, was prominent in the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> controversy, likewise his successor Basil (d. 373). Among the other Metropolitans of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> special mention is due to <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, who took part in the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenist</a> controversies during the sixth century. The actual population of Angora comprises 18,000 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, 16,000 Orthodox Greeks, 5,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, 100 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, 400 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Greek</a> community is governed by a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and has 2 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, and 2 for girls. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> community is organized as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and has 4 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for men, 1 for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, and 1 for girls. The Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> community is governed by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and has 2 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys, and 1 for girls. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> have 1 church, and form a missionary station under the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, directed from C&aelig;sarea. The little Latin colony, attracted by the railway, is visited by the <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Augustinians of the Assumption</a>, missionaries at Eski-Chehir. Angora also possesses a prosperous French establishment conducted the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">ANCYRA</a>).
