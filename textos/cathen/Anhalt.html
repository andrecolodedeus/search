<h1>Anhalt</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariate Apostolic</a> comprising the territory of the German Duchy of Anhalt, with an area of 860 square miles. It contained, 1 December, 1905, 328,029 inhabitants: 13,493 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 311,999 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 1,460 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and 1,077 members of other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar apostolic</a> is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> who names the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of the vicariate. There are four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>: Dessau, Bernburg, Coethen, and Zerbst; also three missions (filialkirchen) with a total of ten <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The "Grey Nuns" from the mother-house in Breslau are the only <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order in Anhalt. They have two establishments for visiting nurses in Dessau and Coethen, in charge of twenty-one sisters, and also conduct a kindergarten and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for first communicants in Coethen. The public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are under the direction of the State, yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, with the permission and support of the government, maintains sixteen private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and fifteen teachers, with about nine hundred children in average attendance. Before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, the territory comprised under the present <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate apostolic</a> belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a>, and Merseburg. The few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who remained true to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> after the fall of these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, received little attention from the Roman <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, to which they were subject until after 1622. In 1719 the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of the Saxon province of their order established a mission in Dessau; in 1805, Duke Friedrich Franz gave it a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and in 1807 permission to hold divine services in public. A mission was founded at Zerbst in 1773, and at Coethen in 1816. Duke Ferdinand of Coethen and his wife became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 24 October, 1825, and established at Coethen in place of the mission, a congregation under the direction of <a href="../cathen/02382b.htm">Father Beckx, S.J.</a>* <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Pope Leo XII</a> raised this to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> (17 May, 1826) and placed it directly under the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, whose first representative was the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Saxony, <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Papal Nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> since 1827. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> remained in charge until 1848, since then the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> has been under <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Diocese of Paderborn</a>. The mission station at Dessau was made a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in 1830; the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Papal Nuncio</a> established <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> 2 June, 1859, in Bernburg and Zerbst, which were not recognized by the government of Anhalt until 1871, being founded without its consent. By the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Papal Brief</a> of the 17 March, 1868, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Anhalt became subject to Bishop Martin of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. Since that time with the approval of the government of Anhalt, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> undertakes the direction of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Anhalt as the "Apostolic Administrator of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the district of Anhalt." During the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Prussian Kulturkampf</a> after the death of Bishop Martin (16 July, 1879), the <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">see of Paderborn</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, the appointment of the temporary <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar apostolic</a> was assigned to the Nuncio at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>; Canon Drobe of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> and made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> in 1882 (d. March, 1891). His successors were Simar, (1892) and Schneider (1900).
