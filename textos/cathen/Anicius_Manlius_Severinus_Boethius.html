<h1>Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius</h1>  

<p>Roman statesman and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, often styled "the last of the Romans", regarded by tradition as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 480; died at Pavia in 524 or 525. Descended from a consular <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he was left an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> at an early age and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and noble-minded Symmachus, whose daughter, Rusticana, he married. As early as 507 he was known as a learned man, and as such was entrusted by <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">King Theodoric</a> with several important missions. He enjoyed the confidence of the king, and as a patrician of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was looked up to by the representatives of the Roman nobility. When, however, his enemies accused him of disloyalty to the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogothic</a> king, alleging that he plotted to restore "Roman liberty", and added the accusation of "sacrilege" (the practice of <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>), neither his noble birth nor his great popularity availed him. He was cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, condemned unheard, and executed by order of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>. During his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, he reflected on the instability of the favour of princes and the inconstancy of the devotion of his friends. These reflections suggested to him the theme of his best-known <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> work, the "De Consolatione Philosophiae".

<p>Tradition began very early to represent Boethius as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. It was believed that among the accusations brought against him was devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause, which at that time was championed by the Emperor Justin against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>. In the eighth century this tradition had assumed definite shape, and in many places Boethius was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and his feast observed on the twenty-third of October. In recent times, critical scholarship has gone to the opposite extreme, and there have not been wanting critics who asserted that Boethius was not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> at all, or that, if he was, he <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> the Faith before his death. The foundation for this opinion is the fact that in the "Consolations of Philosophy" no mention is made of Christ or of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. A saner view, which seems at the present time to be prevalent among scholars, is that Boethius was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and remained a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to the end.

<p>That he was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> tracts, some of which, as we shall see, are undoubtedly genuine. That he remained a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is the obvious inference from the ascertained fact of his continued association with Symmachus; and if the "Consolations of Philosophy" bears no trace of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> influence, the explanation is at hand in the fact that it is an entirely artificial exercise, a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> dialogue modelled on strictly <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> productions, a treatise in which, according to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of method which prevailed at the time, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> feeling and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thought had no proper place. Besides, even if we disregard certain allusions which some interpret in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sense, there are passages in the treatise which seem plainly to hint that, after philosophy has poured out all her consolations for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, there are more potent remedies (<em>validiora remedia</em>) to which he may have recourse. There can be no reasonable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, then, that Boethius died a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, though it is not easy to show from documentary sources that he died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The absence of documentary evidence does not, however, prevent us from giving due value to the constant tradition on this point. The local cult of Boethius at Pavia was sanctioned when, in 1883, the Sacred Congregation of Rites confirmed the custom prevailing in that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of honouring St. Severinus Boethius, on the 23rd of October.

<p>To the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of mathematics and the theory of music Boethius contributed the "De Institutione Arithmetic Libri II", "De Institutione Music Libri V", and "Geometria Euclidis a Boethio in Latinum translata". The last-mentioned work is found in various <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. There is also found among the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> a work "De Geometri", which, in its extant form, is considered to be a ninth- or tenth-century elaboration of a work of Boethius. How far the work is genuine, and to what extent interpolations have crept in, is a question of more than ordinary interest for the student of general history, for on the answer to this question depends the determination of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the first use of Arabic numerals in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Boethius' <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> works include: <ul><li>translations from the Greek, e.g. of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> treatises (with commentaries) and of Porphyry's "Isagogue" (with commentaries); <li>commentaries on Porphyry's "Isagoge", translated by Marius Victorinus and on Cicero's "Topica"; <li>original <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> treatises, "De Categoricis Syllogismis", "Introductio ad Syllogismos Categoricos", "De Divisione" (of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity), and "De Differentiis Topicis".</ul> These exercised very great influence on the development of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> terminology, method, and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>. In fact, the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">schoolmen</a>, down to the beginning of the twelfth century, depended entirely on Boethius for their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> doctrines. They adopted his definitions and made them current in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; for instance, the definitions of "person", "eternity", etc.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works of Boethius include "De Trinitate"; two short treatises (<em>opuscula</em>) addressed to <a href="../cathen/08491a.htm">John the Deacon</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/08421a.htm">Pope John I</a>); "Liber contra Eutychen et Nestorium"; and "De Fide Catholica" (generally regarded as spurious, although the only argument against its genuineness is the lack of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> authority). These were much studied in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, as is testified by the number of glosses found in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> as far back as the ninth century (e.g. glosses by John <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Erigena and Remi of Auxerre). To the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> generally they appealed as the genuine works of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Boethius. In modern times, those who denied that Boethius was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> were, of course, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to reject the opuscula as spurious. However, the publication of the so-called "Anecdoton Holderi" (ed. by Usener, Leipzig, 1877) brought to light a new argument for their genuineness. For, as <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> ought certainly to have known which works of Boethius were genuine, when he wrote "[Boethius] scripsit librum de Sanct Trinitate et capita quaedam dogmatica et librum contra Nestorium", he settled the question as far as four of the treatises are concerned.

<p>Boethius' best-known work is the "Consolations of Philosophy" written during his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> &#151; "by far the most interesting example of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> literature the world has ever seen." It is a dialogue between Philosophy and Boethius, in which the Queen of Sciences strives to console the fallen statesman. The main argument of the discourse is the transitoriness and unreality of all earthly greatness and the superior desirability of the things of the mind. There are evident traces of the influence of the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonists</a>, especially of Proclus, and little, if anything, that can be said to reflect <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> influences. The recourse to <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoicism</a>, especially to the doctrines of Seneca, was inevitable, considering the nature of the theme. It does astonish the modern reader, although, strange to say, it did not surprise the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> student, that Boethius, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and, as everyone in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> believed, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, should have failed, in his moment of trial and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> stress to refer to the obvious <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sources of consolation. Perhaps the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> student of Boethius understood better than we do that a strictly formal dialogue on the consolation of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> should adhere rigorously to the realm of "natural <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" and leave out of consideration the lesson to be derived from the moral maxims of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> &#151; "supernatural <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>".

<p>The work takes up many problems of <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> as well as of ethics. It treats of the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">Being and Nature of God</a>, of providence and fate, of the origin of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and of the freedom of the will. In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a>, it became one of the most popular and influential <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> books, a favourite study of statesmen, poets, and historians, as well as of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. It was translated into Anglo-Saxon by <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">King Alfred the Great</a>, and into Old German by <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker Teutonicus</a>; its influence may be traced in Beowulf and in <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucer</a>, in Anglo-Norman and Proven&ccedil;al popular poetry, in the first specimens of Italian verse, as well as in the "Divina Commedia". The important part which it played in <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> struggle after the death of Beatrice is described in the "Convito", where, strange to say, it is referred to as "a book not known to many". Echoes of it and citations from it occur frequently in the "Divina Commedia". For instance, the lines which Tennyson paraphrases by "a sorrow's crown of sorrow" are themselves at least a haunting memory of Boethius' "In omni adversitate fortunae infelicissimum genus est infortunii fuisse felicem" (De Consol. Phil., II, Pros. IV). That the "De Consolatione" was a favourite study of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> as well as of the poets is evidenced by the numerous imitations under the title "De Consolatione Theologiae" which were widely read during the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.
