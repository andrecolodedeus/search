<h1>Anima Christi</h1>  

<p>This well-known <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> its origin from the first half of the fourteenth century and was enriched with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> in the year 1330. All the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> practically agree as to these two facts so there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of their exactness. In regard to its authorship all we can say is that it was, perhaps, written by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>. Of this we are not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, as this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> has been falsely accredited with similar <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> compositions, and a mistake could easily be made of confounding the one who gave the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> with the real author. The <em>Anima Christi</em> was and is still generally believed to have been composed by <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>, as he puts it at the beginning of his "Spiritual Exercises" and often refers to it. This is a mistake, as has been pointed out by many writers, since the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> has been found in a number of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> books printed during the youth of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and is in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which were written a hundred years before his birth (1491). James Mearns, the English <a href="../cathen/07596a.htm">hymnologist</a>, found it in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the British Museum which dates back to about 1370. In the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> there is preserved a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book of Cardinal Peter De Luxembourg, who died in 1387, which contains the <em>Anima Christi</em> in practically the same form as we have it today. It has also been found inscribed on one of the gates of the Alcazar of Seville, which brings us back to the times of Don Pedro the Cruel (1350-69) This <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was so well known and so popular at the time of St. Ignatius, that he only mentions it in the first edition of his "Spiritual Exercises", evidently supposing that the exercitant or reader already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it. In the later editions, it was printed in full. It was by assuming that everything in the book was written by St. Ignatius that it came to be looked upon as his composition. All this has been told at length by Guido Dreves (Stimmen aus Maria-Laach LIV, 493) and B. Baesten (Pr&eacute;cis Historiques, XXXII, 630).
