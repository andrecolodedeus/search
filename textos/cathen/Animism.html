<h1>Animism</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <em>Anima,</em> Soul)

<p>Animism is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or theory of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In current language the term has a twofold signification: <br>I. PHILOSOPHICAL--the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the principle of life in man and in other living things. As applied to man it embodies the essence of spiritualistic as opposed to <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialistic</a> philosophy. <br>II. ETHNOLOGICAL--a theory proposed in recent years to account for the origin and development of religion. As such it is known as the Soul or Ghost-theory of religion.
<h2 id="section1">Philosophical</h2>

<p>For the application of the theory of animism to living things in general, see <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">LIFE</a>. So far as it is specially concerned with man, animism aims at a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of man's nature and dignity by establishing the existence and nature of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, its union with the body, its origin and duration. These problems are at the basis of our conscious existence and underlie all our studies in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> and moral life. The importance of animism today is shown because; <ol><li>its validity as a theory has been questioned; <li>a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has risen which treats <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> without reference to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; hence the attempt at "<a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> without a soul", e.g. Sully, James, Murray, Davis, K&oelig;lpe, H&ouml;ffding.</ol>

<p>In establishing the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of animism the general line of reasoning is from effect to cause, from phenomena to their subject or agent. From the acts of mind and of will manifested in individual conscious life, we are forced to admit the existence of their source and principle, which is the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; from the nature of the activity is inferred the nature of the agent. <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a>, with <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Christian Fathers</a>, vindicates the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> dignity of man by proclaiming the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be a substantial and spiritual principle endowed with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a substance because it has the elements of being, potency, stability, and is the subject of modifications--which elements make up the notion of substance. That the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a spiritual substance, i.e. immaterial and a spirit, is inferred from its acts of intelligence and of freewill, which are performed without the intrinsic cooperations of the bodily organs. By <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> is understood in general terms the future life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after separation from the body. The chief <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> are those which contend; <ol><li>that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not a substance. Thus <ul><li>some writers, e.g. <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, hold that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not a real, but only a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, subject; <li>modern <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, seem especially in New England Transcendentalism (e.g. Emerson, Royce) and the Neo-Hegelian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which unifies human and divine consciousness (e.g. Prof. T. H. Green); <li>the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Associationists (e.g. Hume, Davis, H&ouml;ffding, Sully), who contend that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is only a bundle or group of sensations; <li>those who teach that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is only activity, nothing more (Wundt), or "a wave of consciousness" (Morgan); <li>the <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostic</a> and Positivistic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (e.g. Locke, Spencer, James, Prof. Bowne, Comte), who affirm that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is unknown and unknowable, although some among them postulate it as the subject of our conscious states; <li>the materialistic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which denies its existence altogether (e.g. Tyndall, Huxley)</ul> <li>That the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is neither spiritual, nor <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. Modern <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a>, Positivism, and <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a> have tried in every way to establish this thesis. Various theories of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> have been proposed, and the discoveries of modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> have been cited in its behalf. Appeal has been taken to psychophysics and to such facts as the localization of function, the correlation of thought to the structure of the brain, and the results of cerebral lesion. Theories of Monism (e.g. the double-aspect theory) and of Parallelism have been advanced to account for the acts of mind and of will. Yet animism as a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the spiritual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remains unshattered, and the spiritualistic philosophy is only more strongly entrenched. (Cf. <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">SUBSTANCE</a>, <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">AGNOSTICISM</a> <a href="../cathen/12312c.htm">POSITIVISM</a>, <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">MATERIALISM</a>, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">SOUL</a>, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">IMMORTALITY</a>, <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">PSYCHOLOGY</a>).</ol>
<h2 id="section2">Ethnological</h2>

<p>In this sense animism is the theory proposed by some evolutionists to account for the origin of religion. Evolution assumes that the higher civilized races are the outcome and development from a ruder state. This early stage resembles that of the lowest savages existing today. Their religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is known as animism, i.e. <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in spiritual beings, and represents the minimum or rudimentary definition of religion. With this postulate as the groundwork for the philosophy of religion, the development of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> thought can be traced from existing data and therefore admits of scientific treatment. The principle of continuity, which is the basal principle in other departments of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, was thus applied to religion. Comte had given a general outline of this theory in his law of the three states. According to him the conception of the primary <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> condition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> is a state of "pure <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">fetishism</a>, constantly characterized by the free and direct exercise of our primitive tendency to conceive all external bodies soever, natural or artificial, as animated by a life essentially analogous to our own, with mere difference of intensity". Proposed at a time when evolution was in the ascendency, this opinion fell at once under the dominion of the current conviction. The hope was entertained that by a wider and more complete induction religion might be considered as a purely natural phenomenon and thus at last be placed on a scientific basis.



<p>The foundation of animism as a theory of religion is the twofold principle of evolution: <ol><li>the anthropological assumption that the savage races give a correct <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of religion in its primitive state; <li>the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> assumption that the savage state was the childhood of the race and that the savage mind should be likened to a child (e.g. Lubbock, Tylor, Comte, Tiele, Reville, and Spencer).</ol> Hence the evolution of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> thought can be traced from existing data, viz, the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of the lowest savages, and though deeply modified as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> rises in culture, yet it always preserves an unbroken continuity into the midst of modern civilization. This <em>continuum</em>, or common element, in all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> is animism. The importance of animism in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of religion is due to Tylor, who represents it as a primitive philosophy supplying at the same time the foundation of all religion. His work entitled "Primitive Culture", first published in 1863, is justly called the "Gospel of Animism". Animism comprehends the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and spirits, but has its starting point in the former. Dreams and visions, apparitions in sleep and at death, are supposed to have revealed to primitive man his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as distinct from his body. This <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> was then transferred to other objects. As the human body was believed to live and act by virtue of its own inhabiting spirit-soul, so the operations of the world seemed to be carried on by other spirits. To the savage mind, animals, plants, and all inanimate things have <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. From this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> arises the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in spirits. Spirits are of the same nature as <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, only separated from bodies--e.g. genii, fairies, demons--and acting in different ways as tutelary guardians, lingering near the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> or roaming about (Spiritism), or incorporated in certain objects (<a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>, <a href="../cathen/14789a.htm">Totemism</a>). They appear to man in a more subtle material form as vapour, or as an image retaining a likeness to the bodily shape; and they are feared by him, so that he tries to control their influence by propitiation and magic (<a href="../cathen/13750a.htm">Shamanism</a>). Thus unconsciousness, sickness, derangement, trance were explained by the departure of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Among savages and <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> Tatars the bringing back of lost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> was a regular part of the sorcerer's profession. The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> prevails among the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">American Indians</a> that if one wakes a sleeper suddenly he will die, as his vagrant <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may not get back in time. For the savage, as the lowest of men, is supposed to be actuated by the lowest of passions. Hence the fear-theory of religion is essential to animism.

<p>Animism therefore discovers <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> in all moving things. To the savage and to primitive man there is no distinction between the animate and the inanimate. Nature is all alive. Every object is controlled by its own independent spirit. Spirits are seen in the rivers, the lakes, the fountains, the woods, the mountains, the trees, the animals, the flowers, the grass, the birds. Spiritual existences--e.g. elves, gnomes, ghosts, manes, demons, <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>--inhabit almost everything, and consequently almost everything is an object of worship. The Milky Way is "the path of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> leading to the spirit-land"; and the Northern Lights are the dances of the dead warriors and seers in the realms above. The Australians say that the sounds of the wind in the trees are the voices of the ghosts of the dead communing with one another or warning the living of what is to come. The conception of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> formed from dreams and visions served as a type on which primitive man framed his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and of spiritual beings from the lowest elf up to the highest god. Thus the gods of the higher <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> have been evolved out of the spirits, whether ghosts or not, of the lower <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in ghosts and spirits was produced by the savage's experience of dreams and trances. Here, it is claimed, we have the germ of all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, although Tylor confesses that it is impossible to trace the process by which the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> gave rise to the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the great gods. Originally, spirits were the application of human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to non-human beings; they were not <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, but only became so in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Now, as modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> shows the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in ghosts or spirits to be a hallucination, the highest and purest religion--being only the elaboration of savage <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, to the savage mind reasonable enough--cannot be accepted by the modern mind for the reason that it is not <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> nor even <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Such in brief is the outline of the theory by which Tylor attempts to explain not only the phenomenon but the whole history and development of religion.

<p>Tylor's theory expresses two sides of animism, viz., <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and spirits. Spencer attempts to synthesize them into one, viz., <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> or ancestor-worship. He agrees with Tylor in the animistic explanation of dreams, diseases, death, madness, idiocy, i.e. as due to spiritual influences; but differs in presenting one solution only; viz., cult of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> or worship of the dead. "The rudimentary form of all religion", he writes, "is the propitiation of dead ancestors", or "ghost propitiation". Hence Spencer denies that the ascription of life to the whole of nature is a primitive thought, or that men ever ascribed to animals, plants, inanimate objects, and natural phenomena <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of their own. Spencer's theory is known as the "Ghost-theory of Religion" and at the present time is generally discredited even by evolutionists. With Tylor the worship of the dead is an important subdivision of animism; with Spencer it is the one and all of religion. Lippert consistently carries out the theory of Spencer and, instead of animism, uses the word <em>Seelenkult</em>. De la Saussaye says that Lippert pushes his view to an extreme and supports it with rich, but not over-trustworthy, material. Schultze considers <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">fetishism</a> and animism as equally primitive. F.B. Jevons rejects the theory that all gods of earlier races were spirits of dead men deified.

<p>The animism of Tylor is vague and indefinite. It means the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of spirits in general, and is best expressed by "Animated Nature". <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> is a subordinate department of animism, viz, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of spirits embodied in, or attached to, or conveying influence through, certain animals or material objects. The animism of Tylor differs little from the <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> of Reville or the <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">fetishism</a> of De Ia Rialle. It accounts for the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a>. It thus explains the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the passage of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from men to beasts, and to sticks and stones. It includes tree-worship and plant-worship--e.g. the classic hamadrya, the tree-worship of the South African natives, the rice-feasts held by the Dyaks of Borneo to keep the rice-souls in the plants lest by their departure the crop decay. It is the solution proposed for Manes-worship, for the Lares and the Penates among the Greeks and Romans, where the dead ancestors, passing into <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>, go on protecting the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> as the dead chief watches over the tribe. In animism Tylor finds an explanation for funeral rites and customs--feasts of the dead, the human <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, of slaves in Borneo; sending messages to dead chiefs of Dahomey by killing captives taken in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the slaughtering of the Pawnee's horse and of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab's</a> camel at the graves of their masters, placing food and weapons in, or on, the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>--customs which survive in the practice of burning paper messengers and placing stone, clay, or wooden substitutes on graves in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>.

<p>The general principles of animism are: <ol><li> in the last analysis it is a biological theory, and attempts to explain all phenomena through analogy with biological phenomena. To the savage, and to primitive man, all moving things lived, and the fancy which created ghosts or <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to account for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> soon extended this explanation to all other external objects. <li> The greater value it attaches to unwritten sources, viz., folk-lore, customs, rites, tales, and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>, in comparison with literary sources. <li> That spiritual beings are modelled by man on the primary conception of his own human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <li> Their purpose is to explain nature on the primitive, childlike theory that it is thoroughly and throughout animated nature. <li> The conception of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the source and origin of the conceptions of spirit and deity, from the lowest demon up to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and the highest <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">Monotheism</a>. <li> Yet it gives no unified concept of the world, for the spirits which possess, pervade, and crowd nature are individual and independent. <li> It is without <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> thoughts and motives. Thus Tylor holds as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that religion and morality stand on independent grounds; that, while lower races have a code of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, yet their religion--animism--is unmoral, and thus the popular <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the moral government of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is an essential tenet of natural religion simply falls to the ground.</ol> The followers of Tylor have pushed these principles to an extreme and applied them with more clearness and precision. The present tendency of the anthropological <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is to begin with a prereligious stage, from which religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> slowly emerged and elaborated themselves. Hence <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> was preceded by a period characterized by an utter absence of religious conceptions. Thus Tiele holds that animism is not a religion, but a sort of primitive philosophy, which not only controls religion, but rules the whole life of man in the childhood of the world. It is a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that every living thing--i.e. moving thing--is for primitive man animated by a thinking, feeling, willing spirit, differing from the human in degree and power only. Religion did not spring from animism, but its first manifestations are dominated by animism, that being the form of thought natural to primitive man. Pfleiderer teaches that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was formed out of the prehistoric <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in spirits, that these spirits are ancestor-spirits and nature-spirits found everywhere in the primeval period of peoples side by side with one another and passing into each other in various forms of combination without the one being able to be referred to the other, that the prehistoric <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in spirits cannot yet be properly called religion--it only contained the germs of religion. Caspari teaches a pre-animistic period in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> circle and holds that the worship of elders and chieftains was the first religion. Brinton says "the present probability is that in the infancy of the race there was at least no objective expression of religious feeling", and that "there must have been a time in the progress of organic forms from some lower to that highest mammal, man, when he did not have a religious consciousness; for it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> if even the slightest traces of it can be discerned in the inferior animals". The French <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of anthropology is distinguished by its outspoken <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a> and materialism. Darwin, Spencer, and Lubbock hold that primitive man had no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Linguistic analysis, as Baynes clearly proves, shows this to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. The theory of animism has exerted great influence on the study of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> during the last twenty years. This is shown in the animistic trend of Prof. Maspero's study of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> religion; in the contention of the late Prof. W. Robertson Smith that the religion and social institutions of the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semites</a> are founded on <a href="../cathen/14789a.htm">Totemism</a>; in the emphasis laid on the animism of the ancient <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> by Dr. Stade; in the worship of the dead and of ancestors among the <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a> Indians and the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>; in the study of soul-worship among the Greeks, by E. Rhode. That this influence was not for good is the opinion of Prof. Brinton, who says that the acceptance of animism as a sufficient explanation of early cults has led to the neglect, in English-speaking lands, of their profounder analysis and scientific study.

<p>Tylor published the third edition of "Primitive Culture" in 1891, confident of having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the evolution theory as to the origin of our civilization from a savage condition, the savage <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and spirits as the germs of religion, and the continuity of this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in its progressive forms of development up to <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">Monotheism</a>. Yet the hope was short-lived. More scientific research and severer criticism have deprived this theory of its former wide influence.

<p>(1) The assumption that the lowest savages of today give approximately a faithful picture of primitive times is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Savages have a past and a long one, even though not recorded. "Nothing in the natural history of man", writes the Duke of Argyll, "can be more certain than that morally and intellectually and physically he can and often does sink from a higher to a lower level". Max M&uuml;ller assures us that "if there is one thing which a comparative study of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> places in the clearest light, it is the inevitable decay to which every religion is exposed. . . . Whenever we can trace back a religion to its first beginnings, we find it free from many blemishes that affected it in its later states". Even Tylor admits that animism is everywhere found with the worship of a great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Brinton holds that the resemblance of the savage mind to that of the child is superficial and likens the savage to the uncultivated and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> adult among ourselves.

<p>(2) It is opposed by the Philological and Mythological <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Thus Max M&uuml;ller explains much in animism by <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, a poetical conception of nature, and especially by personification. He says that inanimate objects were conceived as active powers and as such were described as agents by a necessity of language, without, however, predicating life or <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of them; for human language knows at first no agents except human agents. Hence animism was a stage of thought reached slowly, and not by sudden impulses. "What is classed as animism in ancient Aryan mythology", he writes, "is often no more than a poetical conception of nature which enables the poet to address sun, moon, rivers and trees as if they could hear and understand his words." The same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> finds abundant illustration in the Psalms. "Sometimes, however," he adds, "what is called animism is a <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> which, after having recognized agents in sun, moon, rivers and trees, postulates on the strength of analogy the existence of agents or spirits dwelling in other parts of nature also, haunting our houses, bringing misfortunes upon us, though sometimes conferring <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>. These ghosts are often mixed up with the ghosts of the departed and form a large chapter in the history of ancient <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>." The ghost, or ancestor, theory received a fatal blow from Lang's "Making of a Religion", where it is shown that the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the most primitive savages is in a High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Supreme God</a>, and Moral <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Lang thus confutes Tylor's contentions: <ul><li>that man could not have possibly started with a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a Supreme Being; <li>that religion and morality must have separate origins.</ul> Even in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, where ancestor-worship prevails, we find it distinct from the worship of gods, and there is no trace of an ancestor having ever become a god. Again, soul-worship and ancestor-worship are not identical, and with many tribes much attention is paid to conciliating the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead where ancestor-worship is unknown. Brinton holds the former to be older and more general. The aim is to get rid of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to put it to rest, or send it on its journey to a better land, lest it trouble the survivors. Karl Mullenh&ouml;ff maintains that folk-lore has no independent value and as a source of mythology is of only secondary importance.

<p>(3) Animism is not the sole and chief source of religion. De la Saussaye says that the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the early Teutons consisted only to a small extent of animistic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and spirits. Prof. F. B. Gummere teaches that in Teutonic mythology animism has not succeeded in annexing nature-mythology. F. B. Jevons holds that the religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is no part of animism pure and simple, and to make the personal agents of animism into <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> agents or divine powers there must be added some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> which is not contained in animism, and that <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is a specifically religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, one which is apprehended directly or <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitively</a> by the religious consciousness. E. Mogk, whose inclinations lean to Tylor, is yet constrained by a scientific mind to recognize nature-worship and the great gods as original; and he warns the student of Teutonic mythology that he must not allow himself to be seduced into disregarding the fact that the worship of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is one of the most original elements of the Teutonic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. De la Saussaye and Pfleiderer hold that the supposition according to which every conception of an object--e.g. tree, sun, moon, clouds, thunder, earth, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>--as a living being has an animistic character is undemonstrable and improbable. They show from Teutonic mythology that the power and beneficent influence of these objects of nature and their symbolic conception belong to another sphere of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and sentiments than that of animism.

<p>(4) Prof. W. Robertson Smith and Prof. Frazer conclusively prove that the animistic religion of fear was neither universal nor primitive. According to Prof. Frazer, the primitive reason of sacrifice was communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Even worship of the dead cannot be entirely explained animistically as the cult of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Animistic conceptions may enter into the worship of ancestors and heroes; but other <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are so essential that they cannot be regarded merely as modifications of soul-worship.

<p>(5) It is not primitive nor specific. Prof. Brinton says, "There is no special form of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> thought which expresses itself as what has been called by Dr. Tylor Animism, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that inanimate objects are animated and possess <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> or spirits." This opinion, which in one guise or another is common to all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> and many <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a>, "is merely a secondary phenomenon of the religious sentiment, not a trait characteristic of primitive faiths". De la Saussaye holds that animism is always and everywhere mixed up with religion; it is nowhere the whole of religion. Cf. ANTHROPOLOGY, MYTHOLOGY, EVOLUTION, <a href="../cathen/14789a.htm">TOTEMISM</a>, <a href="../cathen/13750a.htm">SHAMANISM</a>, <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">FETISHISM</a>, <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">RELIGION</a>, <a href="../cathen/14221a.htm">SPIRITISM</a>.
