<h1>Ann Lobera</h1>  

<p>(Better known as V<font size=-2>ENERABLE</font> A<font size=-2>NN OF</font> J<font size=-2>ESUS</font>).

<p>Carmelite <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, companion of St. Teresa; b. At Medina del Campo (<a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Old Castile</a>), 25 November, 1545; d. at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 4 March, 1621. The daughter of Diego de Lobera of <a href="../cathen/12157a.htm">Plasencia</a>, and of Francisca de Torres of Biscay, Ann was a deaf-mute until her seventh year. Left an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a>, she went to live with her father's relatives. Having made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of virginity while in the world, she took the habit in St. Teresa's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, in 1570. While still a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> St. Teresa called her to Salamanca and placed her over the other <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. Ann made her profession on 22 October, 1571, and accompanied St. Teresa in 1575 to the foundation of Beas, of which she became the first <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a>. Later she was sent by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> to establish her new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>. One of the greatest difficulties consisted in a misunderstanding between St. Teresa and Ann, which drew from the former sharp reprimands, in a letter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 30 May, 1582. With the help of <a href="../cathen/08480a.htm">St. John of the Cross</a>, Ann made a foundation at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> (1586), of which she became <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a>. She also collected St. Teresa's writings for publication. While at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> Ann came into conflict with her superior, Nicholas a Jesu-Maria (Doria), who, by rendering the rules stringent and rigid in the extreme, and by concentrating all authority in the hands of a committee of permanent officials (<em>consulta</em>), sought to guard the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> against any relaxation. It was an open secret that the constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, drawn up by St. Teresa with the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06729d.htm">Jerome Gratian</a>, and approved by a chapter in 1581, were to be brought into line with the new principles of administration. Ann of Jesus, determined to preserve intact St. Teresa's work, appealed (with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Doria) to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for an Apostolic confirmation, which was granted by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 5 June, 1590. But on Doria's complaining that the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> had been acting over the head of their superiors, Philip II twice forbade the meeting of a chapter for the reception of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and their advisers and supporters, Luis de Le&oacute;n and Dominic Ba241;ez, fell into disgrace. Furthermore, for over a year no friar was allowed to hear the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns'</a> confessions. At last Philip having heard the story from the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns'</a> point of view commanded the <em>consulta</em> to resume their government, and petitioned the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for an <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the principles of the constitutions. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 25 April, 1591, revoking the Acts of his predecessor, took a middle course between an unconditional confirmation of the constitutions and an <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the principles of the <em>consulta.</em> These constitutions are still in force in a large number of <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>.

<p>Doria resumed the government of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, but his first act was to punish Ann of Jesus severely for having appealed to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; for three years she was deprived of daily communion, of all intercourse with the other <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and of active and passive voice. At the expiration of this penance she went to Salamanca, where she became <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a> from 1596 to 1599. Meanwhile a movement had been set on foot to introduce the Teresian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Blessed Mary of the Incarnation, warned by St. Teresa and assisted by de Br&eacute;tigny and de <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">B&eacute;rulle</a> brought a few <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, mostly trained by St. Teresa herself, with Ann of Jesus at their heads, from <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a> to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where they established the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Incarnation, 16 October, 1604. Such was the number of <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> that Ann was able to make a further foundation at Pontoise, 15 January, 1605, and a third one on 21 September at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, where she took up her abode; other foundations followed. Nevertheless difficulties arose between her and the superiors in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who were anxious to authorize certain deviations from the strict rule of St. Teresa; the situation had become strained and painful, when Mother Ann was called to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> by the Infanta Isabella and the Archduke Albert, who were anxious to establish a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. She arrived there on 22 January, 1607, and besides the <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> house she made foundations at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (4 November), and Mons (7 February, 1608); and helped to establish those at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Krakow</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. She, moreover, obtained leave from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the Discalced Friars to establish themselves in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> having decided not to spread outside the Peninsula declined the offer, but the Italian congregation sent Thomas &aacute; Jesu with some companions, who arrived at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, on 20 August, 1610. On 18 September, Ann of Jesus and her <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, rendered their obedience to the superior of the Italian congregation. She remained <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a> at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> to the end of her life. Numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> having followed upon her death, the process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> was introduced early in the seventeenth century, and in 1878 she was declared Venerable.
