<h1>Annates</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first fruits</a>, or first year's revenue of an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> paid to the Papal <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> (in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> also). One result of the centralizing of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> during the course of the thirteenth century was that <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> became more and more generally "collated," i.e. granted, directly by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. This was so, not only in the case of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, vacancies which were filled by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> either by direct appointment or by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation, but also in the case of smaller church livings (canonicates, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, etc.). On such occasions the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury received from the new incumbent a certain tax derived from the income of the living. Since the fifteenth century this tax has been generally known as annates, a term comprehending all money taxes paid into the Apostolic Camera (papal treasury) on the occasion of the collation of any <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. Under this term were included four classes of payments: (1) the <em>servitia communia,</em> payable on the granting of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, appointments made in a consistory; these payments were divided between the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury; (2) the <em>servitia minuta,</em> due on like occasions to various subordinate officials of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>; (3) the real <em>annat&aelig;</em> in the narrower sense of the term, which were paid on the granting of a minor <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> by the Pope outside of the consistory; all these payments reverted to the Apostolic Camera; (4) the so-called <em>quindennia,</em> payable every fifteen years by livings permanently united with some other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. Originally, however, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, <em>annat&aelig;</em> or <em>annalia,</em> signified only the third class, the taxes derived from lesser <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. In their origin, therefore, as well as in actual character, annates are distinct from other money tributes received by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury, or Camera, from <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> and institutions&mdash;from the <em>census</em> paid by individual churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in recognition of their direct dependence on the Chair of St. Peter, the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> moneys contributed by an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> on receiving the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, the visitation tributes given by an individual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> on his regular <em>visitatio ad limina</em>. Still more are annates to be distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's Pence</a> accruing to the Papal <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> chiefly from the kingdoms of Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> (England, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, etc.) in token of a certain protection accorded by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and from the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> tribute due from such territories as stood in real <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> relationship to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (e.g. <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>). Among the payments made to the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> in the fifteenth century under the general term of annates, the oldest are the <em>servitia communia</em> and the <em>servitia minuta</em>. At a very early period <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were wont to present gifts to the various <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> concerned. Out of this custom there grew up a prescriptive right to such gifts; in the first half of the thirteenth century a regular scale of payment was prescribed for all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> liable to this tax upon appointment or confirmation of their <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. During the thirteenth century there likewise arose in many <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> and collegiate churches the custom of appropriating for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> officials a year's income from vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. In exceptional cases some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> received from the Pope authority to levy this annate on all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> falling vacant within a specified period. In 1306 <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> reserved for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury a year's revenues from all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> throughout <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> at that time vacant or falling vacant within a period of three years. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, in 1316, made a similar reservation of annates for three years on all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> livings, with a few exceptions. From this time on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the fourteenth century were very frequently forced to adopt these measures to obtain relief in financial straits. Moreover, after the thirteenth century the annate was required from <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> that had been for any reason whatever collated directly by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. This tribute was fixed by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1316-34) at half the annual revenue. At the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (1414-18) and later, many complaints were made concerning these assessments; and in <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> made by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> with separate countries the annates were regulated anew. In particular it was decided that annates on reserved <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> could be paid to the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> only when the annual income exceeded twenty-four gold gulden. With the gradual transformation of the system of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, the annates, strictly so called, disappeared. Today they are levied only on the occasion of new appointments to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> not subject to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, and after the manner fixed by the latest <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> or by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of Circumscription) that legally establish a diocese.
