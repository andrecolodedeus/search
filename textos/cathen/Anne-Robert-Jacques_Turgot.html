<h1>Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot</h1>  

<p>Baron de L'Aulne, French minister, born at Parish, 10 May, 1727; died there, 20 March, 1781. In his youth he was destined for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; he composed a treatise on the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, of which fragments remain, and one on the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is lost. The year 1750, during which he was <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, marks the transition between the two periods of his life: on the one hand, he delivered a discourse on the advantages accruing to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, which showed him as still an ecclesiastic; on the other, he delivered a discourse on the successive progress of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were mingled confusedly. In this discourse he foretold the separation from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> of the North American colonies. Early in 1751 the influence of "philosophy" prevailed over Turgot's mind and he decided not to receive <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. In 1752 he entered the magistracy, was master of <em>r&ecirc;quetes</em> in 1753, spending his leisure time in the acquirement of further <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and in 1761 became intendant at <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>. In the Limousin government Turgot inaugurated certain attempts in conformity with the new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the economists and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>: free trade in corn and the suppression of the taxes known as <em>corv&eacute;es</em>.

<p>When, after a short term in the ministry of marine, he was appointed by Louis XVI (24 Aug., 1774) controller-general of finances, he profited by the office which he held for twenty months to apply in his general policy the principles of <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>. This caused popular discontent, due especially to the rise in the price of corn, but Turgot flattered himself that he could quell all opposition. The edict, by which he substituted for the <em>corv&eacute;e</em> a territorial tax bearing on landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, displeased the privileged classes; that by which he suppressed the <em>ma&icirc;trises</em> and <em>jurandes</em>, an act which the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> regarded as an advance, destroyed the professional organization which in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, under the auspices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, regulated <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> activity and which at present the <a href="../cathen/14385b.htm">syndicalist movement</a> in all countries is endeavouring to re-establish. By depriving the H&ocirc;tel Dieu of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> of its privilege of selling meat on Friday to the exclusion of the butchers, by dispensing the owners of public vehicles from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> they were under of allowing their drivers time on Sunday to hear Mass, and by attempting to change the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which he found too favourable to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Turgot displeased the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who accused him of indifference for the disciplinary <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was disgraced by Louis XVI, 12 May, 1776. In his retirement he wrote for Price, "R&eacute;flexions sur la situation des Am&eacute;ricains des Etats Unis", and for Franklin a treatise, "Des vrais principes de l'imposition". His works were edited by Dussard and Daire (2 vols., Paris, 1844).
