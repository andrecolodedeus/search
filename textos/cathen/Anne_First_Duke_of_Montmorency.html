<h1>Anne, First Duke of Montmorency</h1>  

<p>Born at Chantilly, 15 March, 1492; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 12 November, 1567. He belonged to that <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Montmorency whose members from 1327 held the title of first Barons of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Educated with the future <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, appointed marshal in 1522 as a reward for his services in the capture of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, his successful efforts to obtain the freedom of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at Pavia (1525), assured him of his favour. He immediately became grand master of the royal house and Governor of Languedoc. To his cleverness was due the treaty of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> (1529), by which the two sons of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, retained as hostages by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> since 1526, were released; in 1530 his power became unlimited. He inaugurated a new policy; his foremost aim was that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> should regain her strength and live at peace with the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He arranged the interview at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> (1533) between <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> in which the marriage of Catherine de M&eacute;dicis with Prince Henry, the second son of the king, was arranged. The continued friendship of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> with certain German princes and his ambitions in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> which were opposed to those of the emperor, made an understanding with <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> very difficult. With the outbreak of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in 1536, Montmorency adopted the tactics of never giving battle; he laid waste Provence so that when the imperial forces invaded that province they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by famine to retreat. The articles of agreement which <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> signed (July, 1538), were the work of Montmorency, who declared afterwards that "the interests of both might be considered identical". The journey of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (January, 1540) led <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> to believe that the emperor was about to cede <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> to him; but he was soon undeceived. Montmorency, constable since 1538, was disgraced (June, 1541) through the influence of the favourite, Mme. d'Etampes. In 1547 Henry II, hardly become king, recalled Montmorency and made him really his favourite: <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> made advances to the constable who in 1551 became a duke anda peer. He soon found himself opposed to the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a>. In spite of the military glory of occupying Metz (April, 1552) his one desire was to secure peace between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the Empire, and in 1555 he made a vain effort to bring this about through the mediation of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Mary Tudor</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was prolonged: at Saint-Quentin (August, 1557) Montmorency, defeated, was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>; it was in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> that he commenced the negotiations which terminated in the treaty of Cateau-Cambr&eacute;sis (April, 1559) by which <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> obtained Metz, Toul, <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, and Calais but renounced any claim to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, and Bugey. Montmorency, in retirement during the reign of Francis II, under the regency of Catherine de M&eacute;dicis found his position very complicated. The uncle of Coligny and an enemy of the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a>, it seemed as if he ought to have sustained that policy of toleration towards the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> at first inaugurated by the queen-regent; but his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> convictions led him with the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm#iii">Duke of Guise</a> and the Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal de Saint-Andr&eacute; to form a triumvirate (6 August 1561) to save <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Wounded and captured by the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> at the battle of Dreux (19 December, 1562) after the peace, he joined with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Cond&eacute; in the effort to take Havre from the English (30 July, 1563). In the second <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of religion he again opposed Cond&eacute;; and it was a follower of Cond&eacute; who mortally wounded him at the battle of Saint-Denis (10 November, 1567).

<p>Of indomitable <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, his cruelty towards conquered soldiers was shocking. He preferred defensive to offensive <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a>. Although definitively the first of the great French lords, he worked towards the development of royal absolutism; under <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and Henry II he showed himself a faithful defender of the royal authority and suspected the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a> of being its enemies. A conservative in religion, he could not understand the intrigues of Catherine de M&eacute;dicis and throughout the religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> he fought vigorously for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> under the same banner as the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a> whom he detested. An enlightened and generous protector of the writers and artists of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, in his castle at Chantilly finished in 1530, he gathered together a <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatic</a> collection which later, after the condemnation of the Duke of Montmorency, the descendant of Anne, Louis XIII gave to his brother, Gaston d'Orl&eacute;ans, and which was the beginning of the Cabinet des M&eacute;dailles of the national <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of Chantilly as formed by Anne contained wonderful copies, luxuriously edited, of the first French translations of Latin authors. The Institut de France in 1900 bought Les Heures du conn&eacute;table" to add them again to this <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> from which they had been taken; they form one of the most admirable illuminated <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the sixteenth century, and we find in them a very beautiful <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to Saint Christopher, composed by Anne himself during his years of disgrace; this <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> was completed in 1549. During his disgrace Anne built the chateau of Ecouen where Jean Goujon, Rosso, and Bernard Palissy worked, and where were to be found two slaves in marble of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michael Angelo</a>.
