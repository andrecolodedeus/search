<h1>Anne Garc&iacute;a</h1>  

<p>Better known as Venerable Anne of St. Bartholomew, Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, companion of St. Teresa; b. at Almendral, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Old Castile</a>, 1 Oct. 1550; d. at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 7 June, 1626. She was of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> origin and spent her youth in solitude and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> tending the flocks. When she first went to Avila to enter the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, she was refused, being too young; for several years after, she suffered much at the hands of her brothers. Finally, overcoming all obstacles, she entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> as lay sister and made her <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> on 15 August, 1572. For the next ten years she filled the post of infirmarian; her spirit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> endeared her to St. Teresa, whose almost inseparable companion and secretary she now became. St. Teresa died in her arms at Alba de Tormes in 1582. Anne afterwards returned to <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, took part in the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Ocana (1595), and was one of the seven <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> selected for the introduction of the order into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (October, 1604). The French superiors, desirous of sending her as <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a> to Pontoise, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> her to pass from the state of lay sister to that of choir sister. So unusual a step met with the disapproval of her companions, but as St. Teresa had foretold it many years previously Anne offered no resistance. She had also been forewarned that the same step would cause her great sufferings, and indeed her priorship at Pontoise (January to September, 1605), <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (October, 1605, to April, 1608), Tours May, 1608, to 1611) brought her heavy trials, not the least of which were differences with her superiors. At the expiration of her last term of office she returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but warned by a vision, she proceeded to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (October, 1611), where she founded and became <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> (27 Oct., 1612), which she governed to the end of her life. Twice she was instrumental in delivering the town from the hands of the enemy. In 1735, Anne of St. Bartholomew was declared Venerable; her process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> is not yet completed. Her writings include a number of letters still preserved, an autobiography now at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, edited by <a href="../cathen/02711e.htm">M. Bouix</a> (Paris, 1869-72), and several treatises on spiritual matters, which appeared at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1646.
