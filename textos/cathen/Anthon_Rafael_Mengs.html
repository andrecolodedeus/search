<h1>Anthon Rafael Mengs</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, usually regarded as belonging to the Italian or Spanish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, b. at Aussig in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, 12 March, 1728; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 29 June, 1779. He received his instruction from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Ismael Mengs, who went to Dresden while his son was quite young, and in 1741 moved to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he copied in miniature some works of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> for the Elector of Saxony, which were intended for Dresden. From his youth Mengs was an energetic and skilful artist, and he was appointed a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> to the Elector of Saxony before he was sixteen years old, his skill in crayon portraiture having attracted attention in <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>. He did not, however, feel disposed to accept the position, and declined it with becoming modesty, returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, devoting himself to his studies, and working with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> for four years. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he married Margarita Quazzi, a poor and virtuous peasant girl who had sat for him as a model. At the same time Mengs <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the marriage took place in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church. Shortly afterwards he returned again to Dresden with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, but speedily had a serious difficulty with him, being hurtled with his wife and daughter into the street. The King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, who was then Elector of Saxony, promptly named him a second time as a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> in ordinary to the Royal household, and employed him to decorate the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>. Owing to difficulties in the king's finances, Mengs went again to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1752, and was there employed by the Duke of Northumberland to make copies of several important pictures by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> still in the possession of the present holder of the title, and to be seen at Albury and Alnwick. For many years Mengs supported himself in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by various commissions as all his income from <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a> had been stopped, the emperor Frederick having driven the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> out of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>. It was at this time that Mengs <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a superb fresco on the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Eusebius in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and another very important work in the Villa Albani. He then went on to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and executed various commissions, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> an important <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> for <a href="../cathen/03399a.htm">Caserta</a>, and some portraits, but quickly returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a short time, and was then pressed to enter the service of the Spanish King, Charles III. He arrived at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1761. Here he carried out a very large number of commissions, and was a member, and eventually the director of the Academy of St. Ferdinand. Once more he went back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the sake of his health, and was employed by <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> in the Vatican. He then returned to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1773, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> "the Apotheosis of Trajan" in the royal palace, and several other pictures for Charles III. Again his health broke down, and he finally returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where his wife died. He also died there, and was buried in the church of San Michele, where there is a bronze monument to his memory.

<p>Mengs was a skilful writer, as well as a clever <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, but a man of melancholy dispositions, and of strange, stern habits, too sparing in his diet, and given to over-exertion. He was an affectionate father and husband, but somewhat improvident, and had so little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in his own profession that he refused to allow his children to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> for it. As a copyist he had extraordinary merit, and his original pictures are eclectic in their composition and technique, correct in design, smooth in execution, but somewhat too sweet and a trifle insipid. As a portrait <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, he had great success, and his works in pastel and crayon are amongst his finest creations. There are many of his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a> and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and in the former city are some excellent miniature portraits and some copies in miniature of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>.
