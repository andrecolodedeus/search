<h1>Anthony Blanc</h1>  

<p>Fifth Bishop, and first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, La., <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> b. at Sury, near <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 11 Oct., 1792; d. at <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, 20 June, 1860. He was one of the first <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students after the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 22 July, 1816, by Bishop Dubourg of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, in the Seminary at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, during a visit of that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> in search of help and volunteers for the American mission. He came to America in September, 1817, landing at Annapolis, Md., with several young seminarians, and was entertained until the end of October by Charles Carroll at Carrolton. He then went with Bishop Dubourg to <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> and for nearly fifteen years led the arduous life of a missionary over the wide field of the Mississippi Valley. In 1831, Bishop De Neckere appointed him his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and wanted to make him his coadjutor, but he refused the promotion. When the Bishop died, in 1853, Father Blanc was named administrator, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 22 November, 1835. His <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extended over the States of Louisiana and Mississippi, and in 1838 <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> was added. In 1842 he came into conflict with the lay trustees of the Cathedral over his right to appoint its <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, in the course of which contest he had to <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> the church. Litigation in the courts and appeals to the State Legislature dragged out the controversy for more than a year, but all the issues were decided in favour of the Bishop. In 1838 he established a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and introduced into the diocese the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, the Sisters of charity, the Sisters of Notre Dame, the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, and the Congregations of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and of the Holy Cross. He attended the first <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, and was one of the few American <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> present in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception was proclaimed (8 Dec., 1854). <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> was made an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, 19 July, 1850), and he received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, 16 February, 1851. During his tenure of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> many old abuses were corrected; the number of churches was increased from 26 to 73, of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from 27 to 92, and many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, academics, colleges, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and asylums testified to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and labours. He died suddenly at his residence in new Orl&eacute;ans, discharging with activity to the last the arduous <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office.
