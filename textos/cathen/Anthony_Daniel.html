<h1>Anthony Daniel</h1>  

<p>Huron missionary, born at Dieppe, in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, 27 May 1601, slain by the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> at Teanaostae, near Hillsdale, Limcoe County, <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 4 July, 1648. After two years' study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and one of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1 October, 1621. Sent to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1633 he was first stationed at Cape Breton, where his brother Captain Daniel had established a French fort in 1629. For two years he had charge at Quebec of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for Indian boys, but with this exception he was connected with the Mission at Ihonatiria, in the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> country, from July, 1634, until his death fourteen years later. In the summer of 1648, the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> made a sudden attack on the mission while most of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> braves were absent. Father Daniel did all in his power to aid his people. Before the palisades had been scaled he hurried to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> where the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, children, and old men were gathered gave them general <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. Daniel himself made no attempt to escape, but calmly advanced to meet the enemy. Seized with amazement the savages halted for a moment, then recovering themselves they discharged at him a shower of arrows. "The victim to the heroism of charity", says Bancroft, "died, the <a href="../cathen/08374x.htm">name of Jesus</a> on his lips, the wilderness gave him a grave; the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> nation were his mourners" (vol. II, ch. xxxii). Here Bancroft is in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. The lifeless body was flung into the burning <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and both were consumed together. Daniel was the second to receive the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown among the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>, and the first of the missionaries to the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>. <a href="../cathen/12633b.htm">Father Ragueneau</a>, his superior, speaks of him in a letter to the general of the order as "a truly remarkable man, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, united with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of never failing patience and indomitable <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in adversity" (Thwaites, tr. Relations, XXXIII, 253-269).
