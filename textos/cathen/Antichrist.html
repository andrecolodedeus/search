<h1>Antichrist</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>Antichristos</em>).

<p>In composition <em>anti</em> has different meanings: <em>antibasileus</em> denotes a king who fills an interregnum; <em>antistrategos</em>, a propraetor; <em>anthoupatos</em>, a proconsul; in Homer <em>antitheos</em> denotes one resembling a god in power and beauty, while in other works it stands for a hostile god. Following mere analogy one might interpret <em>antichristos</em> as denoting one resembling <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in appearance and power; but it is safer to define the word according to its biblical and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> usage.
<h2 id="section1">Biblical meaning of the word</h2>

<p>The word <em>Antichrist</em> occurs only in the <a href="../cathen/08435a.htm">Johannine Epistles</a>; but there are so-called real <a href="../cathen/11473a.htm">parallelisms</a> to these occurrences in the <a href="../cathen/01594b.htm">Apocalypse</a>, in the Pauline Epistles, and less explicit ones in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Book of Daniel</a>.
<h3 id="A">In the Johannine epistles</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a> supposes in his Epistles that the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are acquainted with the teaching concerning the coming of Antichrist. "You have heard that Antichrist cometh" (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs18">1 John 2:18</a>); "This is Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he cometh" (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs3">1 John 4:3</a>). Though the Apostle speaks of several Antichrists, he distinguishes between the many and the one principal agent: "Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists" (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs18">1 John 2:18</a>). Again, the writer outlines the character and work of Antichrist: "They went out from us, but they were not of us" (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs19">1 John 2:19</a>); "Who is a liar, but he who denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>? This is Antichrist, who denies the Father, and the Son" (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs22">1 John 2:22</a>); "And every spirit that dissolveth <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this is Antichrist" (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs3">1 John 4:3</a>); "For many seducers are gone out into the world, who confess not that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is come in the flesh: this is a seducer and an Antichrist" (<a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#vrs7">2 John 7</a>). Also the time, the Apostle places the coming of Antichrist at "the last hour" (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs18">1 John 2:18</a>); again he maintains that "he is now already in the world" (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs3">1 John 4:3</a>).
<h3 id="B">In the Apocalypse</h3>

<p>Nearly all commentators find Antichrist mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/01594b.htm">Apocalypse</a>, but they do not agree as to the particular chapter of the Book in which the mention occurs. Some point to the "beast" of <a href="../bible/rev011.htm">11:7</a>, others to the "red dragon" of <a href="../bible/rev012.htm">Chapter 12</a>, others again to the beast "having seven heads and ten horns" of <a href="../bible/rev013.htm">13, sqq.</a>, while many scholars identify Antichrist with the beast which had "two horns, like a lamb" and spoke "as a dragon" (<a href="../bible/rev013.htm">13:11, sqq.</a>), or with the scarlet-coloured beast "having seven heads and ten horns" (<a href="../bible/rev017.htm">17</a>), or, finally, with <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> "loosed out of his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>," and seducing the nations (<a href="../bible/rev020.htm">20:7, sqq.</a>). A detailed discussion of the reasons for and against each of these opinions would be out of place here.
<h3 id="C">In the Pauline epistles</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a> supposes that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the coming of Antichrist is already known to his readers; many commentators believe that it had become known in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through the writings of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. St. John urged against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of his time that those who denied the mystery of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> were faint images of the future great Antichrist. The latter is described more fully in <a href="../bible/2th002.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3, sqq., 7-10</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> disturbances had occurred on account of the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the second coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was imminent. This impression was owing partly to a misunderstanding of <a href="../bible/1th004.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15, sqq.</a>, partly to the machinations of deceivers. It was with a view of remedying these disorders that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> wrote his Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, inserting especially <a href="../bible/2th003.htm">2:3-10</a>. The Pauline <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is this: "the day of the Lord" will be preceded by "a revolt", and the revelation of the "man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." The latter will sit in the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, showing himself as if he were <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; he will work signs and lying wonders by the power of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; he will seduce those who received not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that they might be saved; but the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> shall kill him with the spirit of His mouth, and destroy him with the brightness of His coming. As to the time, "the mystery of iniquity already worketh; only that he who now holdeth, do hold, until he be taken out of the way." Briefly, the "day of the Lord" will be preceded by the "man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" known in the Johannine Epistles as Antichrist; the "man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" is preceded by "a revolt," or a great <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>; this <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> is the outcome of the "mystery of iniquity" which already "worketh", and which, according to <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a>, shows itself here and there by faint types of Antichrist. The Apostle gives three stages in the evolution of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: the leaven of iniquity, the great <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, and the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But he adds a clause calculated to determine the time of the main event more accurately; he describes something first as a thing (<em>to datechon</em>), then as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (<em>ho katechon</em>), preventing the occurrence of the main event: "Only he who now holdeth, do hold, until he be taken out of the way." We can here only enumerate the principal opinions as to the meaning of this clause without discussing their value:



<ul> <li>The impediment of the main event is "the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"; the main event is the second coming of the Lord (Grimm, Simar). <li>The impediment is the Roman Empire; the main event impeded is the "man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (most <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and later interpreters) <li>The Apostle referred to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and events of his own time; the <em>katechon</em> and the "man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" are variously identified with the Emperors Caligula, Titus, <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, Claudius, etc. (<a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> living after the seventeenth century). <li>The Apostle refers immediately to contemporary men and events, which are, however, types of the <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatological</a> <em>katechon</em>, "man of sin", and day of the Lord; the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, e.g., is the type of the Lord's second coming, etc. (<a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>). </ul>

<p>Before leaving the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Pauline</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Antichrist, we may ask ourselves, whence did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> derive his teaching? Here again we meet with various answers.

<ul> <li><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> expresses merely his own view based on the Jewish tradition and the imagery of the Prophets <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> and <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Ezekiel</a>. This view has been advocated by several <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers. <li>The Apostle expresses the impression produced on the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatological</a> teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. This opinion is expressed by <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>. <li><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> derived his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning Antichrist from the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the prophecy of Daniel, and the contemporary events. This opinion, too, is expressed by <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>. <li>The Apostle uttered a prophecy received through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interpreters have generally adhered to this opinion. </ul>
<h3 id="D">In the evangelists and Daniel</h3>

<p>After studying the picture of Antichrist in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> Epistle to the Thessalonians, one easily recognizes the "man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" in Daniel 7:8, 11, 20, 21, where the Prophet describes the "little horn." A type of Antichrist is found in Daniel 8:8 sqq., 23, sqq., 11:21-45, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Antiochus Epiphanes. Many commentators have found more or less clear allusions to Antichrist in the coming of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Christs and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs24">Matthew 24:24</a>; <a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs6">Mark 13:6, 22</a>; <a href="../bible/luk021.htm#vrs8">Luke 21:8</a>), in the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">"abomination of desolation"</a>, and in the one that "shall come in his own name" (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs43">John 5:43</a>).
<h2 id="section2">Antichrist in ecclesiastical language</h2>

<p>Bousset believes that there was among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a fully developed legend of Antichrist, which was accepted and amplified by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; and that this legend diverges from and contradicts in important points the conceptions found in the Apocalypse. We do not believe that Bousset has fully <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his opinion; his view as to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> development of the concept of Antichrist does not exceed the merits of an ingenious theory. We need not here enter upon an investigation of Gunkel's work, in which he traces back the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of Antichrist to the primeval dragon of &OElig;the deep; this view deserves no more attention than the rest of the author's mythological fancies.

<p>What then is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> concept of Antichrist? Francisco Su&aacute;rez maintains that it is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that Antichrist is an individual <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, a signal enemy of Christ. This excludes the contention of those who explain Antichrist either as the whole collection of those who oppose <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, or as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Papacy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensian</a> and <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> and <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a>, called the Pope by the name of Antichrist; but the expression was only a metaphor in their case. It was only after the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> that the name was applied to the Pope in its proper sense. It then passed practically into the creed of the <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Lutherans</a>, and has been seriously defended by them as late as 1861 in the "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r lutherische Theologie". The change from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church into the reign of Antichrist is said to have taken place between 19 February and 10 November, A.D. 607, when <a href="../cathen/02660b.htm">Pope Boniface III</a> obtained from the Greek emperor Newton, the title "Head of All the Churches" for the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. An appeal was made to Apocalypse 13:8, in confirmation of this date, and it was calculated from Apocalypse 11:3, that the end of the world might be expected in A.D. 1866. <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Cardinal Bellarmine</a> refuted this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> both from an <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> and historical point of view in "De Rom. Pont.", III.

<p>The individual <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Antichrist will not be a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, as some of the ancient writers believed; nor will he be the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> incarnated in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Antichrist. He will he a human <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, perhaps of Jewish extraction, if the explanation of Genesis 49:17, together with that of <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan's</a> omission in the catalogue of the tribes, as found in the Apocalypse, be correct. It must be kept in mind that extra-Scriptural tradition furnishes us no revealed supplement to the Biblical data concerning Antichrist. While these latter are sufficient to make the believer recognize the "man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" at the time of his coming, the lack of any additional reliable revelation should put us on our guard against the daydreams of the <a href="../cathen/08174a.htm">Irvingites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormons</a>, and other recent proclaimers of new revelations.

<p>It may not be out of place to draw the reader's attention to two dissertations by the late <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> on the subject of Antichrist. The one is entitled "The Patristic Idea of Antichrist"; it considers successively his time, religion, city, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. It formed the eighty-third number of the "Tracts for the Times." The other dissertation bears the title "The Protestant Idea of Antichrist."

<p>In order to understand the significance of the <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal's</a> essays on the question of the Antichrist, it must be kept in mind that a variety of opinions sprang up in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> concerning the nature of this opponent of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.

<ul> <li>Koppe, Nitzsch, Storr, and Pelt contended that the Antichrist is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle, not embodied either in a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or a polity; this opinion is in opposition to both <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and St. John. Both Apostles describe the adversary as being distinctly concrete in form. <li>A second view admits that the Antichrist is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but it maintains that he is a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the past; <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>, Caligula, Titus, <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, Simon the son of Giora, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a> Ananias, Vitellius, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and the Jewish zealots have been variously identified with the Antichrist. But there is little traditional authority for this opinion; besides, it does not appear to satisfy fully the prophetic predictions, and, in the case of some of its adherents, it is based on the supposition that the inspired writers could not transcend the limits of their experiences. <li>A third opinion admitted that the Antichrist must indeed appear in a concrete form, but it identified this concrete form with the system of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">the Papacy</a>. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a>, Beza, Calixtus, Bengel, Michaelis, and almost all the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers of the Continent are cited as upholding this view; the same may be said of the English <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, Hooper, Hutchinson, Tyndale, Sandys, Philpot, Jewell, Rogers, Fulke, Bradford, King James, and Andrewes. Bramhall introduced qualifications into the theory, and after this its ascendancy began to wane among English writers. Nor must it be supposed that the Papal-Antichrist theory was upheld by all <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in the same form; the False Prophet or second Apocalyptic Beast is identified with Antichrist and the Papacy by Aretius, Foxe, Napier Mede, Jurieu, Cunninghame, Faber, Woodhouse, and Habershon; the first Apocalyptic Beast holds this position in the opinion of Marlorat, King James, Daubuz, and Galloway; both Beasts are thus identified by Brightman, Pareus, Vitringa, Gill, Bachmair, Fraser, Croly, Fysh, and Elliott. </ul>

<p>After this general survey of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> views concerning the Antichrist, we shall be able to appreciate some of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman's</a> critical remarks on the question.

<ul> <li>If any part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be proved to be antichristian, all of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is so, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> branch inclusive. <li>The Papal-Antichrist theory was gradually developed by three historical bodies: the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, and the Fraticelli, between the eleventh and the sixteenth centuries: are these the expositors from whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Christ is to receive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> interpretation of the prophecies? <li>The defenders of the Papal-Antichrist theory have made several signal blunders in their arguments; they cite <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> as identifying the Beast of the Apocalypse with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, though St. Bernard speaks in the passage of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">Antipope</a>; they appeal to the Abbot Joachim as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that Antichrist will be elevated to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, while the Abbot really believes that Antichrist will overthrow the Pope and usurp his See; finally, they appeal to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a> as asserting that whoever claims to be Universal Bishop is Antichrist, whereas the great Doctor really speaks of the Forerunner of Antichrist who was, in the language of his day, nothing but a token of an impending great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <li><a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were driven to the Papal-Antichrist theory by the necessity of opposing a popular answer to the popular and cogent arguments advanced by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for her Divine authority. <li>Warburton, Newton, and Hurd, the advocates of the Papal-Antichrist theory, cannot be matched against the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <li>If the Pope be Antichrist, those who receive and follow him cannot be men like <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, or <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, or <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>. <li>If the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must suffer like Christ, and if Christ was called <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church must expect a similar reproach; thus, the Papal-Antichrist theory becomes an argument in favor of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. <li>The gibe, "If the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> is not Antichrist, he has bad luck to be so like him", is really another argument in favour of the claims of the Pope; since Antichrist simulates Christ, and the Pope is an image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Antichrist must have some similarity to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, if the latter be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Vicar of Christ. </ul>
