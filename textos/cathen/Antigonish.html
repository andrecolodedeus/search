<h1>Antigonish</h1>  

<p>(Micmac, <em>nalagitkooneech</em>, "where the branches are torn off")

<p>Antigonish is the shiretown of the county of the same name in <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>. On the 23d of August, 1886, it was made the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of one of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> constituting the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a>. The first see was Arichat. The diocese takes in the three easternmost counties of <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a> proper, with the whole island of Cape Breton. Up to 1817, Nova Scotia formed a part of the Diocese of Quebec; in that year it was erected into a vicariate, and the Right Rev. Edmund Burke appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. He was succeeded, in 1827, by the Right Rev. William Fraser. On the 21st of September, 1844, the vicariate was divided, and two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were formed, the sees being Halifax and Arichat. Bishop Fraser was appointed to the latter see. An alumnus of the Scottish College at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, he was a strong man, physically and mentally fitted to play the part of pioneer missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He died 4 October, 1851, and was succeeded, 27 February, 1852, by the Right Rev. Colin Francis MacKinnon, D.D., a graduate of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> He was a man of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>, and of singularly amiable character. Failing health led him to resign, 19 January, 1877, when his coadjutor, the Right Rev. John Cameron, D.D., also a graduate of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 22 May, 1870, became administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. On his resigning this charge, Bishop MacKinnon was made titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429c.htm">Amida</a>. He died two years later, 26 September, 1879.

<p>Within the Diocese of Antigonish is the historic town of Louisbourg. As far back as 1604 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were in <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, then known as Acadie, or Acadia. Between that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> and the taking of Louisbourg by the English in 1758, the indefatigable missionaries of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> busied themselves with the evangelization of the native <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmacs</a>. The fact that the whole tribe still hold fast the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> preached to them, despite the efforts made from time to time to rob them of it and the paucity of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> labourers in the fifty years that followed the fall of Louisbourg, attests the thoroughness with which the early Recollet and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Fathers did their work. Till the closing years of the eighteenth century, some hundreds of the aborigines, together with a remnant of the first French settlers, known as Acadians, and a few <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, made up the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of what is now the Diocese of Antigonish. In 1791, the first party of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigrants from the Scottish Highlands reached Pictou in two ships. Driven from their native braes and glens by the rapacity of the landlords, who turned their ancestral holdings into sheepwalks, they found new homes and free holdings in the wild woods of <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>. From this time forward the tide of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> immigration gathered strength, until it reached its highest point in 1817. In July, 1802, about 1,500 Highland Scottish <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were settled along the shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. For the greater part of the time they were without a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, save for the occasional visits of the Rev. Angus Bernard MacEachern afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03632a.htm">Charlottetown</a>, P. E. I., who braved the perils of the sea in an open boat to bring them the consolations of religion. In the same year two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> came out from <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and these in time were followed by others. They shared with their people the hardships incident to pioneer life in "the forest primeval." Among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who laboured during the first two decades of the nineteenth century in the territory now comprised in the Diocese of Antigonish were Abb&eacute; Lejamtel, among the Acadians; the Reverends Alexander MacDonnel, William Chisholm, and Colin Grant, in the Scottish settlements on the mainland; the Reverend James Grant, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in Antigonish; the Reverend Alexander MacDonnell in the Scottish settlements in Cape Breton, and Father Vincent, founder of the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> Monastery at Tracadie, among the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmacs</a> and Acadians. The last-named, known in the Gaelic-speaking communities as <em>A Sagart Ban</em>, or White Priest, from the flowing white robe of his <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Order</a>, which he wore also on his missionary journeys, was a man of singularly holy life. The first session of the court, appointed in 1905 to inquire into his title to sainthood, was held in June, 1906.

<p><a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> College, established at Antigonish in 1855, and endowed with <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> powers in 1866, is the chief seat of learning. Mt. St. Bernard, an academy for young ladies, conducted by the Sisters of Notre Dame, is affiliated to <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a>. The Sisters of Notre Dame have eight other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> within the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; the Sisters of Charity, six; the <a href="../cathen/08374a.htm">Daughters of Jesus</a>, lately come from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, four; the Sisters of St. Martha, one. The <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, at Petit Clairvaux, Tracadie, are the only <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order of men. In 1871, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was 62,853; in 1891, it was 73,500, of whom about 42,000 were Highland Scotch, 19,000 French, 11,000 <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and 1,500 <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmacs</a>. The present population is in the neighbourhood of 80,000. There are 101 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, including 11 <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, 67 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, and 34 missions with churches.
