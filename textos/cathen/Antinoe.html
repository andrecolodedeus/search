<h1>Antinoe</h1>  

<p>(or ANTINOPOLIS)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>, now Esneh or Esench, a city in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, built by the <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a> <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 132, in memory of his favourite, Antinous. Situated in the very centre of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the city attracted more than ordinary attention, not only by its splendour, but by its originality, being constructed, as it was, on the plan of Roman and Greek cities, without any trace of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> architecture. The topography of its ruins is yearly growing less distinct, since an <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> industry set up in the neighbourhood draws on its antique materials as it might on some deserted marble quarry. After the fashion of Greek and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> cities, the city was intersected by streets along the sides of which ran porticoes and <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnades</a>, and several of the streets were arched over.

<p>Antinoe played but a small part in the history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It became the seat of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a>, and a good many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded in the neighbourhood. Thanks to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> climate, the <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">cemeteries</a> opened in recent years have supplied the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity with many noteworthy objects. Roman and Byzantine burial-places have been found in a wonderful state of preservation. The bodies, before burial, underwent a preparation very different from that in use with the ancient Egyptians, and were carefully dressed; clothes, stuffing, and a mask being used instead of mummification, which was no longer practised. The bodies, however, had the appearance of mummies. To this manner of preparing their dead we owe the preservation of various personal effects as well as of stuffs. The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> named Euphemi&acirc;an (?) contained an <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> case in the folds of her dress, and shoes of red leather enriched with gold tracery. The excavations carried on by M. A. Gayet have brought to light objects which are now in the Mus&eacute;e Guimet at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">prayer-chaplets</a>, baskets, phials, boxes of wood and <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, etc. Papyri have also been found at Antinoe, one of the most interesting being the will of Aurelius Colluthus.

<p>Several ruins of some importance are to be seen in the neighbourhood of Antinoe. One of the most noteworthy is that of De&iuml;r Abou-Hennys, where there is an underground church, ornamented with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of real interest, less on account of the choice of subjects than for the skill and taste which they show in a Coptic <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">artist</a> of the seventh or eighth century. They represent scenes from the Gospel, with a few drawn from the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> books, and are interspersed with a great number of <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscriptions</a>, most of which are mutilated or undecipherable.
