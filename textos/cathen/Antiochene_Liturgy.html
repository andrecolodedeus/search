<h1>Antiochene Liturgy</h1>  

<p>The family of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> originally used in the Patriarchate of Antioch begins with that of the Apostolic Constitutions; then follow that of St. James in Greek, the Syrian Liturgy of St. James, and the other Syrian <em>Anaphorus</em>. The line may be further continued to the Byzantine Rite (the older Liturgy of St. Basil and the later and shorter one of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>), and through it to the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> use. But these no longer concern the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>.
<h2 id="section1">The liturgy of the Apostolic Constitutions</h2>

<p>The oldest known form that can be described as a complete liturgy is that of the Apostolic Constitutions. It is also the first member of the line of Antiochene uses. The <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitutions</a> consist of eight books purporting to have been written by <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a> (died c. 104). The first six books are an interpolated edition of the <em>Didascalia</em> ("Teaching of the Apostles and Disciples", written in the first half of the third century and since edited in a Syriac version by de Lagarde, 1854); the seventh book is an equally modified version of the <em><a href="../fathers/0714.htm">Didache</a></em> (Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, probably written in the first century, and found by Philotheos Bryennios in 1883) with a collection of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The eighth book contains a complete liturgy and the eighty-five "Apostolic Canons". There is also part of a liturgy modified from the Didascalia in the second book. It has been suggested that the compiler of the Apostolic Constitutions may be the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as the author of the six spurious letters of St. Ignatius (Pseudo-Ignatius). In any case he was a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, probably an Apollinarist, living in or near Antioch either at the end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century. And the liturgy that he describes in his eighth book is that used in his time by the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>, with certain modifications of his own. That the writer was an Antiochene Syrian and that he describes the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use of his own country is shown by various details, such as the precedence given to Antioch (VII, xlvi, VIII, x, etc.); his mention of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> (VIII, xxxiii), which was kept at Antioch since about 375, nowhere else in the East till about 430 (Duchesne, Origines du culte chr&eacute;tien, 248); the fact that <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> together make up seven weeks (V, xiii) as at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, whereas in Palestine and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, as throughout the West, <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> was the sixth week of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>; that the chief source of his "Apostolic Canons" is the Synod of Antioch <em>in enc&aelig;niis</em> (341); and especially by the fact that his liturgy is obviously built up on the same lines as all the Syrian ones. There are, however, modifications of his own in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, Creed, and Gloria, where the style and the idioms are obviously those of the interpolator of the Didascalia (see the examples in Brightman, "Liturgies", I, xxxiii-xxxiv), and are often very like those of Pseudo-Ignatius also (ib., xxxv). The <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> are added by the compiler, apparently from his own observations.

<p>The liturgy of the eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions, then, represents the use of Antioch in the fourth century. Its order is this: First comes the "Mass of the Catechumens". After the readings (of the Law, the Prophets, the Epistles, Acts, and Gospels) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> greets the people with <a href="../bible/2co013.htm#vrs13">2 Corinthians 13:13</a> (The grace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> and the charity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all). They answer: "And with thy spirit"; and he "speaks to the people words of comfort." There then follows a <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, to each invocation of which the people answer "Kyrie eleison"; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> says a collect and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> dismisses the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. Similar <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> and collects follow for the Energumens, the Illuminandi (<em>photiz&oacute;menoi</em>, people about to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>) and the public penitents, and each time they are dismissed after the collect for them. The "Mass of the Faithful" begins with a longer <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> for various causes, for peace, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (James, Clement, Evodius, and Annianus are named), <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, servers, readers, singers, virgins, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, married people, the newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, enemies, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>, etc., and finally "for every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>". After the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> follows its collect, then another greeting from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>. Before the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> stand at the men's doors and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> at those of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> "that no one may go out, nor the door be opened", and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> again warns all <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to retire, the mothers to look after their children, no one to stay in <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>, and all to stand in fear and trembling. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> bring the offerings to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the altar. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> stand around, two <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> wave fans (<em>&lsquo;rip&#237;dia</em>) over the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> and the <em><a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a></em> (canon) begins. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> again greets the people with the words of <a href="../bible/2co013.htm#vrs13">2 Corinthians 13:13</a>, and they answer as before: "And with thy spirit". He says: "Lift up your mind." <em>R.</em> "We have it to the Lord." <em>V.</em> "Let us thank the Lord." <em>R.</em> "Right and just." He takes up their word: "It is truly right and above all just to sing to Thee, Who art truly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, existing before all creatures, from Whom all fatherhood in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and on earth is named.&hellip;" and so the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic prayer</a> begins. He speaks of the "only begotten Son, the Word and God, Saving Wisdom, first born of all creatures, Angel of thy great counsel", refers at some length to the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Garden of Eden</a>, Abel, Henoch, Abraham, <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, Job, and other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>. When he has said the words: "the numberless army of Angels &hellip; the Cherubim and six-winged Seraphim &hellip; together with thousands of thousand Archangels and myriad myriads of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a> unceasingly and without silence cry out", "all the people together say: 'Holy, holy, holy the Lord of Hosts, the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth are full of His glory, blessed forever, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.'" The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then again takes up the word and continues: "Thou art truly holy and all-holy, highest and most exalted for ever. And thine only-begotten Son, our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, is holy &hellip;"; and so he comes to the words of Institution: "in the night in which He was betrayed, taking bread in His holy and blameless hands and looking up to Thee, His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Father, and breaking He gave to His disciples saying: This is the Mystery of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; take of it, eat. This is My body, broken for many for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. So also having mixed the cup of wine and water, and having blessed it, He gave to them saying: Drink you all of this. This is My blood shed for many for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Do this in memory of Me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you announce My death until I come."



<p>Then follow the <em>Anamimnesis</em> ("Remembering therefore His suffering and death and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> and <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">return to heaven</a> and His future second coming &hellip;"), the <em><a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a></em> or invocation ("sending Thy Holy Spirit, the witness of the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> to this sacrifice, that He may change this bread to the body of thy Christ and this cup to the blood of thy Christ &hellip;"), and a sort of <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> (the great Intercession) for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the Emperor, and for all sorts and conditions of men, which ends with a <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a>, "and all the people say: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." In this <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> is a curious petition (after that for the Emperor and the army) which joins the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to living people for whom the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>: "We also offer to thee for (<em>&lsquo;up&eacute;r</em>) all thy holy and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> well-pleasing <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, just apostles, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, confessors, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, readers, singers, virgins, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and all those whose names thou knowest." After the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">Kiss</a> of Peace (The peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be with you all) the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> calls upon the people to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for various causes which are nearly the same as those of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gathers up their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in a collect. He then shows them the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, saying: "Holy things for the holy" and they answer: "One is holy, one is Lord, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>, etc." The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives the people <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> in the form of bread, saying to each: "The body of Christ", and the communicant "answers <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>". The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> follows with the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, saying: "The blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of life." <em>R.</em> "Amen." While they receive, the xxxiii Psalm (I will <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the Lord at all times) is said. After Communion the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> take what is left of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> to the tabernacles (<em>pastoph&oacute;ria</em>). There follows a short thanksgiving, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> dismisses the people and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> ends by saying: "Go in peace."

<p>Throughout this liturgy the compiler supposes that it was drawn up by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and he inserts sentences telling us which Apostle composed each separate part, for instance: "And I, James, brother of John the son of Zebedee, say that the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> shall say at once: 'No one of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>,'" etc. The second book of the Apostolic Constitutions contains the outline of a liturgy (hardly more than the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>) which practically coincides with this one. All the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> of the Antiochene class follow the same general arrangement as that of the Apostolic Constitutions. Gradually the preparation of the oblation (<em>Prothesis,</em> the word also used for the credence table), before the actual liturgy begins, develops into an elaborate service. The preparation for the lessons (the little Entrance) and the carrying of the oblation from the <em>Prothesis</em> to the altar (the great Entrance) become solemn processions, but the outline of the liturgy: the Mass of the Catechumens and their dismissal; the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>; the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> beginning with the words "Right and just" and interrupted by the Sanctus; the words of Institution; Anamimnesis, <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> and Supplication for all kinds of people at that place; the <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a> with the words "Holy things to the holy"; the Communion distributed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> (the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> having the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>); and then the final <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and dismissal&mdash;this order is characteristic of all the Syrian and Palestinian uses, and is followed in the derived Byzantine <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. Two points in that of the Apostolic Constitutions should be noticed. No <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are mentioned by name and there is no Our Father. The mention of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> names, especially of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">"All-holy Mother of God"</a>, spread considerably among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> after the Council of Ephesus (431), and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> invoking her under that title were then added to all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. The Apostolic Constitutions have preserved an older form unchanged by the development that modifies forms in actual use. The omission of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> is curious and unique. It has at any rate nothing to do with relative antiquity. In the "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" (VIII, ii, 3) people are told to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> three times a day "as the Lord commanded in his Gospel: <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a>", etc.
<h2 id="section2">The Greek Liturgy of St. James</h2>

<p>Of the Antiochene <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> drawn up for actual use, the oldest one and the original from which the others have been derived is the Greek Liturgy of St. James. The earliest reference to it is Canon xxxii of the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Quinisextum Council</a> (II Trullan <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 692), which quotes it as being really composed by St. James, the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of Our Lord</a>. The Council appeals to this liturgy in defending the mixed <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (died 420) seems to have known it. At any rate at Bethlehem he quotes as a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> form the words "who alone is sinless", which occur in this Liturgy (Adv. Pel., II, xxiii). The fact that the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> use the same liturgy in Syriac shows that it existed and was well established before the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. The oldest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is one of the tenth century formerly belonging to the Greek <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a> and now kept in the University <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of that city. The Greek Liturgy of St. James follows in all its essential parts that of the Apostolic Constitutions. It has preparatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be said by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and a blessing of the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. Then begins the Mass of the Catechumens with the little Entrance. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> says a <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> (<em>&rsquo;ekt&eacute;neia</em>), to each clause of which the people answer "Kyrie eleison". Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is saying a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to himself, of which only the last words are said aloud, after the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> is finished. The singers say the Trisagion, "Holy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, holy Strong One, holy Immortal One, have mercy on us." The practice of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> saying one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> silently while the people are occupied with something different is a later development. The Lessons follow, still in the older form, that is, long portions of both Testaments, then the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and their dismissal. Among the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> occurs a reference to the cross (lift up the horn of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by the power of the venerable and life-giving cross) which must have been written after St. Helen found it (c. 326) and which is one of the many reasons for connecting this liturgy with <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> are dismissed the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> tells the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to "know each other", that is to observe whether any stranger is still present. The great Entrance which begins the Mass of the Faithful is already an imposing <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> is blessed, the oblation is brought from the <em>Prothesis</em> to the altar while the people sing the Cherubikon, ending with three <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluias</a>. (The text is different from the Byzantine Cherubikon.) Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> says another <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> silently. The creed is then said; apparently at first it was a shorter form like the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> are much longer than those in the Apostolic Constitutions. There is as yet no reference to an <em>Iconostasis</em> (screen dividing the choir or place of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>). The beginning of the "Anaphora" (Preface) is shorter. The words of Institution and Anamimnesis are followed immediately by the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>; then comes the Supplication for various people. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> reads the "Diptychs" of the names of the people for whom they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; then follows a list of Saints beginning with "our all-holy, immaculate and highly praised <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Lady Mary</a>, Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and ever-virgin." Here are inserted two <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> obviously directed against the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> follows with an introduction and <em>Embolismos</em>. The Host is shown to the people with the same words as in the Apostolic Constitutions, and then broken, and part of it is put into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> says: "The mixing of the all-holy Body and the precious Blood of Our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>." Before Communion Psalm xxxiii is said. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> says a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before his Communion. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> communicates the people. There is no such form as: "The Body of Christ"; he says only: "Approach in the fear of the Lord", and they answer "Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord." What is left of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is taken by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to the Prothesis; the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of thanksgiving are longer than those of the Apostolic Constitutions. The Liturgy of St. James as it now exists is a more developed form of the same use as that of the Apostolic Constitutions. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are longer, the ceremonies have become more elaborate, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> is used continually, and the preparation is already on the way to become the complicated service of the Byzantine Prothesis. There are continual invocations of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; but the essential outline of the Rite is the same. Besides the references to the Holy Cross, one allusion makes it clear that it was originally drawn up for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The first supplication after the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> is: "We offer to thee, O Lord, for Thy holy places which Thou hast glorified by the divine appearance of Thy Christ and by the coming of Thy holy Spirit, especially for the holy and illustrious Sion, mother of all churches and for Thy <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and apostolic Church throughout the world." This liturgy was used throughout <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine, that is throughout the Antiochene Patriarchate (Jerusalem was not made a patriarchal see till the Council of Ephesus, 431) before the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>. It is possible to reconstruct a great part of the use of the city of Antioch while <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> was preaching there (370-397) from the allusions and quotations in his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> (Probst, Liturgie des IV. Jahrh., II, i, v, 156, 198). It is then seen to be practically that of St. James: indeed whole passages are quoted word for word as they stand in St. James or in the Apostolic Constitutions.

<p>The Catechisms of <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> were held in 348; the first eighteen are addressed to the <em>Competentes (photiz&oacute;menoi)</em> during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, the last six to the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> in <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> week. In these he explains, besides Baptism and Confirmation, the holy liturgy. The allusions to the liturgy are carefully veiled in the earlier ones because of the <em><a href="../cathen/05032a.htm">disciplina arcani</a></em>; they became much plainer when he speaks to people just <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, although even then he avoids quoting the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> form or the words of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. From these Catechisms we learn the order of the <a href="../cathen/08371a.htm">liturgy at Jerusalem</a> in the middle of the fourth century. Except for one or two unimportant variations, it is that of St. James (Probst, op. cit., II, i, ii, 77-106). This liturgy appears to have been used in either language, Greek at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the chief cities where Greek was commonly spoken, Syriac in the country. The oldest form of it now extant is the Greek version. Is it possible to find a relationship between it and other parent-uses? There are a number of very remarkable parallel passages between the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of this liturgy and the Canon of the Roman Mass. The order of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> is different, but when the Greek or Syriac is translated into Latin there appear a large number of phrases and clauses that are identical with ours. It has been suggested that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> originally used the same liturgy and that the much-disputed question of the order of our Canon may be solved by reconstructing it according to the Syrian use (Drews, Zur Entstehungsgeschichte des Kanons). Mgr. Duchesne and most authors, on the other hand, are disposed to connect the Gallican Liturgy with that of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and the Roman Mass with the Alexandrine use (Duchesne, Origines du culte chr&eacute;tien, 54).
<h2 id="section3">The Syriac liturgies</h2>

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451) both <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> and <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> continued using the same rite. But gradually the two languages became characteristic of the two sides. The <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> used only Syriac (their whole movement being a national revolt against the Emperor), and the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, who were nearly all Greeks in the chief towns, generally used Greek. The Syriac Liturgy of St. James now extant is not the original one used before the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, but a modified form derived from it by the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> for their own use. The preparation of the oblation has become a still more elaborate rite. The <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> comes at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> and after it this Syriac liturgy follows the Greek one almost word for word, including the reference to <a href="../cathen/14014c.htm">Sion</a>, the mother of all churches. But the list of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is modified; the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> commemorates the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> "who have kept undefiled the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Nic&aelig;a, Constantinople and Ephesus"; he names <a href="../cathen/08280a.htm">"James the brother of Our Lord"</a> alone of the Apostles and "most chiefly Cyril who was a tower of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, who expounded the incarnation of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and Mar James and Mar Ephraim, eloquent mouths and pillars of our holy Church." Mar James is Barada&#239;, through whom they have their orders, and from whom their name (543). Is Ephraim the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> who reigned there from 539-545, but who was certainly not a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>? The list of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, however, varies considerably; sometimes they introduce a long list of their patrons (<a href="../cathen/12769a.htm">Renaudot</a>, Lit. Orient. Col., II, 101-103). This liturgy still contains a famous clause. Just before the lessons the Trisagion is sung. That of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek rite</a> is: "Holy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, holy Strong one, holy Immortal one, have mercy on us." The Syriac rite adds after "holy Immortal one" the words: "who wast crucified for us." This is the addition made by Peter the Dyer (<em>gnaphe&uacute;s, fullos</em>) <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (458-471), which seemed to the Orthodox to conceal <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and which was adopted by the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> as a kind of proclamation of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In the Syriac use a number of Greek words have remained. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> says <em>st&ocirc;men kal&ocirc;s</em> in Greek and the people continually cry out "Kurillison", just as they say "Amen" and "Alleluia" in Hebrew. Short <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> forms constantly become fossilized in one language and count almost as inarticulate exclamations. The Greek ones in the Syriac liturgy show that the Greek language is the original. Besides the Syriac Liturgy of St. James, the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> have a large number of other <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a>, which they join to the common Preparation and Catechumen's Mass. The names of sixtly-four of these <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. They are attributed to various <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; thus, there are the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a> of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a>, St. Peter, St. Clement, <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus of Alexandria</a>, John Maro, <a href="../cathen/08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a> (died 708), Severus of Antioch (died 518), and so on. There is also a shortened <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of St. James of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. <a href="../cathen/12769a.htm">Renaudot</a> prints the texts of forty-two of these <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> in a Latin translation. They consist of different <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but the order is practically always that of the Syriac St. James Liturgy, and they are really local modifications of it. A letter written by <a href="../cathen/08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a> (c. 624) to a certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Timothy describes and explains the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Liturgy of his time (Assemani, Bibl. Orient., I, 479-486). It is the Syrian St. James. The Liturgy of the Presanctified of St. James (used on the week days of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> except Saturdays) follows the other one very closely. There is the Mass of the Catechumens with the little Entrance, the Lessons, Mass of the Faithful and great Entrance, <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>, Our Father, breaking of the Host, Communion, thanksgiving, and dismissal. Of course the whole <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Eucharistic prayer</a> is left out&mdash;the oblations are already <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as they lie on the Prothesis before the great Entrance (Brightman, op. cit., 494-501).
<h2 id="section4">The present time</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine still use the Syriac Liturgy of St. James, as do also the Syrian Uniates. The Orthodox of the two Patriarchates, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, have forsaken their own use for many centuries. Like all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in communion with Constantinople, they have adopted the Byzantine Rite. This is one result of the extreme centralization towards Constantinople that followed the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> conquests of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Palestine, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> Patriarchs of those countries, who had already lost nearly all their flocks through the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, became the merest shadows and eventually even left their sees to be ornaments of the courts at Constantinople. It was during that time, before the rise of the new national churches, that the Byzantine Patriarch developed into something very like a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> over the whole Orthodox world. And he succeeded in foisting the liturgy, calendar, and practices of his own <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> on the much older and more venerable sees of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. It is not possible to say exactly when the older uses were forsaken for that of Byzantium. <a href="../cathen/02226b.htm">Theodore Balsamon</a> says that by the end of the twelfth century the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> followed the Byzantine Rite. By that time Antioch had also doubtless followed suit. There are, however, two small exceptions. In the island of Zakynthos and in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> itself the Greek Liturgy of St. James was used on one day each year, 23 October, the feast of St. James the "brother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". It is still so used at Zakynthos, and in 1886 Dionysios Latas, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Zakynthos, published an edition of it for practical purposes. At <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> even this remnant of the old use had disappeared. But in 1900 Lord Damianos, the Orthodox Patriarch, revived it for one day in the year, not 23 October but 31 December. It was first celebrated again in 1900 (on 30 December as an exception) in the church of the Theological College of the Holy Cross. Lord Epiphanios, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">River Jordan</a>, celebrated, assisted by a number of concelebrating <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The edition of Latas was used, but the Archimandrite Chrysostomos Papadopoulos has been commissioned to prepare another and more correct edition (Echos d'Orient, IV, 247, 248). It should be noted finally that the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> use the Syrian St. James with a few very slight modifications, and that the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, Byzantine, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Liturgies are derived from that of Antioch.
