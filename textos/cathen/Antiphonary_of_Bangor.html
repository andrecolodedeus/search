<h1>Antiphonary of Bangor</h1>  

<p>An ancient Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, supposed to have been originally written at Bangor (<a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>).

<p>The codex, found by Muratori in the <a href="../cathen/01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and named by him the "Antiphonary of Bangor" ("Antiphonarium Benchorense"), was brought to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> from <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a> with many other books by <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal Federigo Borromeo</a> when he founded the <a href="../cathen/01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a> in 1609. Bobbio, which is situated in a gorge of the Apennines thirty-seven miles north-east of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, was founded by St. Columbanus, a disciple of St. Comgal, founder of the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Bangor on the south side of Belfast Lough in the county of Down. St. Columbanus died at <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a> and was buried there in 615. This establishes at once a connection between Bobbio and Bangor, and an examination of the contents of the codex placed it beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it was originally compiled in Bangor and brought thence to <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, not, however, in the time of <a href="../cathen/04137a.htm">St. Columbanus</a>. There is in the codex a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> entitled "<em>ymnum sancti Congilli abbatis nostri</em>", and he is referred to in it as "<em>nostri patroni Comgilli sancti</em>". Again there is a list of fifteen <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, beginning with Comgal and ending with Cronanus who died in 691; the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the compilation, therefore, may be referred to 680-691. Muratori, however, is careful to state in his preface that the codex, though very old, and in part mutilated, may have been a copy made at <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, by some of the local <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> there, from the original service book. It is written, as regards the orthography, the form of the letters, and the dotted ornamentation of the capital letters, in "the Scottic style", but this, of course, may have been done by Gaelic <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>. The actual bearer of the codex from Bangor is generally supposed and stated to have been St. Dungal, who left <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> early in the ninth century, acquired great celebrity on the Continent, and probably retired to Bobbio towards the close of his life. He bequeathed his books to "the blessed Columbanus", i.e., to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">antiphonary</a>, however, cannot be identified with any of the books named in the catalogue of the books bequeathed by Dungal, as given by Muratori (Antiquitatis Italicae Medii Aevi, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1740, III, 817-824). Here only a summary can be given of the contents of the codex to which the name of "Antiphonary" will be found to be not very applicable: (1) six canticles; (2) twelve metrical <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>; (3) sixty-nine collects for use at the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>; (4) special collects; (5) seventy anthems, or versicles; (6) the Creed; (7) the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a>. The most famous item in the contents is the venerable Eucharistic <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Sancti venite Christi corpus sumite", which is not found in any other ancient text. It was sung at the Communion of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and is headed, "Ymnum quando comonicarent sacerdotes". A text of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> from the old <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Of Bobbio, with a literal translation, is given in "Essays on the Discipline and Constitution of the Early Irish Church," (p. 166) by <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>, who refers to it as that "golden fragment of our ancient <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Liturgy". The Creed in this codex differs in its wording from all other forms known to exist. It is in substance the original Creed of Nicaea. It does not contain the <em>ex Patre Filioque procedit</em>, but merely states the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousia</a></em> of the three Persons of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>.
