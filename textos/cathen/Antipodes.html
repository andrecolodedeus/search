<h1>Antipodes</h1>  

<p>Speculations concerning the rotundity of the earth and the possible existence of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human beings</a> "with their feet turned towards ours" were of interest to the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Early Church</a> only in so far as they seemed to encroach upon the fundamental <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the unity of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and the consequent universality of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>. This is clearly seen from the following passage of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (<a href="../fathers/120116.htm"><em>City of God</em> XVI.9</a>):

<blockquote><p>"As to the fable that there are Antipodes, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> on the opposite side of the earth, where the sun rises when it sets on us, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who walk with their feet opposite ours, there is no reason for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> it. Those who affirm it do not claim to possess any actual information; they merely conjecture that, since the earth is suspended within the concavity of the heavens, and there is as much room on the one side of it as on the other, therefore the part which is beneath cannot be void of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> inhabitants. They fail to notice that, even should it be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> or demonstrated that the world is round or spherical in form, it does not follow that the part of the earth opposite to us is not completely covered with water, or that any conjectured dry land there should be inhabited by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For Scripture, which confirms the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of its historical statements by the accomplishment of its <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecies</a>, teaches not falsehood; and it is too absurd to say that some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> might have set sail from this side and, traversing the immense expanse of ocean, have propagated there a race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human beings</a> descended from that one <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>."</p></blockquote>

<p>This opinion of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was commonly held until the progress of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, whilst confirming his main contention that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is one, dissipated the scruples arising from a defective <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06447a.htm">geography</a>. A singular exception occurs to us in the middle of the eighth century. From a letter of <a href="../cathen/15743b.htm">Pope St. Zachary</a> (1 May, 748), addressed to <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, we learn that the great Apostle of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> had invoked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> censure upon a certain missionary among the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarians</a> named <a href="../cathen/15353d.htm">Vergilius</a>, generally supposed to be identical with the renowned Ferghil, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irishman</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>. Among other alleged misdeeds and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> was numbered that of holding "that beneath the earth there was another world and other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, another sun and moon". In reply, the <a href="../cathen/15743b.htm">Pope</a> directs <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> to convoke a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">council</a> and, "if it be made clear" that <a href="../cathen/15353d.htm">Vergilius</a> adheres to this "perverse teaching, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> and to his own soul", to "expel him from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Church</a>, deprived of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity". This is the only information that we possess regarding an incident which is made to figure largely in the imaginary <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> between <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">theology and science</a>. That <a href="../cathen/15353d.htm">Vergilius</a> was ever really tried, condemned, or forced to retract, is an assumption without any foundation in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a>. On the contrary, if he was in fact the future <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, it is more natural to conclude that he succeeded in convincing his censors that by "other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>" he did not understand a race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human beings</a> not descended from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redeemed</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>; for it is patent that this was the feature of his teaching which appeared to the <a href="../cathen/15743b.htm">Pope</a> to be "perverse" and "contrary to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>".

<p>Instead of narrow censure, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> deserve our highest esteem for having, throughout the ages, firmly upheld the important <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the universal brotherhood of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. At the same time we recognize that the case of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who suffered the penalty of being several centuries in advance of his age remains on the page of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a>, like the parallel case of <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a>, as a solemn admonition against a hasty resort to <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">ecclesiastical censures</a>.
