<h1>Antivari</h1>  

<p>(<em>Antibarium</em>)

<p>So called from its position opposite to <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10529c.htm">archiepiscopal see of Montenegro</a>. By the treaty of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> (1879) this ancient seaport of <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albania</a> was adjudged to the little inland principality of the Black Mountain and shortly after (1886) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Archdiocese was declared <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and relieved of its suffragans Alessio, <a href="../cathen/12561b.htm">Pulati</a>, <a href="../cathen/02407a.htm">Belgrade</a>, and Sappa, henceforth attached to Scutari. The See of Antivari claims to date from the fifth century; it was certainly an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> in the ninth and was refounded in the course of the twelfth century. In the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Antivari remained subject to the Greek emperors; later it became one of the numerous little Dalmatian republics that chose their own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and rulers, and finally fell under the sway of the Serb kings. Towards the beginning of the thirteenth century it sought union with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, but fifty years later became subject to Lewis of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, who lost it in turn, to the Balza princes of Teuta, and with these it returned eventually to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1450). For almost a century Antivari enjoyed the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of peace under <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> dominion, and her commerce flourished to the highest degree, but in 1538, while Sultan Selim II was striving against the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, the pasha of <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a> besieged Antivari. After fierce combats he was forced to retire, but in 1571 through the treachery of its governor, Donato, the town fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The conditions of capitulation were honourable, but the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> ceasing to respect them, one half of the citizens went into <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> exile in order to preserve their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while the other half embraced <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. John VIII, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Antivari, who had vainly tried to make Donato offer resistance to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and handed over to Ali-Pasha, commander of the fleet. Ali exhibited him everywhere dressed in his pontifical vestments and put him to death after the battle of <a href="../cathen/09181b.htm">Lepanto</a> (7 Oct., 1571). In 1649 Foscolo, governor of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Republic, was persuaded by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Antivari and a deputation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to come to their aid. His movements were betrayed to the pasha of <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a>, who surprised his troops before they could re-embark, and massacred a great number. Once more, in 1717, the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> governor of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> tried to deliver Antivari, but the attempt was again fruitless. At last, in 1878, Prince Nicola of Montenegro victoriously entered the ancient town and incorporated it with Montenegro.

<p>The city has a population of about 8,000, many of whom are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>. It is built on a lofty precipitous site and offers now few traces of its ancient grandeur; the streets are narrow, of a <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> aspect, and the houses miserable. Nevertheless thirty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, it is said, were once found within its walls. The old castle is a ruin, but the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. George, formerly transformed into a mosque, is well preserved. A few miles outside Antivari, near Cape Volinizza, is the Virgin's Rock, theme of many a national poet, whence in the time of Sultan Selim (1524-73) a young girl threw herself into the sea rather than fall into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>.

<p>The population of <a href="../cathen/10529c.htm">Montenegro</a> (1906) is about 300,000, with some 6,789 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. There are 27 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 12 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and 9 religious. Until the close of the Russo-Turkish War (1878) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Montenegro were subject to the Vicar-Apostolic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A concordat between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the Prince of Montenegro (18 Aug., 1886) now regulates the status of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the principality. By its terms the exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion is declared free; the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is chosen without interference of the state, but must be an acceptable choice (persona grata); the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is declared <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is to receive the title of "Illustrissimo Monsignore" and to enjoy a yearly pension of 5,000 francs. The government also pledges itself to keep yearly at its expense one student in the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whence have come for a long time the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> of this territory. Moreover, at the request of the Prince of Montenegro, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the Old-Slavonic Liturgy was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (originally conceded by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, in 1248, and renewed by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> and <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>). It is in reality the Roman Liturgy translated into Old-Slavonic, and in this shape is in use among eighty or a hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of Trieste, Goerz, <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Spalato</a>, <a href="../cathen/13668d.htm">Sebenico</a>, and other Dalmatian centres. Until lately it was printed in the Cyrillic alphabet, but since 1890, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has permitted the use of the <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> alphabet, to avoid similarity of usage with their <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> neighbours. (See CYRIL AND METHODIUS.) A copy of the new <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missal</a>, printed at the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> press in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Ordo et Canon Missae Slavice, 1887) was presented by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1893 to the Prince of Montenegro. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Congregation of the Consistory (7 March, 1902) Antivari is declared the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> see of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which it enjoyed as early as the twelfth century. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Monsignor Simon Milinovic, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> elected 8 Oct., 1886.
