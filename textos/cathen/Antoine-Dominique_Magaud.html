<h1>Antoine-Dominique Magaud</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> 1817; d. there, 1899. He studied in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> under L&eacute;on Cogniet. The most important of his works are at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, where he presided over the Ecole des Beaux Arts so successfully that he was entitled to be called its second founder. Magaud's talent was universal; his portraits, and especially that of himself, are remarkable; then he took up landscape <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, and has left us among others" A view taken from St. Martha's near <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>; his genre <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> include a famous "Bashi-Bazouk calling up Spirits". But it is principally in his decorative compositions that his real greatness is shown. In <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> he decorated the Caf&eacute; de France, the Chamber of Commerce, the Library, the Grand-Hotel, the Prefecture. His masterpiece in work of this kind is the historical gallery of the <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> Religious Association. This gallery comprises fifteen canvases, four metres by two, and a ceiling nine metres. The subject to be treated was a pictorial glorification of the benefits of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization. The main theme is set forth on the ceiling in a vast symbolical composition representing religion as the inspiration of Learning, Science and Art. On the side walls of the gallery the following subjects appear: Philosophy, personified by <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> endeavouring to prove to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, Tryphon, the superiority of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; Theology is represented by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> on a visit to <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, Languages and Literature by Palatine School of Charlemagne and <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>; Justice by St. Louis seated under the oak of Vincennes; Eloquence by <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> preaching the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a> at V&eacute;zelay; Poetry by <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> in rapt contemplation of the heavens. Then comes <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Christopher Columbus</a> landing at <a href="../cathen/13450b.htm">San Salvador</a> and thanking <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for having given him the grace "of carrying His name and His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion beyond the confines of the known stars"; next, <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, submitting plans for <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's Basilica</a> to <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a>; <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a> on his knees before <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, pleading the cause of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">sacred music</a>; Father Cataldino evangelizing the Indians during the conquest of <a href="../cathen/11470b.htm">Paraguay</a>; Conde thanking <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the victory of Rocroi; Mgr de Belzunce ministering to the plague-stricken; <a href="../cathen/15503a.htm">Volta</a> in his laboratory at <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a> among his alembics and his retorts giving thanks to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Science, finally <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> teaching history to the Dauphin.

<p>This ensemble of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> is assuredly one of the most beautiful works of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian Art</a> during the nineteenth century. Without going to <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> we can form some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of it by turning over the leaves of the album in which Sirouy has skillfully reproduced the various subjects of this vast epopee. Magaud has shown in many other less important <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, that he could treat artistic subjects with the mind of an enlightened <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. For instance, "The Probatica Pool"; "The Slaughter of the Innocents"; "The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, aided by their brethren"; "The Holy Family" in St. Lazarus's Church, Marrseilles, eight decorative compositions for the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the "Carmelins" founded in 1621 by the officers of the Confraternity of the Scapular; "Jeremias reproaching the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with their ill-deeds".
