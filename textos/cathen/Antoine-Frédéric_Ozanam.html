<h1>Antoine-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Ozanam</h1>  

<p>Great grand-nephew of <a href="../cathen/11378b.htm">Jacques Ozanam</a>. Born at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 23 April, 1813; died at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, 8 September, 1853. His father, settled at first in Lyons as a merchant, after reverses of fortune decided to go to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Later he returned to Lyons and became a physician. At eighteen Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric, in defence of the Faith, wrote <em>R&eacute;flexions sur la doctrine de Saint-Simon.</em> Later he studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and lived for eighteen months with the illustrious physician Amp&egrave;re. He formed an intimate friendship with the latter's son, Jean-Jacques Amp&egrave;re, well known later for his works on literature and history. Meanwhile he became a prey of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt.</a> He said, <blockquote> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave me the grace to be born in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Later the confusion of an unbelieving world surrounded me. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all the horror of the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> that torment the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It was then that the instructions of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> (Abb&eacute; Noirot) saved me. I believed thenceforth with an assured <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and touched by so rare a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. I promised <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to devote my life to the services of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which had given me peace. </blockquote>

<p>Rarely was a promise more faithfully fulfilled.

<p>In 1836 he left <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he had known <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a>, Ballanche, <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, and was appointed to the bench at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, but two years later returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to submit his thesis on <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> for his doctorate in letters. His defence was a triumph. "Monsieur Ozanam", Cousin said to the candidate, "there is no one more eloquent than you have just <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> yourself." He was given the chair of commercial law, just created at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. The following year he competed for admission to the Faculties at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and was appointed to substitute for one of the judges of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, <a href="../cathen/06018b.htm">Fauriel</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and professor of foreign literature. At the same time he taught at Stanislas College, where he had been called by <a href="../cathen/06731b.htm">Abb&eacute; Gratry</a>. On <a href="../cathen/06018b.htm">Fauriel's</a> death in 1844, the Faculty unanimously elected Ozanam his successor.

<p>Like his friend <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> he believed that a <a href="../cathen/04708a.htm">Christian democracy</a> was the end towards which Providence was leading the world, and after the Revolution of 1848 aided him by his writings in the <em>Ere Nouvelle.</em> In 1846 he visited <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to regain his strength, undermined by a fever. On his return he published <em>Etudes germaniques</em> (1847); <em>Po&egrave;tes franciscains en Italie au XIIIe si&egrave;cle</em>; finally, in 1849, the greatest of his works: <em>La civilisation chretienne chez les Francs</em>. The Academy of Inscriptions awarded him the "Grand Prix Gobert" for two successive years. In 1852 he made a short journey to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> an account of which is found in the posthumous work: <em>Un p&eacute;l&eacute;rinage au pays du Cid.</em>

<p>In the beginning of the next year, his <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> again sent him to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but he returned to <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> to die. When the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> exhorted him to have confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he replied "Oh why should I fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> so much?" Complying with his desire the Government allowed him to be <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the "Carmes".

<p>A brilliant <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a>, impressed by the benefits of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, he desired that they should be made known to all who might read his works or hear his words. To him the Gospel had renewed or revivified all the germs of good to be found in the ancient and in the barbarian world. In his many miscellaneous studies he endeavored to develop this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, but was unable to fully realize his plan. In the two volumes of the <em>Etudes germaniques</em> he did for one nation what he desired to do for all. He also published, with the same view, a valuable collection of hitherto unpublished material: <em>Documents in&eacute;dits pour servir a l'histoire de l'Italie, depuis le VIII siecle jusqu'au XIIe</em> (Paris, 1850). Ozanam was untiring in energy, had a rare gift for precision and historical insight, and at the same time a naturalness in his verse and a spontaneous, pleasing eloquence, all the more charming because of his frankness. He wrote, <blockquote> Those who wish no religion introduced into a scientific work accuse me of a lack of independence. But I <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> myself on such an accusation. . . I do not aspire to an independence, the result of which is to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and to believe nothing. </blockquote>

<p>His daily life was animated by an <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>. He was one of those who signed the petition addressed to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to obtain a large body of religious teachers for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> children, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was endangered by the current unbelief. As a result of this petition Monseigneur de Quelen created the famous "Conf&eacute;rences de Notre Dame", which <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> inaugurated in 1835. When but twenty, Ozanam with seven companions had laid the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, in order, as he said to "insure my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>". During his life he was an active member and a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> propagator of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. With all his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, he was, however, tolerant. His strong, sincere books exhibit a brilliant and animated style, enthusiasm and erudition, eloquence and exactness, and are yet very useful introductions to the subjects of which they treat.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Ozanam was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by Pope John Paul II on August 22, 1997.]
