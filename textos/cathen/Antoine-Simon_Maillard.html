<h1>Antoine-Simon Maillard</h1>  

<p>Missionary b. in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (parentage, place and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown); d. 12 August, 1762. He was sent to Acadia by the French Seminary of Foreign Missions in 1735. In 1740 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, and resided at Louisbourg until its fall in, 1745, after which he retired to the woods and ministered to the dispersed Acadians and Indians of Cape Breton, St. John's (Prince Edward) Island, and the eastern coast of <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadia</a> (Nova Scotia). He was the first to acquire a complete mastery of the extremely difficult language of the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmacs</a>, for whom he composed a hieroglyphic alphabet, a grammar, a dictionary, a <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayerbook</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, and a series of sermons. Although credited with the gift of tongues, he had devoted over eight years to his task. Maillard was the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> tolerated by the English in <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadia</a>. When the Indians, to avenge British barbarity towards the Acadians and their missionaries, massacred every English subject that strayed within their reach, the Government appealed to Maillard, whose influence wrought an immediate change. In recognition, he was invited to <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a>, where a church was built for him, and he received a pension of 200 pounds, the free exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> being conceded to all his coreligionists, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> as well as Acadian and Indian. From Halifax he addressed to the scattered groups letters that were read with veneration like the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. At death's hour, after thirty years of laborious ministry, being without any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to administer the last rites, he was visited by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> parson, Thomas Wood, who offered his ministration. Calmly and gently Maillard refused, saying: "I have served <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all my life, and each day I have prepared for death by offering up the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>." Thus vanishes the legend of his request to Wood to read the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the sick from the English ritual. His body alone could the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> claim, and they <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> it with great demonstrations of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. He is justly named the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmacs</a>, by whom he is still held in great veneration, and who, in spite of many trials and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, have preserved, with their language, the Faith he taught them.
