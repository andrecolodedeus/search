<h1>Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle</h1>  

<p>Known in history as CARDINAL DE GRANVELLE (GRANVELLA).

<p>Born at Ornans in Franche-Comt&eacute;, 20 August, 1517; died at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 21 September, 1586. He was the son of Nicolas Perrenot, prime minister of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, studied at Padua and <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and at an early age was introduced by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to political life. Ecclesiastical favours and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> were showered upon the young man. He became prothonotary Apostolic in 1529, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, and was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> in 1538 at the age of twenty-one. He resided very little in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and lived at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, where he had an active share in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> political negotiations. He was charged with addressing the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in the name of the emperor (9 Jan., 1543), and took an active part in all the important affairs of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, e.g. the interview of <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>, the Peace of Crepy (1544), the Interim, and the marriage of Philip II with <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Mary Tudor of England</a>. In 1550 he succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> as keeper of the emperor's seal, but did not bear the title of chancellor. His influence continued to grow under Philip II. he was name <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> in 1559 and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1561.

<p>As member of the Council of State of the Low Countries he was the most valued counsellor of the regent, Margaret of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>; apropos of this it must be remembered that when leaving the country Philip II recommended his sister to refer all important affairs to a council of three, one of whom should be Granvelle. He was in direct correspondence with the king, and freely judged and criticized the regent. So much power aroused the jealousy of the nobility, especially that of the Prince of Orange and the Comt&eacute; d'Egmont, the chief personages of the Low Countries, who were indignant at seeing Granvelle preferred before them. Every means was employed to stir up popular opinion against him, caricature, song, and pamphlet. The regent and even the king himself were besieged with protests. Finally the nobles declared that they would refrain from assisting at the Council of State as long as they should meet the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> there. The king believed it prudent to sacrifice his favourite in the face of such stubborn and fierce hostility. Accordingly Granvelle was "authorized to visit his mother in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>" (1564). He was never to see the Low Countries again, though on his departure he left behind his papers, books, and pictures, in the hope of a speedy return. He withdrew to his native <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, whence he continued to correspond with the king. By the latter he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1565, where he took an active part in the formation of the Holy League, which resulted in the celebrated victory of <a href="../cathen/09181b.htm">Lepanto</a>. In 1571 the king named him viceroy of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, which post he held until 1575 and then returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1577 Philip II offered to allow him to return to the Low Countries under Margaret of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> refused to return to a country which he had left under such humiliating circumstances, and where he could not longer be of use. The king summoned him to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> (1579). At <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, as at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was a faithful and valued counsellor, though towards the end his repute seems to have diminished. Having resigned from his <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Archdiocese of Mechlin</a>, he received that of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> in 1584. He died at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, and was buried at <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, but his remains were scattered during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>.

<p>Comely of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, speaking seven languages, liberal, of an even disposition, unswervingly faithful to his masters, possessing great political penetration, and of an astonishing activity, Granvelle was moreover a generous and enlightened patron of arts and letters. He has been reproached with <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>; in fact he was never satiated with riches and honours, but was unskilled in the art of gaining popularity. Exclusively preoccupied with the service of his masters, he scorned to win the affection of the multitude, and was a much detested in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. Owing to his great influence he was held responsible for everything that was done, even when he had advised against it. Worldly and ostentatious, and more than once accused of laxity of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, Granvelle possessed the qualities and defects of a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, with a superiority of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and sense of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as a statesman which deserve respect. His vast correspondence is an inexhaustible source of information concerning the history of the sixteenth century. It might also be said, writes the celebrated archivist, Gachard, that no minister ever wrote as much as the Cardinal de Granvelle. His correspondence has been edited partly in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by Weiss, "Les papiers d'&eacute;tatde Granvelle" (9 vols., 4to, 1841-52), partly in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, "La correspondence du cardinal Granvelle" (12 vols., 4to, 1878-96), the first three volumes by E. Poullet, the remainder by Ch. Piat.
