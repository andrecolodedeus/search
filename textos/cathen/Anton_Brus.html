<h1>Anton Brus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, b. at. Muglitz in <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, 13 February, 1518; d. 28 August, 1580. After receiving his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at Prague he joined the <a href="../cathen/08671a.htm">Knights of the Cross</a> with the Red Star, an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order established in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> in the thirteenth century. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> Emperor Ferdinand appointed him <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> army, in which capacity he served during the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (1542-45). He was elected Grand Master General of his order in 1552, when he was only 34 years of age. In 1558 he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; in 1561 the emperor made him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, a see which had remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> since 1421 when Archbishop Conrad abandoned his flock and entered the Hussite camp. During the intervening years the archdiocese was governed by administrators elected by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. Before Archbishop Brus took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, Emperor Ferdinand I, who was also King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, sent him as <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1562). Besides other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms, he urged the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to advocate the expediency of permitting the Utraquists, or Calixtines, of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and adjoining countries to receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> under both species; he hoped that after this concession many of the Utraquists would return to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was ably assisted in his endeavours by the imperial delegate from <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, Bishop George Draskovich of Funfkirchen (P&eacute;cs), and by Baumg&auml;rtner, the delegate of Duke Albrecht V of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Brus could not be present at the twenty-first and the twenty-second sessions of the Council, during which this petition of the emperor was discussed. The majority of the fathers of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> considered it beyond their power to grant the privilege of lay communion under both kinds and referred the matter to <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pope Pius IV</a>, who, in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 16 April, 1564, granted the petition, with certain restrictions, to the subjects of the emperor and of Duke Albrecht of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> was to empower certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to administer the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> in both kinds to such of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> as desired it. The faithful who wished to take advantage of this privilege were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to profess their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> of the whole Christ in each species, while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the administration of each species pronounced the formula: "Corpus <em>et sanguis</em> Domini nostri Jesu Christi custodiant animam tuam in vitam aeternam. Amen." instead of the customary formula: "Corpus Domini nostri," etc.

<p>The emperor and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> expected great results from this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> concession. Thinking that the Utraquist consistory at Prague would at once accept all <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, the emperor put it under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Both, however, were soon undeceived. The Utraquist consistory was ready to present its <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> candidates to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, but there his authority was to end. They refused to permit their candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to undergo examination on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> or to give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and complained to the emperor that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was infringing upon their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>.

<p>Had Ferdinand not died at this critical moment, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> concession would perhaps have produced some salutary effects, but under the weak rule of his son Maximilian, who became emperor in 1564, the gulf that separated the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the Utraquists was continually widening. In order to publish and put into execution the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> intended to convene a provincial synod at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>; but Maximilian, fearing to offend the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> nobility of whom the majority were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, withheld his consent. Hampered on all sides, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and the small body of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nobles, despite their almost superhuman efforts, could only postpone the impending crisis. The Utraquists no longer heeded the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> commands, continued to administer the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> to infants, disregarded many decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, neglected sacramental confession--in a word, were steering straight towards <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. After 1572, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> refused to ordain Utraquist candidates, despite the expostulations of Emperor Maximilian. The death of Maximilian (12 October, 1576) brought no relief to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and his ever-decreasing flock of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. His successor, Emperor Rudolph II, though a good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> at heart, was as weak as his predecessor. After the death of Brus the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> continued on their downward course until the victory of Ferdinand II over the <em>Winterk&ouml;nig</em> Frederick V at the White Mountain near Prague (8 November, 1620).
