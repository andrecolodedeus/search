<h1>Anton Dereser</h1>  

<p>(Known also as THADDAEUS A S. ADAMO).

<p>Born at Fahr in Franconia, 3 February, 1757; died at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, 15 or 16 June, 1807. He was a Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, professed at Cologne 18 Oct., 1777. During his studies at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a>, where he graduated, acquired such renown that contrary to the custom of the order he was allowed to accept a professorship in <a href="../cathen/07271a.htm">hermeneutics</a> and oriental languages, first at his own alma mater, then at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> (1783-1791). In the last-named year he was sent to Strasburg where he also filled the posts of preacher and of <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> at the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Having refused the Constitutional <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, but the capital punishment was commuted into one of deportation. It is not quite clear whether this was put into execution; certain it is that with the fall of Robespierre he regained his liberty and returned with shattered health to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a> (1796). The Margrave of Baden withholding his consent to Dereser's acceptance of the office of coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, he was transferred with the whole <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to Freiburg (1807), but having given offence by a funeral sermon (1810) had to leave suddenly for <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. Thence he went to Lucerne as professor and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, but was expelled on account of his <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> teaching, and turned, on invitation, to Breslau as canon and professor (1815). Dereser's combative character got him in trouble everywhere, and, though <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> himself a good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, he was imbued with <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a>, anti- Roman spirit, and with the shallow <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> of his time, explaining away everything <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> in Scripture and religion. All his writings are thus tainted, thought only one, and that without the name of the author, has been placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a>, "Commentario biblica in . . . Tu es Petrus" (Bonn, 1789). His principal work, the continuation of Dominic de Brentano's German Bible (Frankfort, 1815-1828, 16 vols.) received permanent value only through the revision by <a href="../cathen/13553a.htm">J.M.A. Scholz</a> (1828-1837, 17 vols.). Other works, chiefly Latin, were on the "Necessity of the Knowledge of Oriental Languages for the Study of Scripture" (Cologne, 1783); Hermeneutics of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (1784 and 1786); Dissertations on the Destruction of Sodom (1784); on St. John Baptist (1785); on the Power and Duties of the Pope according to St. Bernard (1787); on a number of books and portions of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> with translations (partly metrical) and annotations; on the "Temptation of Christ (1789); on His Divinity and on Pharisaism" (Strasburg, 1791); on the "Foundation of the <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">University of Bonn</a> (1786); a "German Breviary" (Augsburg, 1793, several times reprinted) and a "German <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book (Rottenburg, 1808). He also edited A. Frenzel's Treatise on Matrimony (Breslau, 1818), in which the indissolubility is denied; the author afterwards retracted it.
