<h1>Anton G&uuml;nther</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">Philosopher</a>; b. 17 Nov., 1783, at Lindenau, near <a href="../cathen/09141a.htm">Leitmeritz</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 24 February, 1863. From 1796 to 1800 he attended the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a> at Haide, and from 1800 to 1803 the gymnasium of <a href="../cathen/09141a.htm">Leitmeritz</a>. Subsequently he studied at Prague philosophy and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. After completing these studies he became a tutor in the household of Prince Bretzenheim. The religious views of the young man, the son of devout <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, had been sadly shaken during the years of his student life by his study of the modern systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> (<a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, Fichte, Jacob, Schelling); but his removal in 1811 to Br&uuml;nn near <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> with the princely <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> mentioned above brought him under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of this place, named Korn, and particularly of <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Saint Clement Mary Hofbauer</a>, and restored him to firm <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> convictions. He then took up the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, first at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and afterwards at Raab, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, where in 1820 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. In 1822 he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Starawicz, Galicia, but left it in 1824. For the rest of his life he resided at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> as a private ecclesiastic, and until 1848 occupied a position in that city as member of the State Board of book Censorship.

<p>From 1818 G&uuml;nther was active in the world of letters as contributor to the "Viennese Literary Chronicle" (Wiener Jahrb&uuml;cher der Literatur). In 1828 began to appear the series of works in which he expounded his peculiar system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and speculative <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>: "Vorschule zur speculativen Theologie des positiven Christenthums" (Introduction to the Speculative Theology of Positive Christianity), in letter form; part I: "Die Creationstheorie" (The Theory of Creation); part II "Die Incarnationstheorie" (The Theory of the Incarnation) (1st ed., Vienna, 1828-9; 2nd ed., 1846-8); "Peregrins Gastmahl. Eine Idylle in elf Octaven aus dem deutschen wissenschaftlichen Volksleben, mit Beitr&#228;gen zur Charakteristik europ&#228;ischer Philosophie in &#228;lterer und neuerer Zeit" (Vienna, 1830; new ed., 1850); "S&uuml;d- und Nordlichter am Horizont speculativer Theologie, Fragment eines evangelischen Briefwechsels" (Vienna, 1832; new ed., 1850); "Janusk&ouml;pfe f&uuml;r Philosophie und Theologie" (in collaboration with J. H. Pabst; Vienna, 1833); "Der letzte Symboliker. Eine durch die symbolischen Werke Dr. J. A. M&ouml;hlers und Dr. F. C. Baurs veranlasste Schrift in Briefen" (Vienna, 1834); "Thomas a Scrupulis. Zur Transfiguration der Pers&ouml;nlichkeits-Pantheismen neuester Zeit" (Vienna, 1835); "Die Juste-Milieus in der deutschen Philosophie gegenw&#228;rtiger Zeit" (Vienna, 1838); "Eurystheus und Herakles. Metalogische Kritiken und Meditationen" (Vienna, 1843). A new edition of these eight works, collected into nine volumes, appeared at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1882 under the title of G&uuml;nther's "Gesammelte Schriften". In addition to these, G&uuml;nther produced in conjunction with <a href="../cathen/15322b.htm">J.E. Veith</a>: "Lydia, Philosophisches Jahrbuch" (5 volumes, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1849-54). A work, "Lentigos und Peregrins Briefwechsel", was printed in 1857, but was issued only for private circulation. Finally, long after G&uuml;nther's death, Knoodt published from his posthumous papers "Anti-Savarese" (Vienna, 1883).

<p>In all his scientific work, G&uuml;nther aimed at the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> confutation of the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> of modern philosophy, especially in its most seductive form, the <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a>, by originating such a system of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy as would better serve this purpose than the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> system which he rejected, and would demonstrate clearly, even from the standpoint of natural reason, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of positive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. As against this <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, he seeks a speculative basis for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> "Creationism" in the twofold <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the world, and, within the world, of spirit and nature; he furthermore strives to demonstrate scientifically that the fundamental teachings of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, and even the mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation, at least in their <em>raison d'&#234;tre</em> if not in their form, are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> in the mere light of reason. He would thus change <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> into <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. A systematic and complete development of his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> is not given in any of his works, not even in his "Introduction to Speculative Theology", in which one would most naturally look for it. Abounding in polemic against widely divergent <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, of a style aphoristic, often quaintly humorous, and sparkling with flashes of genius, but frequently such in form and tenor as to prove little palatable to the reader, G&uuml;nther's writings contain only sporadic fragments of his thought.

<p>The starting-point of G&uuml;nther's speculation is his theory of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Man is endowed with a twofold faculty of thought, the one a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> or conceptual function, which deals with appearances, and the other ontological, ideal, self-conscious, which penetrates through appearances to being; hence it is inferred that there are in man two essentially different thinking subjects. This "dualism of thought" establishes the <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> of spirit (<em>Geist</em>) and nature in man, who thus exhibits their synthesis. The subject of the conceptual function is the "mind" (<em>Seele</em>), which belongs to the nature-principle (<em>Naturprincip</em>). From the "mind" must be distinguished the "soul" (<em>Geist</em>), which differs from the former essentially as the subject of ideal thought. The first result of this ideal thought-process is self-consciousness, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which man acquires of himself as a real being. The immediate object of inner perception is the conditions or states of the Ego, which make their appearance as the expressions of the two primary functions, "receptivity" and "spontaneity", when these are called into activity by influences from without. Inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> refers the manifestations of these two forces to the one principle and contradistinguishes itself as a real being from whatever appears before it, it arrives at the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Ego. By this speculative process, which G&uuml;nther calls a "metalogical" or ideal (<em>ideell</em>) inference, as distinct from a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> or conceptual conclusion, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of its own being becomes for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the most certain of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> (the <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> <em>cogito ergo sum</em>). Then from the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of its own existence the thinking <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> arrives at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of an existence outside itself, since it is confronted by phenomena which it cannot refer to itself as cause, and for which, in line with the ontological inference, it must assign a cause in some real being external to itself.



<p>Thus regarding man as a compound of two qualitatively different principles, spirit and nature, he arrives at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the real existence of nature. The fact of self-consciousness leads him also to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and G&uuml;nther believes that the following <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> is the only one that is possible and conclusive: when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, once self-conscious, has become certain of the reality of its own existence, it immediately recognizes that existence as afflicted with the negative characteristics of dependency and limitedness; it is therefore compelled to postulate another being as its own condition precedent or its own creator, which being it must recognize, in contradistinction to itself and its own inherent negative characteristics, as absolute and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Wherefore this being cannot be the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">Absolute Being</a> of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, which only arrives at a realization of itself with the development of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; it must be One Who dominates that <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and, differing substantially from it, is the personal Creator thereof. This is the point at which G&uuml;nther's speculative <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> takes up the thread. Proceeding along purely <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> lines, and prescinding entirely from historical Divine Revelation, the absolute necessity of which G&uuml;nther contests, it seeks to make evident the fundamental tenets of positive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by the mere light of reason. Thus, to begin with, the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">threefold personality of God</a> is, according to him, the consequence of that process which must be supposed to take place in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as well as in the created <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whereby the differentiation or transition is made from indeterminateness to determinateness, with the difference that this process in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must be thought of as consummated from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to this theory, first sets up for His own contemplation a complete substantial emanation (<em>Wesensemanation</em>) of His own Being (Thesis and Antithesis: Father and Son); a further total substantial emanation, which issues from both simultaneously, constitutes the third personal Subject (the Holy Ghost), or the Synthesis, in which the opposition of thesis and antithesis disappears and their perfect parity is made manifest.

<p>On his views concerning the Trinity, G&uuml;nther builds up his theory of the Creation. Inseparably united with the self-consciousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the three Divine Persons is His <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Non-Ego, that is, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Universe. This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, in formal analogy to the threefold Divine Being and Life, has likewise a threefold scheme of Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for this world-idea is His motive for realizing it as His own counterpart (Contraposition), and as necessarily entailing all three of its factors, two of which (spirit and nature) are in antithesis to each other, while the third (man) exists as the synthesis of both. This world-reality, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the mere act of His will, has through creation called from nothingness into being, does indeed exist as really as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself; its reality, however, is not drawn from the essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but endures as a thing essentially different from Him, since it is indeed the realized <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of non-Divine Being and Life (<a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism of God and Universe</a>). Thus the two antithetical factors of spirit and nature in the created world differ substantially from each other and stand in mutual opposition. The antithetical relation of spirit and nature shows itself in this, that the realm of the purely spiritual is formed of a plurality of substances, of unitary and integral real principles, each of which must ever retain its unity and its integrity; while nature, which was created a single substance, a single real principle, has in its process of differentiation lost its unity for ever, and has brought forth, and still brings forth, a multiplicity of forms or <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. For this very reason nature, in her organic individual manifestations, each of which is only a fragment of the universal nature-substance, can only attain to thought without self-consciousness. Self-conscious thought, on the other hand, is peculiar to the spirit, since self-consciousness, the thought of the Ego, presupposes the substantial unity and integrity of a free <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. The synthesis of spirit and nature is man. From man's character as a generic being, the result of his participation in the life of nature, G&uuml;nther deduces the rational basis of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the Incarnation and Redemption. And, as this explains why the guilt of the first parent extends to the entire race, so also does it show how <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could with perfect consistency bring about the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of the race which had fallen in Adam through the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">God-Man's</a> union with that race as its second Head, Whose free compliance with the Divine will laid the basis of the fund of hereditary merit which serves to cancel the inherited guilt.

<p>G&uuml;nther was a faithful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and a devout <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. His <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> labours were at any rate a sincere and honest endeavour to promote the triumph of positive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> over those systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which were inimical to it. But it is questionable whether he pursued the right course in disregarding the fruitful labours of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic theology and philosophy</a>&mdash;of which, like all who scorn them, he had but scanty <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>&mdash;and permitting his thought, particularly in his natural philosophy, and his speculative method to be unduly influenced by those very systems (of <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> and Schelling) which he combated. The fact is that the desired result was in no wise attained. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which he thought he could compel, by turning their own weapons against them, to recognize the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, took practically no notice of his ardent contentions, while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not only was unable to accept his system as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy and to supplant with it the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> system, but was finally <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to reject it as unsound.

<p>Among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars G&uuml;nther's speculative system occasioned a far-reaching movement. Though he never held a position as professor, he gathered about him through his writings a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of enthusiastic, and in some instances distinguished, followers, who, on the other hand, were opposed by eminent <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. At its zenith the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was powerful enough to secure the appointment of some of its members to academic professorships in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> philosophy. G&uuml;nther himself was offered professorships at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, Bonn, <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, and T&uuml;bingen; he refused these because he hoped for a like offer from <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, but his expectation was never realized. In 1833 he received from <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> an honorary degree of Doctor of Theology, and a similar degree in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> was conferred on him by the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">University of Prague</a> in 1848. His earliest friends and collaborators were: the physician, Johann Heinrich Pabst (d. 1838, author of "Der Mensch und seine Geschichte", <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1830; 2nd ed., 1847; "Gibt es eine Philosophie des positiven Christenthums?" Cologne, 1832; "Adam und Christus.

Other prominent adherents of G&uuml;nther were: Johann Heinrich L&ouml;we (professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, 1839-51; at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, 1851); Johann Nepomuk Ehrlich (d. 1864; from 1836 taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in Krems; in 1850 became professor of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/06733d.htm">Graz</a>, in 1852 at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, where in 1856 he became professor of fundamental <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>); Jakob Zukrigl (d. 1876; professor of <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> and philosophy at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, 1848); Xaver Schmid (d. 1883; in 1856 he became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>); Jakob Merten (d. 1872); professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, 1845-68); Karl Werner (d. 1888; professor at St. P&ouml;lten, 1847; at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1870); Theodor Gangauf, O.S.B. (d. 1875; professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, 1841-75, and simultaneously, 1851-59, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Stephen's at the same place); Johann Sp&ouml;rlein (d. 1873; from 1849 professor at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>); Georg Karl Mayer (d. 1868; from 1842 professor at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>); Peter Knoodt (d. 1889; from 1845 professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>); Peter Joseph Elvenich (d. 1886; from 1829 professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, at first a <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermesian</a> and later a disciple of G&uuml;nther); Johann Baptist Baltzer (d. 1871; from 1830 professor of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, originally a <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermesian</a>); Joseph Hubert Reinkens (d. 1896; from 1853 professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>; from 1873 Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>). Finally, in a younger generation, the most distinguished advocates of the system were pupils of Knoodt, Theodor Weber (d. 1906; professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, 1872-90; from 1890 <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> under Reinkens at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, and from 1896 Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in that city), whose "Metaphysik" (2 vols., Gotha, 1888-91), containing an independent reconstruction of G&uuml;nther's speculation, is on the whole the most important work of the G&uuml;ntherian School, and Ernst Melzer (d. in 1899 at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>).

<p>Among the literary opponents of G&uuml;nther's philosophy the following deserve mention: Johann Hast, Wenzeslaus Mattes, P. Volkmuth, P. Ildephons Sorg, O.S.B., Johann Nepomuk Oischinger, <a href="../cathen/04786c.htm">Franz Xaver Dieringer</a>, Franz Jakob Clemens, Friedrich Michelis, Johann Adam Hitzfelder, <a href="../cathen/08667a.htm">Joseph Kleutgen</a>, Johannes Katshthaler.

<p>The Congregation of the Index in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> began in 1852 an investigation of G&uuml;nther's doctrines and writings, G&uuml;nther being invited to appear personally or to send some of his disciples to represent him. This mission was entrusted to Baltzer and Gangauf who arrived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in November, 1853. Gangauf was replaced by Knoodt in the summer of 1854. The latter and Baltzer laboured together until the end of November in that year, when they submitted their written defence to the Congregation of the Index and returned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. These efforts, however, and the favourable intervention of friends in high station failed to avert the final blow, though they served to defer it for a time. Cardinals Schwarzenberg and <a href="../cathen/04786b.htm">Diepenbrock</a>, and Bishop Arnoldi of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, were friendly to G&uuml;nther and assisted him at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Even the head of the Congregation of the Index, Cardinal d'Andrea, was well-disposed towards him. On the other hand, Cardinals von Geissel, <a href="../cathen/12660b.htm">Rauscher</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12730c.htm">Reisach</a> urged his condemnation. The Congregation, by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 8 January, 1857, placed the works of G&uuml;nther on the Index. The special grounds of this condemnation were set forth by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> addressed by him to Cardinal von Geissel, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, on 15 June, 1857, which declares that G&uuml;nther's teachings on the Trinity, the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the nature of man, the Creation, and particularly his views on the relation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as well as the fundamental <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, which is the controlling factor of his philosophy even in the handling of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, are not consistent with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Before the publication of the Index <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, G&uuml;nther had been summoned to submit thereto, and in fact had declared his acquiescence, but for him internal submission and rejection of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> was out of the question. He felt keenly the blow, which he looked upon as an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and which embittered him; but subsequently he published nothing. Some of his followers, like Merten, now turned away from G&uuml;ntherianism, but the greater number held to it obstinately, and for many years it found academic support at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> (through Knoodt) and at <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> (through Elvenich and Weber). After the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> most of the G&uuml;ntherians named above who were still living at the time (with the exception of <a href="../cathen/15322b.htm">Veith</a>) joined the Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement, in which some of them assumed leading parts. Their hopes of thus imparting new vigour to G&uuml;ntherianism were not realized, whereas, by their separation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they brought about the final elimination of G&uuml;ntherian influence from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> thought.
