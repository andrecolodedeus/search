<h1>Anton Martin Slomsek </h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09049a.htm">Lavant</a>, in Maribor, <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, noted Slovenian educator, born 1800; died 24 Sept., 1862. The dawn of the nineteenth century found the Slovenian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in a precarious condition; their number was pitifully small, and the courses they offered were inadequate and unsatisfactory. This deplorable state was due to the fact that the Austrian officials endeavoured to suppress the national language, and, to compass this end, introduced foreign teachers thoroughly distasteful to the people, whom in turn they despised. Moreover, books, magazines, papers, and other <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> influences were lacking, not because they would not have been gladly welcomed, but because they were forbidden by the Government in its fear of Panslavism. This situation Bishop Slomsek was compelled to face. A man of initiative and discernment, the changes he wrought in a short time were wonderful. In the Constitution of 1848, granting national <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> long denied, he found his instrument. Following this measure, though only after many futile attempts, he received official sanction to undertake the reform of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first fruits</a> of his labours were a series of excellent text-books, many from his own pen, which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> powerful factors in the growth and development of religious as well as national <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The founding of the weekly, "Drobtinice" (Crumbs), was his next step. Essays and books on a great variety of subjects, embracing practically every question on which his countrymen stood in need of enlightenment, were published in quick succession, and his vigorous and incisive style, well adapted to the intelligence of his readers, though not lacking scholarly refinement, made his works exceedingly popular. His pastorals and sermons constitute a literature of lasting value. In 1841 he sought to realize a dream of years &mdash; the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the spread of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature. Unfortunately, the movement was branded as Panslavistic, and failed at the time; but ten years later this organization was effected, and <em>Druzba sv. Mohora</em> began sending a few instructive books to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> homes. Today, a million <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> volumes have been distributed among a million and a half of people.

<p>Although Slomsek was ardent and active in the interests of his own race, yet he was admired and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by great men of other nations, and his kindness and tact eliminated all bitterness from the controversies in which he was forced to engage. Patriotism, the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his people. their temporal and spiritual welfare, were his inspiring motives, as the non-Catholic Makusev remarks: "Education, based on religion and nationality, was his lofty aim". Humility and childlike simplicity marked his life. His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, sincerely devoted to him, frequently heard him repeat the words: "When I was born, my mother laid me on a bed of straw, and I desire no better pallet when I die, asking only to be in the state of grace and worthy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>".
