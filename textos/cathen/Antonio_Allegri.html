<h1>Antonio Allegri</h1>  

<p>Born in Correggio, a small Lombard town near <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, 1494; died 5 March, 1534. His name in history is that of his birthplace, but he is often called "The Master of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>". Following the custom of the time he latinized his name and signed himself Antonius Laetus. Details in the life of this great master are meagre. Even in 1542 <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> found no traces of him, no sketch or portrait of him in all <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. Correggio left no writings, had no teachers, no pupils, visited no great art centres, made no acquaintance with his contemporaries, and never sued the favour of the mighty. His father, it is said, was a small, well-to-do merchant, a good, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> citizen who gave his son an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and the opportunity to become the great artist he proved to be. An uncle "who <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> but was no artist" (Dr. Meyer*) had no influence on Correggio's artistic life. From 1518 to 1530 he lived chiefly in <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>. In 1519 he married Girolama Francesca di Braghetis, of Correggio, who died in 1529. The next year the artist returned to his native town, where, during the next five years, he lived a simple, devout and contented life. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. He left a son, Pomponio, an obscure artist; and the Allegri <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> soon became extinct. Correggio's genius unfolded itself in his native village; his few patrons were at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, and his only <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was the lay Brotherhood of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. He ranks with the greatest Italian masters, although some authorities incline to place him at the head of the Decadent or "Sweet" School of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. The early works of Correggio are "in the style of the <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrarese</a> School" (Jean Paul Richter); and later he was slightly influenced by <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Mantegna</a> and <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Da Vinci</a>. But his mature style is peculiar to himself and the principles of this art prevailed in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries over all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Then there was a School of Correggio, and he had a host of imitators.

<p>Correggio is the most skillful artist since the ancient Greeks in the art of foreshortening; and, indeed, he was master of every technical device in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, being the first to introduce the rules of aerial perspective. Radiant light floods his pictures and is so delicately graded that it passes subtly into shade with that play of reflections among the shadows which gave transparency in every modulation. This is chiaroscuro. Even in Allegri's earliest works it was prominent, and later he became the acknowledged master of it. His refined feeling made Correggio <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the nude as though from a vision of ideal beauty; the sensuous in life he made pure and beautiful; earthly pleasures he spiritualized, and gave expression to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> beauty, the very culmination of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Art. His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> pictures are a cry of "Sursum Corda!" The age in which he lived and worked was partly responsible for this; but his modesty, his retiring disposition, his fondness for solitude, his ideal home- life, his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> contributed far more to it. Correggio's early works are simple and na&iuml;ve; later, in some of his church frescoes, he is more conventional; but he always possessed a wondrous grasp of figures in perspective <em>di sotto in su</em>, and gave to them unparalleled movement and grace. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> whose smile was that of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> human <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and pictured men in "sublime bliss and in the extremity of great joyousness" (Richter).

<p>Among Correggio's greatest works are the noble frescoes in the church of St. Paolo, which rank with the best decorations done in the height of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, though consigned to oblivion for two centuries; the frescoes in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John; and in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> &mdash; all of them in <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>. On seeing these frescoes <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a> exclaimed: "Were I not <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a> I should wish to be Correggio." His easel pictures are in every great <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> gallery. Dresden possesses "The Reading Magdalen", "The Nativity", called "Die heilige Nicht" (the Holy Night), and three Madonnas. In the "Nativity" the light is made to radiate from the Holy Child and illuminate all the other figures and the whole of the picture, a wholly new proceeding in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and original with Correggio. Concerning the "Reading Magdalen", one of the most popular and most frequently copied pictures in the world, the prevailing <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> among the critics is that it is not by Correggio. Morelli says: "It is most likely a <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> work. It is <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> on copper, and no Italian artist used copper before the close of the sixteenth century. Director Julius Meyer* has already pronounced this picture spurious" [cf. "Italian masters in German Galleries" (London, 1833), 129-136]. The "Virgin Adoring the Infant Christ" (Uffizi) is an exquisite poem of motherhood, full of all that is tender and sweet in human sentiment. Other celebrated masterpieces are "The marriage of Saint Catherine" (Louvre); "Madonna in Glory" (Munich); "Danae" (Rome); "Madonna 'del Latte'" (St. Petersburg); "Ecce Homo", "Madonna della Cesta", and "Vierge au Panier" (National Gallery); "Madonna and Holy Infant," called "Il Giorno" (Parma); "Noli me tangere" (Madrid); "Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane" (Apsley House, London); and the "Madonna del Coniglio," or "the Zingarella" (Naples).
