<h1>Antonio Vieira</h1>  

<p>Missionary, diplomat, orator, b. at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 6 February, 1608; d. at <a href="../cathen/13466a.htm">Bahia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, 18 July, 1697. Brought when a child to Bahia, he studied under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1623, pronouncing his first <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in 1625. At eighteen he was teaching rhetoric, and shortly after writing commentaries on the "Canticle of Canticles", the tragedies of Seneca, and the "Metamorphoses" of Ovid. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1635, he immediately astounded all by his eloquence. When the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> besieged Bahia (1640), he delivered his "Discourse for the Success of the Portuguese Arms", called by the sceptical Raynal the most extraordinary outburst of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> eloquence. <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, under John IV, had thrown off the Spanish yoke in 1640. The following year Vieira went to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> with young Mascarenhas, whom the viceroy had commissioned to assure the new king of the loyalty of the colonists. John, recognizing the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit's</a> merit, made him tutor to the Infante Dom Pedro, court preacher, and a member of the Royal Council. Vieira did efficient work in the War and Navy Departments, revived commerce, urged the foundation of a national bank and the organization of the <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazilian</a> Trade Company. A champion of freedom, he maintained that no citizen should be exempt from taxation, and denounced the severity of the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. He advocated a purely defensive <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and to his skilful plans are partly due the victories on Elvas, Almeixal, Castello-Rodrigo, and Montes-Claros.

<p>At different periods (1646, 1647, 1650) John IV sent Vieira on diplomatic missions, to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">The Hague</a>, London, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> little relished such honours, and steadily refused the official title of ambassador and the offer of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. In 1652 he returned to Maranh&acirc;o. But so fearless were his denunciations of the slave owners and their excesses that in 1654 he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, where he pleaded the cause of the outraged Indians. He was successful, and sailed for <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> in 1655. Six years he worked for the Indians, translating the Catechism into their rude idioms, teaching them the arts of peace, travelling hundreds of miles on the Amazon and its tributaries, winning even the fierce Nheengaibas by his eloquence, but again arousing the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the slave owners, who in 1661 "exiled" him to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. The corrupt Alphonso VI had succeeded John IV, and Vieira found many enemies at Court. For his leniency to the converted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for alleged <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, for his ultra-patriotic "Sebastianism", and his too credulous acceptance of the prophecies of Bandarra, who foretold a millennium in which <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should rule the world, for his harmless, but extravagant, "As Esperan&ccedil;as do <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>" and "Clavis Prophetarum", he was condemned by the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, forbidden to preach, and kept a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> from Oct., 1665, to Dec., 1667. Under Pedro II the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> reversed it sentence. But <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was a safer residence, and from 1669 to 1675 he found there an enthusiastic welcome. <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, his general, the great preacher Oliva, that erratic princess Christine of Sweden, who vainly begged him to become her director, and high and low were fascinated by his eloquence. But Vieira, amid his triumphs, longed for his Indians of Maranhao, and after a brief stay in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> sailed for South America in 1681. Trial and tribulation again faced him. Worn out by his labours as preacher, superior, and visitor of the missions, <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderously</a> accused of conniving at the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of a colonial official, denounced to his superiors for illegal canvassing in a provincial congregation of his order, and cleared of the charge only when in his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a>, he died, sorrowing, but unbroken, in his ninetieth year. The slaves and the poor were his chief mourners.

<p>Vieira is one of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal's</a> greatest figures in the seventeenth century. Southey (History of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>) calls him one of the greatest statesmen of his country. A thorough-going <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Vieira was also a progressive administrator with large and democratic views. His character, though streaked with a vein of extravagance, was of the noblest. He had lofty conceptions, and, in their execution, was independent and bold. In the midst of courts, he remained <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and mortified. He had one dream, to see <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the standard- bearer of civilization and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the old and new world. As a prose writer he is perhaps the greatest <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> has produced. As an orator he is undoubtedly one of the world's masters, equally great in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and the rude shrines of Maranhao. He is not free from the bad taste and artificial "gongorism" imported from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, but he is clear, popular, and practical, profoundly original and frequently sublime. In this respect he does not suffer by comparison with <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> himself. He has variety, <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> skill, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginative</a> colouring, pathos, power, and even humour. He is amazingly fertile; he has, for instance, 30 sermons on the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, 18 on Saint Francis Xavier, 14 on the Eucharist. He had mastered the Scriptures, and his interpretations, if forced at times, are always striking. Vieira's works have been frequently published, as for example, "Obras Completas" (Lisbon, 1854), fairly complete with 15 volumes of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> alone, 500 letters, etc.; this edition, however, omits many <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> kept in the British Museum and the National Library, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; "Obras Completas" (Porto, 1907); "Serm&otilde;es Selectos" (6 vols., 1852-53); "Cartas" (3 vols., Lisbon, 1735). For a complete list of Sommervogel and Cabral's fine work, "Vieira Pregador".
