<h1>Antonio and Piero Benci Pollajuolo</h1>  

<p>Antonio and Piero Benci Pollajuolo derived their surname, according to Florentine custom, from the trade of their father, who was a dealer in poultry. Both were born at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, Antonio about 1432, Piero in 1443; both died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the younger in 1496. the elder in 1498, and both were buried in the same <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in San Pietro in Vincoli. Antonio studied <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> under <a href="../cathen/15117c.htm">Uccello</a>, and was influenced by <a href="../cathen/02219c.htm">Baldovinetti</a>. Among his individual <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> are: "David" (Berlin Museum); "Fight of Hercules with Ant&aelig;us", "Fight of Hercules with the Hydra", two small panels (Uffizi); "Hercules and Nessus" (Jarves collection, New Haven, Conn.); "Communion of Mary Magdalen" (Pieve de Staggia, near Poggibonsi). The collaboration of the brothers began in 1465. Piero, brought up in his brother's studio, received lessons from <a href="../cathen/03407d.htm">Castagno</a>, <a href="../cathen/15117c.htm">Uccello</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02219c.htm">Baldovinetti</a>. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the altar piece representing "Sts. James, Vincent, and Eustachius" (Uffizi); "Tobias and the Angel" (Museum of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>); and the "Annunciation" (Museum of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>). Both brothers drew designs depicting the life of St. John the Baptist, from which were made the <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroideries</a> for the San Giovanni <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> (Museum of the Duomo, Florence). In 1475 they finished the altar piece representing the "Martyrdom of St. Sebastian" (National Gallery, London).

<p>The Pollajuoli were likewise portrait <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of renown, but these works have nearly all perished. The portrait of the wife of Giovanni Bardi (Museum Poldi-Pezzoli, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>) has been ascribed to Antonio. To Piero are credited: the "Galeazzo Sforza" (Uffizi), six of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> "Virtues" (Mercanzia of Florence, 1469), sitting in marble niches, with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> ornamentation, and characterized by nobility and gravity, and the "Coronation of the Virgin" (Church of San Gimignano 1483), a mediocre altar piece.

<p>Antonio was chiefly a goldsmith and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>. As a goldsmith he worked in the studio of <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a>. His two masterpieces in the Baptistery are the <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-relief</a> of the "Nativity" (Museum of the Duomo), and the large silver cross which he executed in collaboration with Betto di Francesco Betti. As a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> he was the pupil of <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a> and excelled in the treatment of bronze. He executed the small group of "Hercules and Cacus", several busts, and (1493) the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, ordered by <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>. This magnificent bronze <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> is in St. Peter's, in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. The head is a remarkable portrait, made from a cast and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>, on which Antonio expended all the delicacy of his talent as a goldsmith. At the sides the liberal and prospective arts are represented as half-nude <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, refined and elegant, but <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>. The monument to <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> at St. Peter's was also executed by Pollajuolo. In the lower part the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is represented as dead, while above he is depicted as in life, seated on his throne and giving his blessing. The ornamental <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> figures of Virtues are charming but profane. Antonio Pollajuolo also carried his passion for <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a> and the male nude into <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, even in religious pictures such as the "Martyrdom of St. Sebastian", where it is quite offensive. He was "the first of those great <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> artists of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> for whom the human form, living or dead, and the study of <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a> and the nude became the sole aim and irresistible passion" (A. P&eacute;rat&eacute;).
