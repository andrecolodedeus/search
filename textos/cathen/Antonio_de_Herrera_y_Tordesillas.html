<h1>Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> historian; born at Cuellar, in the province of <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, in 1559; died at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 27 March, 1625. He was a great-grandson of the Tordesillas who was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the Comuneros at Seville. He studied in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and became secretary to Vespasiano Gonzaga, a brother of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, who was afterwards Viceroy of Navarre and Valencia, and who recommended him to Philip II in the last year of that monarch's reign. Philip appointed him grand historiographer (<em>cronista mayor</em>) of America and Castile, and he filled that office during part of his royal patron's reign, the whole reign of Philip III, and the beginning of that of Philip IV. At his death his body was conveyed to Cuellar, and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the church of Santa Marina, where his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> is still to be seen.

<p>His most famous work is the "Historia General de los Hechos de los Castellanos en las Islas y Tierra Firme del Mar Oc&eacute;ano" (General History of the deeds of the Castilians on the Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea), divided into eight periods of ten years each, and comprising all the years from 1472 to 1554. This work was printed at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1601; reprinted by Juan de la Cuesta in 1615; revised and augmented by Andr&eacute;s Gonz&aacute;lez* and published at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> by Nicolas Rodr&iacute;guez in 1726, and at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, by Juan Bautista Verdussen, in 1728. Worthy of note is the "Description of the West Indies", in the first volume of his work, which was translated into Latin and published at <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, by Gaspar Barleo, in 1622, a French version being published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in the same year. In 1660 there appeared a French translation of the first three decades of his "Historia" by Nicol&aacute;s de la Corte. In writing his great work Tordesillas made use of all the public archives, having access to documents of every kind. It is evident in his writings that he had to deal with a large number of historical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and contented himself with relating events as he found them recorded. A great part of his work is more or less a transcript of the History of the Indies left by the famous <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Bishop Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas</a>, though expurgated of wellnigh everything unfavourable to the settlers. A painstaking and conscientious investigator for the most part, his style does not correspond to his other admirable qualifications. He was a learned and judicious man, though, particularly in the later decades, somewhat prone to overpraise the conquerors and their exploits.

<p>In addition to that already mentioned, his most important works are: "A General History of the World during the time of Philip II from the year 1559 to the King's death"; "Events in Scotland and England during the forty-four years of the lifetime of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland" (Historia de lo sucedido en Escocia &eacute; Inglaterra en los cuarenta y cuatro a&ntilde;os que vivi&oacute; Maria Estuardo Reina de Escocia); Five books of the history of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and the conquests of the <a href="../cathen/02168a.htm">Azores</a> in the years 1582, 1583; "History of events in France from 1585 to 1594" (a work published in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1598, but suppressed by command of the king); "A Treatise, Relation, and Historical Discourse on the Disturbances in Aragon in the years 1591 and 1592" (Tratado, relaci&oacute;n y discurso hist&oacute;rico de los movimientos en <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> en los a&ntilde;os de 1591 y 1592); "Commentary on the deeds of the Spaniards, French, and Venetians in Italy, and of other Republics, Potentates, famous Italian Princes and Captains, from 1281 to 1559"; "Chronicle of the Turks, following chiefly that written by Juan Maria Vicentino, chronicler to Mahomet, Bajazet, and Suleiman, their lords" (unpublished); various works translated from the French and Italian, preserved in the National Library at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>.
