<h1>Antonio de Ulloa</h1>  

<p>Naval officer and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientist</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 12 Jan., 1716; died near <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 5 July, 1795. He entered the navy in 1733. In 1735 he was appointed with Jorge Juan, another young <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, a member of a scientific expedition which the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> of Sciences was sending to <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> to measure a degree of the meridian at the equator. They remained there for nearly ten years. In 1745, having finished their scientific labours, he and Jorge Juan prepared to return to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, agreeing to travel on different ships in order to minimize the danger of losing the important fruits of their labours. The ship upon which Ulloa was travelling was captured by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a>, and he was taken as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In that country, through his scientific attainments, he gained the friendship of the men of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. In a short time, through the influence of the president of this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, he was released and was able to return to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He became prominent as a scientist and was appointed to serve on various important scientific commissions. In 1766 he was sent as Governor to "La Florida Occidental" (Louisiana), where he remained two years, and in 1779 he became lieutenant-general of the naval forces. He is to be credited with the establishment of the first museum of natural history, the first <a href="../cathen/10218a.htm">metallurgical</a> laboratory in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the observatory of <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz</a>. As a result of his scientific work in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, he published (Madrid, 1784) "Relaci&oacute;n hist&oacute;rica del viaje &aacute; la Am&eacute;rica Meridional", which contains a full, accurate, and clear description of the greater part of South America geographically, and of its inhabitants and natural history. In collaboration with the Jorge Juan mentioned above, he also wrote "Noticias secretas de Am&eacute;rica", giving valuable information regarding the early <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in Spanish America. This work was published by David Barry in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 1826.
