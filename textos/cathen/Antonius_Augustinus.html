<h1>Antonius Augustinus</h1>  

<p>Historian of canon law and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, born at Saragossa 26 February, 1517, of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, 31 May, 1586. After finishing his studies at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> and Salamanca, he went to Bologna (1536), to Padua (1537), and to Florence (1538) in which latter place he examined the famous "Codex Florentinus" of the <a href="../cathen/11439a.htm">Pandects</a> and made the acquaintance of such learned men of the new historical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> as <a href="../cathen/01273b.htm">Andrea Alciati</a>, to whom he owed a confirmation of his pronounced bent towards a positive and critical treatment of the ancient materials of canonical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. In 1541 he took his degree of Doctor of Civil and Canon Law and in 1544, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, he was made Auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>. In 1555 he was sent by <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, with a message of congratulation for <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> and as Counsellor to <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>. In 1056 he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01312a.htm">Alife</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, and in 1561 was transferred to L&eacute;rida in his native <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He assisted during three years at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and urged ardently the reformation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. "It is our fault", he said in the council, "that so great an agitation has arisen in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. We must begin with the reformation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It is your business, O Fathers, to save by your decrees the common weal of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that is now threatened." In 1576 he was promoted by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">archiepiscopal see of Tarragona</a>.

<p>Augustinus is one of the foremost figures of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> that set in with so much vigour and success in the latter half of the sixteenth century. His chosen field was the fontes, or original sources of ecclesiastical law both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a>. The basis of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> canon law was the "Decretum" of Gratian, a useful codification of the middle of the twelfth century, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> law-book of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, of great academic authority, but never formally approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as church legislation. Its materials, never hitherto critically illustrated as to their prominence and form, and often badly corrupted as to their text, stood in need of judicious sifting and elucidation. It was to this task that the young Augustinus addressed himself from 1538 to l 543. In the latter year he published at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> the first critical study on Gratian, "Emendationum et Opinionum libri IV" the result of four years' labour at the text of the old <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> of Bologna. This text remained his life-long study; towards the close of his career, after important services rendered during ten years to the "Correctores Romani" in their edition of Gratian (Rome, 1582), he finished his own magisterial examination of the work; it was not, however, published until after his death, "De Emendatione Gratiani dialogi (30) libri II" (Tarragona, 1587).

<p>Other important publications of the sources of civil and ecclesiastical law occupied his pen. Thus he published in 1567 an edition of the Byzantine imperial constitutions in 1576 his "IV antiquae Collectiones Decretalium", in 1582 a treatise on the "P&oelig;nitentiale Romanum" discovered by him. From 1557 he sought earnestly for the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> patronage, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> or regal, to enable him to publish the hitherto unedited Greek text of the ancient <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> councils, and for that purpose examined many archives in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the fruits of his labours were reaped at a later date by others. Among the more valuable of his posthumous publications, and appealing strongly to modern historical tastes, is a critical examination of several early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> collections of canon law that served as original material for the "Decretum" of Gratian. This work, that <a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a> and <a href="../cathen/13528a.htm">von Scherer</a> speak of with respect, is entitled "De quibusdam veteribus Canonum Ecclesiasticorum Collectionibus Judicium et censura", and was published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1611) with the second and third parts of his "Juris Pontificii Veteris Epitome" (to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, 1198-1216), the first part of which appeared at <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> in 1587. It contains biographical and text-critical notes on a number of collectors of ecclesiastical laws, from the sixth to the fact that the books were themselves in many century. In this work he treats progressively of the pseudo-Isidorian <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, and while he did not dispose of sufficient material to demonstrate thoroughly their spurious character or to attempt to fix the time and place of their compilation, it is clear that he did not believe them earlier than the time of Pope Damasus (366-384) or even of the seventh century "Collectio Hispana". His notes on the correlated "Capitula Hadriani" (Angilramni) were published at Cologne in 1618. His powerful genius was truly universal. Classical philology, epigraphy, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a>, above all the history of civil and ecclesiastical law found in him an investigator whose boldness and insight where extraordinary for that period of incipient historico-critical research. Death surprised him at the patriotic task of an edition of the works of the Spanish writer, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a>. The works of Augustinus were printed in eight volumes at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> (1775-74); his life by Siscarius is in the second volume 1-121.
