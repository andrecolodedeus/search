<h1>Antonius Possevinus</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal envoy</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> in 1533 or 1534; d. at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, 26 Feb., 1611. At sixteen he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to study, familiarized himself with many languages, and became secretary to <a href="../cathen/06635a.htm">Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga</a>. In 1559 he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and in 1560 was sent to preach against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. Passing on to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1561, and preached at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a>, <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, and elsewhere, converting many <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>. He became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the colleges of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and Lyons, and in 1573 was secretary to the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, Everardo Mercuriano. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> himself was among those who learned to appreciate his merit while he occupied the last-named position. When John III of Sweden expressed his desire to become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in 1577, made Possevinus his special <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to that court, and Possevinus also had to negotiate with the courts of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> to secure support for John in the event of political complications. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> envoy, attired as a secular, was received with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, and the king made his profession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>.

<p>Many difficulties arose when measures for the conversion of Sweden were debated. Possevinus returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with proposals, some of which were judged inadmissible. Through his constant efforts several colleges (the German College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, those of Braunsberg, <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>, <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, and others) received <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> youth, with the object of forming a national <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. At the close of 1578 he returned to Sweden as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Scandinavia. On his way, he again visited the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and the emperor. Disconcerted by the refusal of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to accept the king's terms, and thwarted by sectarians, who had the advantage in numbers and influence, Possevinus could do nothing but comfort and encourage the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> remaining in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. He displayed the greatest devotion on the occasion of an epidemic, when the sick were left helpless by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>.

<p>In 1580 he turned in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the meantime the Tsar Ivan IV sought the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> mediation with Stephen B&aacute;thori, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, in the cause of peace. Possevinus was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> (1581) to negotiate the re-union of the Russian Church with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The negotiations made with the Russian envoys in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> nugatory, as the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> insisted on profiting by his successes in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and Possevinus went to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> to treat with the Tsar. He wisely laid down as preliminary conditions of peace with <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> the liberty of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship for foreigners in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and free passage for pontifical <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. These were granted <em>pro forma</em>. His overtures of reconciliation with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were met only with reassuring words. In 1582 the Tsar signed a treaty of peace, compelled by Polish victories. Possevinus left <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> laden with honours but not deceived as to the success of his efforts: Ivan the Terrible had negotiated with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> only to mislead both <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Having returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Possevinus was immediately sent back to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, to induce the king to combat <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in Livonia and <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. He himself visited these countries, preaching and arguing with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.

<p>At the Diet of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, in 1583, he obtained the passage of resolutions favourable to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. His efforts were ineffectual in the treaties between <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and the emperor, on which business he went twice to the Court of Rudolph II. He still stayed in the North, preaching in Livonia, <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, writing treatises against the innovators and distributing books on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. He did much towards the reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, and had a large share in the founding of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>. He also wrote treatises against the adversaries of the re-union. Through his exertions the Collegium Hosianum of Braunsberg was enlarged for the reception of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedes</a> and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>; at <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a> and Claudiopolis, in <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, colleges were established for similar purposes. In 1587 he was invited to teach <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, where he remained for four years. Among his disciples there was St. Francis of Sales. Returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he devoted his time to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, historical, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies. Having played an important role in the recognition of Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he was expelled from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the Spanish party. He then made extended tours to visit the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in quest of books, as on former occasions, in which task he was generously aided by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>.

<p>Antonio Possevinus represented the literary, scientific, and diplomatic type of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, performing important political missions, establishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and letters, and applying himself to diplomatic protocols and classical authors with equal assiduity. Had he not met with insurmountable difficulties in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and in negotiating the treaties between <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and the empire, he would have left a still deeper trace on the political <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. His writings include "Moscovia" (Vilna, 1586), an important authority on Russian history; "Dell sacrificia della Messa" followed by an appendix, "Riposta a P. Vireto" (Lyons, 1563); "Il soldato cristiano" (Rome, 1569); "Not&aelig; verbi Dei et Apostolic&aelig; Ecclesi&aelig;" (Posen, 1586). His most celebrated works are the "Apparatus sacer ad Scripturum veteris et Novi Test." (Venice, 1603-06), where he records and analyses more than 8,000 books dealing with sacred Scripture; and the "Bibliotheca Selecta" (Rome, 1593), treating of the method of study, teaching, and practical use of various <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>; the second part contains a critical bibliography of various <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. (Several chapters of this book have been published separately.) Parts of his letters were published by A. M. Gratianus Borgo in "De scriptis ab Ant. Possevino ad Aloysnium fratrem litteris" (Florence, 1645-46).
