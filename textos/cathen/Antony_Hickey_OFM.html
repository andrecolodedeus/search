<h1>Antony Hickey, O.F.M.</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born in the Barony of Islands, Co. Clare, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1586; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 26 June, 1641. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in his native place, entered the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of St. Antony at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, which had just been founded as a refuge for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> students, and received the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> habit on 1 November, 1607. Among his teachers at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> were the celebrated <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholars <a href="../cathen/15550a.htm">Hugh Mac an Bhaird (Ward)</a> and Hugh Mac Caghwell, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, Father Antony was appointed lecturer in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and subsequently professor in the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of St. Francis at Cologne. In 1619 he was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to collaborate with <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Father Luke Wadding</a> in preparing for publication the Annals of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> and the works of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>. He lived for some time at S. Pietro in Montorio on the Janiculum and, from 1624 till his death, in the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of St. Isidore. During the discussions which were held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Immaculate Conception, Father Hickey won distinction by his learning and acuteness. His treatise on this subject is called by Marracius (Bibliotheca Mariana) "opus insigne et absolutum". In his work on the Fourth Book of Sentences, he shows great breadth of view and critical perception; in addition to the scholastic method, he makes use of the historical method and fully recognizes the development of sacramental <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. He took an active part in the labours of the commissions appointed by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> to revise the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, and to examine into the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>. At the general chapter of the order held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1639, he was elected definitor general.

<p>Hickey wrote "Commentarii in Lib. IV Sententiarum" (Lyons, 1639), "Nitela Franciscan&aelig; Religionis" (Lyons, 1627), in this book he refutes the aspersions cast on the early history of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> by Abraham Bzovius; "De Conceptione Immaculata B. Mari&aelig; Virginis"; "De Stigmatibus S. Catharin&aelig; Senensis", written by order of the Sacred Congregation of Rites; "Ad pleraque dubia moralia, et ascetica, gravissim&aelig; responsiones". This work, which <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> calls "opus doctissimum", is still in Manuscript. Among the Manuscripts preserved in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Convent, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, are several letters written to Father Hickey from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> on the civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs of that country. There is also an important letter of his on the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> language. Many of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> consulted him on matters of grave moment. His acquaintance with the history, language, and antiquities of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was extensive, and in co-operation with <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">John Colgan</a>, <a href="../cathen/15550a.htm">Hugh Ward</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholars, he drew up a plan for a critical history of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in all its branches, &mdash; but this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was not realized.
