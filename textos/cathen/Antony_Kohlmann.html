<h1>Antony Kohlmann</h1>  

<p>Educator and missionary, b. 13 July, 1771, at Kaiserberg, Alsace; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 11 April, 1836. He is to be ranked among the lights of the restored <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and among its most distinguished members in America, where he spent nearly a quarter of a century of his laborious life. At an early age he was compelled by the troubles of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> to go to live in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, where at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Fribourg he completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Soon after, in 1796, he joined the Congregation of the Fathers of the Sacred Heart. With them he laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for two years in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as a military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. From <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he was sent to Dillingen in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, as director of an <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>, then to <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, and next to Amsterdam to direct a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> established by the Fathers of the Faith of Jesus, with whom the Congregation of the Sacred Heart had united (11 April, 1799). The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> having been recognized (1801) by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a>, Father Kohlmann joined it and entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Dun&eacute;bourg on 21 June, 1803. A year later, in response to a call for additional workers in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> he was sent to Georgetown, D.C., where he was made assistant to the master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and went on missionary tours to the several German congregations in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>.

<p>Affairs in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in New York having gone badly, Bishop Carroll picked him out as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> best qualified to introduce the needed reforms and to restore order, and with his fellow <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Benedict Fenwick and four scholastics, James Wallace, Michael White, James Redmond, and Adam Marshall, he took charge there in October, 1808. It was a time of great commercial depression in the city owing to the results of the Embargo Act of 22 December, 1807. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, he states in a letter written on 8 November, 1808, consisted "of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, some hundreds of French and as many Germans; in all according to the common estimation of 14,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>". Such progress was made under his direction that the cornerstone of a new church, old St. Patrick's Cathedral, the second church erected in New York City, was laid on 8 June, 1809. He started a classical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> called the New York Literary Institution, which he carried on successfully for several years in what was then a suburban village but is now the site of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. In April, 1812, he also started a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls in the same neighbourhood, in charge of <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who came at his instance for that purpose from their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.

<p>About the same time Father Kohlmann became the central figure in a lawsuit that excited national interest. He had been instrumental in having <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> goods restored to a man, who demanded in court that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should reveal from whom he had received them. Father Kohlmann refused to do this, on the ground that his information had been received under the <a href="../cathen/13649b.htm">seal of confession</a>. The case was taken before the Court of General Sessions, where after a trial the decision rendered by De Witt Clinton was given in his favour. Its principle was later embodied in the State law passed on 10 December, 1828, which enacted that "No minister of the Gospel or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of any denomination whatsoever shall be allowed to disclose any confession made to him in his professional character in the course of discipline enjoined by the rules or practices of such denomination." To a report of the case when published Father Kohlmann added an exposition of the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. (Sampson, "The Catholic Question in America", appendix, New York, 1813.) The book excited a long and vigorous controversy with a number of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and was followed in 1821 by another learned work, "Unitarianism, Theologically and Philosophically considered", in which Father Kohlmann replied to the assertions of Dr. Jared Sparks and other <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian</a> leaders.

<p>New York had no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as yet, the first appointed having died in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> before he reached his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and Father Kohlmann governed as administrator for several years. In 1815, expecting the early arrival of the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<a href="../cathen/04257a.htm">Connolly</a>), he returned to the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of his order at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, D. C., as master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and in 1817 became superior. In 1824, when <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> restored the Gregorian University to the direction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, Father Kohlmann was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to take the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, which he filled for five years. One of his pupils then was the subsequent <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>; another became later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and the first <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (<a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Paul Cullen</a>). <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> and <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> both held Father Kohlmann in the highest esteem, and had him attached as consultor to the staffs of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> and several of the important Congregations, including that of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, of Bishops and Regulars, and of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. The last part of his life he spent as a confessor in the church of the Ges&ugrave;, where during the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten season</a> of 1836 he overtaxed himself and brought on an attack of pneumonia that ended his career.
