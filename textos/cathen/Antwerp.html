<h1>Antwerp</h1>  

<p>(ANVERS, ANTVERPEN, Spanish AMBERES)

<p>A city of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, in the archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, situated on the Scheldt (Escaut), about sixty miles from the sea, at the confluence of the little river Schyn, once navigable. Its foundation was probably due to some wandering Teutonic tribe; the people were certainly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> from about the middle of the seventh century (Diercxsen, Antuerpia Christo nascens ab an. 641, etc., Antwerp, 1747-1773), as is seen by the famous <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that met with in its history as the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> virgin Dymphna, Eligius, Amandus and Willibrord. It was pillaged by the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> in 835, but soon arose from its ruins. In the tenth and eleventh centuries it appears as the capital of the Margraves of Antwerp, and from that time to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> recognized, through all political vicissitudes, no other source of authority in its various political masters. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the Dukes of Brabant favoured its development by many privileges, political and commercial. In the course of the fourteenth century the Counts of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> were its lords paramount and in the fifteenth it recognized the overlordship of the great house of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, through which relationship it eventually rose to its highest prosperity, when with the rest of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> inheritance it passed under the control of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> (1517-56). After his death there broke out a long series of sanguinary conflicts, partly religious and partly politico-commercial, resulting in the overthrow of Spanish and the substitution of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> domination (1599) whereby the southern or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> provinces of the Low Countries were enabled to preserve their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, though at a great price from a commercial standpoint. The latter quarter of the eighteenth century was marked by much unrest, owing to the anti-Catholic or <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronian</a> policy of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> (1765-90). During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> Antwerp was incorporated (1794) with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and was made by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> (1804-13) the chief naval fortress of his new empire. After his overthrow it was incorporated (1815) with the new kingdom of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, but cast in its fortunes with <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> during the revolution of 1830, and has risen since then to the position of a foremost centre of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> commerce and industry.
<h2>Population and commerce</h2>

<p>The population of Antwerp rose in the sixteenth century (1560) to the phenomenal figure of 200,000. It was then the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> of the continent, and owed its prosperity to various causes, among which may be mentioned the decay of earlier commercial centres like <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, consequent on the discoveries of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> and <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a>, and the natural deepening of the western entrance of the Scheldt. From the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it had inherited a growing trade in fish, salt, and oats, in English wool, and in exchanges of all kinds with the various states of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. But now commercial products came no longer by way of the Adriatic and over <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to the wharves of Antwerp, but directly by sea; this was especially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the merchandise of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. Merchants of every nation flooded to Antwerp; among them the agents of the Hanseatic League and of the merchant adventurers of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, it became the chief banking centre of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The rich Fuggers of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> had a house in Antwerp whence they loaned large sums to kings and cities. In those days, it is said, that a thousand vessels were at times anchored off the city, and one hundred came and went daily. Its fairs were no less famous than those of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> and Novgorod, and had been much frequented even in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a>, for purposes of barter. But this prosperity declined in the terrible politico-religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> of the last three decades of the sixteenth century, and was finally extinguished as a result of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> (1618-48). The Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, signed in the latter year, contained a clause in the interest of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, providing for the closing of free navigation on the Scheldt. Thereby was closed also the regular source of Antwerp's commercial and industrial greatness. It was not until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, or rather until 1863, that an unimpeded traffic was provided for on the broad, smooth-flowing river that rivals the Thames and the Hudson as a creator of national wealth.
<h2>Ecclesiastical development</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Antwerp was comprised within the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. But in 1559, at the instance of Philip II, a new arrangement of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> of the Low countries was made by <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, whereby three <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> and fourteen <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> were created, and all external <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, however ancient, abolished. Antwerp became one of the six suffragans of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, and remained such until the end of the eighteenth century. This step did not meet with the goodwill of the merchants of the city, who feared the introduction of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> and the costliness of an episcopal establishment, and urged the transfer of the new see to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, where it would be less offensive to the non-Catholic elements of their city. The new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines were already deeply rooted in the city and vicinity, and their representatives were of course the chief agents of the opposition, though certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> monastic interests were very active, being now called on by the Pope to provide for the support of the new see. Finally, the famous <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> <a href="../cathen/14142a.htm">Sonnius</a> (from Son in Brabant) was transferred from <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a> to Antwerp in 1569 as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new see, and governed it until his death in 1576. Ten years of religious and political conflict elapsed before another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could be appointed in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Livinus Torrentius (Van der Beke), a <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, graceful <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>, and diplomat. He died in 1595. The scholarly Miraeus (Le Mire) was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Antwerp from 1604 to 1611, and was succeeded in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by a series of fifteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the last of whom was Cornelius Nelis, librarian of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> University and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Antwerp from 1785 to his death in 1798. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> suppressed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> 29 Nov., 1801, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Qui Christi Domini vices." Its former <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> territory now belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Archdiocese of Mechlin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> portion to the <a href="../cathen/02752a.htm">Diocese of Breda</a> (Foppens, Historia Episcopatus Antuerpiensis, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 1717; Ram, Synopsis actorum eccl., Antwerp, Brussels, 1856). The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Antwerp were long very famous centres of its <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. In the twelfth century the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of St. Norbert (<a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>) founded the abbey of St. Michael, that became later one of the principal <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of the Low Countries, sheltered many royal guests, and eventually excited no little cupidity and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> by reason of its great wealth. The Cathedral of Antwerp was originally a small <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> shrine known familiarly as "Our Lady of the Stump." Many other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders found a shelter in Antwerp, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (1446), <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> (1494), <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> (1632), likewise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> branches of the same. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> had two great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, St. Sauveur, founded in 1451 by the devout merchant Peter Pot, and St. Bernard, about six miles from Antwerp, founded in 1233 (Papebroch, "Annales Antuerpienses," to the year 1600, ed. Mertens and Buchmann, Antwerp, 1846-48).


<h2>Religious conflicts</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> of Antwerp seems to have been troubled by only one notable <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, that of Tanchelin in the twelfth century. But the principles and doctrines of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> soon found sympathizers among the German, English, and other foreign merchants and also among the citizens. First the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> and then the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> field-preachers attacked with a fierce persistency the existing <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order. To the religious differences were added patriotic feelings and the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of Spanish domination. Popular passions, nursed from many sources, exploded in August, 1566, when the splendid <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> that had been 176 years in process of building was sacked by a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> mob, the seventy altars destroyed, and all the works of art it contained defaced or <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a>. Similar scenes occurred in all the other churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Antwerp. The next year <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> replied by the sending of the <a href="../cathen/01371a.htm">Duke of Alva</a>, one of the great military captains of the age, who inaugurated a reign of terror that bore with equal severity on <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, since it interfered with the trade of the city and vicinity by stopping the supply of English wool for the looms of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and by intensifying the religious and patriotic embitterment whose seeds had first been sown by the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>. Henceforth the history of Antwerp (ecclesiastical and civil) is intimately bound up with the story of the Gueux (Beggars) resistance to the policy of Philip II (1556-98). The sack of Antwerp by the mutinous Spanish troops (4 Nov., 1576), that French troops attempted to repeat (17 Jan., 1583), and the famous siege of the city by <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain's</a> great captain Alessandro Farnese, Duke of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, are among the darkest pages of the great city's pitiful story in the last decades of the sixteenth century. At a cruel price set rather by politics than by religion, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had been preserved in Antwerp, and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> domination excluded in favour of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rule. From 1599 to 1621 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> were governed by Albert, Archduke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and his spouse Isabella, daughter of Philip II. After the death of "the Archdukes," Spanish rule was once more made permanent in this "cockpit of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>" until 1714 when, as one result of the War of the Spanish Succession, the government of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> again fell to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>.
<h2>Intellectual life</h2>

<p>Amid religious and political conflict the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of Antwerp never flagged. The city is famous in the annals of printing. In 1492 Thierry Maertens printed at Antwerp, as a fly-sheet, a Latin translation of the letter of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> in which he announced his discovery of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, and in this way probably first made known the great event to the men of Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. But it is to Christopher Plantin (d. 1589), and his son-in-law and successor Moretus, that the city chiefly owes its fame as a centre of book-making and distribution. This "giant among printers" organized the trade on a basis hitherto unattempted, began and executed extraordinary enterprises, and founded a house that lasted during the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries in which period it enjoyed a monopoly of the sale of <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missals</a> and breviaries throughout the vast Spanish domains. It was the Plantin press that issued the first volume of the "Acta Sanctorum" (1643), an enterprise begun at Antwerp by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Heribert Rosweyde (d. 1629), organized there by his confrere John Bolland (see <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">BOLLANDISTS</a>) and conducted there until 1778, when it fell a victim of the ridiculous "reforms" of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. Plantin's own masterpiece is the great Antwerp Polyglot Bible in six folio volumes, the "Biblia Regia" issued at Antwerp from 1569 to 1573, and really at Plantin's own expense. Besides the scholarly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Antwerp already mentioned, the city boasts of other notable <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars, the great critic and savant Justus Lipsius, and other helpers of Plantin, e.g. Kiliaen, the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> lexicographer, and <a href="../cathen/11328b.htm">Ortelius</a> and Mercator, the geographers (Max Rooses, Christophe Plantin, imprimeur anversois, Antwerp, 1900). In modern times it is celebrated as the home of <a href="../cathen/04273a.htm">Hendrik Conscience</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> novelist, and of <a href="../cathen/02190c.htm">Augustin De Backer</a>, the erudite biographer of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>.
<h2>The painters of Antwerp</h2>

<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, municipal prosperity, and a certain large-mindedness combined to make Antwerp a centre of artistic life second to none in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. It was often called "the Florence of the North," and was well-known in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> for its "Guild of St. Luke" founded in 1382, and active until the end of the last century. Prominent among the illustrious artists of Antwerp are the great portrait <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Quentin Matsys or Metsys (1466-1530) and <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Peter Paul Rubens</a> (1577-1640), the latter at once a prince of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, courtier, diplomat, and Antwerp's most distinguished citizen. He was also a very devout <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and heard Mass daily before beginning his work. Other famous artists were <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Dyck</a>, Jordaens, <a href="../cathen/14507b.htm">Teniers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13682a.htm">Seghers</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> like Luc Faydherbe and the Quellins. In modern times the genius of the old Antwerp <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> has revived in masters like Wappers, Leys, and others. Religious realism, rich and vivid colouring, vigour of execution, minuteness of detail, abundance of ornate light, characterize the works of the Antwerp School of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>. Their city has long since become a museum of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">religious art</a> unique on the northern side of the Alps and highly expressive of the earnest spiritual <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> of the once warlike burghers, now a new race of merchant-princes. The armies of Jacobin <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> soon became masters of Antwerp (1794) and for the next five years every kind of excess was committed there against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. Priests were exiled, even <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>; the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were closed and pillaged; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> abused and insulted in every conceivable manner; <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, art-works of all kinds belonging to the churches were sold at public auction and only the overthrow of the Directory in November 1799 by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> prevented the demolition and sale of the incomparable <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as mere stone, timber, and iron.
<h2>English Catholic interest</h2>

<p>The interest of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in Antwerp is not a slight one, apart from the close commercial relations that existed from the beginning of the twelfth century to the end of the sixteenth. Persecuted <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> often took refuge in that city; thus <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14394b.htm">royal abbey of Syon House</a>, nearly all of them of noble birth were welcomed there in the time of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of English <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> was founded there in 1619, and flourished until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. When the sisters returned to Lanherne in Cornwall where their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> still exists. Mention is made in the city annals of Gilbert Curle, his wife Barbara Mowbray and his sister Elizabeth Curle, devoted adherents of <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>, the latter, her attendant at the block (<a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a>, Hist. of England, VI, vi, 463). Their house at Antwerp was a shelter for <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Dying, Gilbert Curle bequeathed sixty thousand florins to the Scotch College at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douay</a>. Another English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> resident at Antwerp was the famous <a href="../cathen/15377a.htm">Richard Verstegen</a>, a prominent religious publicist, author of the famous "Theatrum crudelitatis haereticorum" (Antwerp, 1586) with engravings designed by himself, a vivid polemical account of the sufferings of contemporary <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, also of several other works written in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a>.
<h2>Objects of religious interest</h2>

<p>The Cathedral (St. Mary's) begun in 1354 is said to have been 176 years in process of erection. It is cruciform in shape, with triple <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> and an <a href="../cathen/01406b.htm">ambulatory</a>. Its dimensions in feet are: length 384, breadth of <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> 171, breadth of <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> 212, height 130. The vaults are supported by a forest of columns (125). The great northern tower is nearly 400 feet high and was compared by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> to <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> lace hung aloft in mid-air. Its <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a>, built in 1891, contains ninety registers and is said to be the largest in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Among the famous art-treasures of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> are the "Descent from the Cross" and the "Assumption" by <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>. It was much damaged by the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> in 1566 and by the French (1794-98). Other important churches are: St. Charles Borromeo, built 1614-21, and once decorated with thirty-six large ceiling-frescoes by <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>; St. Jacques (1491-1656), once the favourite burial-place of the wealthy and distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of Antwerp and filled with their monuments and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, including the <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>; St. Paul, built by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> (1531-71), since the battle of <a href="../cathen/09181b.htm">Lepanto</a> (1571) the seat of a famous <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">confraternity of the Rosary</a>. There are also churches dedicated to St. Andrew, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a>, Sts. Michael and Peter, and St. Joseph. The Plantin-Moretus Museum exhibits the workshop and residence of that great <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> printers (purchased in 1876 by the municipality) quite as they were in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the various rooms may be seen copies of old <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missals</a> and breviaries, correspondence of learned men (<a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>), portraits of famous editors (<a href="../cathen/01711c.htm">Arias Montanus</a>, Justus Lipsius) employed by Plantin and Moretus, drawings by <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, engravings by famous masters, artistic bindings, and specimens of all the most perfect work done for this establishment of learned printers during their flourishing period. Altogether it is a "unique picture of the dwelling and contiguous business premises of a <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> patrician at the end of the sixteenth century."
