<h1>Apiarius of Sicca</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Sicca, in proconsular Africa. <a href="../cathen/08075a.htm">Interest</a> attaches to him only because of his appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, and the consequent protracted parleying between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Carthage about the privileges of the African Church in regulating its own <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>. In the resentment which the peculiar circumstances of the case provoked in many African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> opponents of the Papacy read the denial by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Papal supremacy; and thus the case of Apiarius has come to be the classical example in anti-Roman controversial works, illustrating the fifth-centruy repudiation of <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal</a> claims to disciplinary control.

<p>Apiarius, deposed by Urbanus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sicca, for grave misconduct, appealed to <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a>, who, in view of irregularities in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> procedure, ordered that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should be reinstated, and his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> disciplined. Chagrined, perhaps, at the unworthy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> success, a general synod of Carthage, in May, 418, forbade appeal "beyond the seas" of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> inferior to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Recognizing in what was virtually a restatement of previous African legislation an expression of displeasure on the part of the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> sent a delegation to defend his right to receive certain appeals, citing decrees believed by him to have been enacted at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, but which in fact were canons of the council of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>. The African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who met the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, while not recognizing these decrees as Nicene, accepted them pending verification. In May, 419, was held the sixteenth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, and there again the representations of Zosimus were accepted, awaiting the result of a comparison of the Nicene canons as they existed in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, in which the decrees cited by the Pope had not been found, with those of the churches of Antioch, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and Constantinople. By the end of the year 419 <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Pope Boniface</a>, who had succeeded Zosimus in December, 418, was informed that the eastern <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> did not contain the alleged decrees; but, as the now repentant Apiarius had meantime been assigned to a new field of labour, interest in the affair subsided. The letter to <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Pope Boniface</a>, while evidencing irritation at the arrogance of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Faustinus, contains nothing incompatible with <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Pope's supremacy.

<p>Some four years later Apiarius relapsed into <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> courses, was once more <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and again appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Pope Celestine, who had succeeded <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Boniface</a> in September, 423, reinstated him and deputed the unwelcome Faustinus to sustain this decision before the African Bishops. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate's</a> exasperating efforts in behalf of the unworthy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> were miserably thwarted by Apiarius's admission of his guilt. Incensed in these provoking circumstances, by the heightened arrogance of Faustinus and the misinformed Pope's haste in sustaining Apiarius, a number of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> addressed to Celestine the famous letter, "Optaremus", in which they bitterly resent the insults of the tactless <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, and request that in future the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> will exercise due discretion in hearing appeals from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and exact from the African Church in such matters no more than was provided for by the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>. This letter, with all his boldness, cannot be construed into a denial of the Pope's <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Africa. It simply voices the desire of the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to continue the enjoyment of those privileges of partial home-rule which went by default to their Church during the stormy period when the theory of universal <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dominion could not be always reduced to practice, because of the trials which the growing church had to endure. But before the time of Apiarius, as the Sardican canons referred to attest, Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> had come to accept <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a court of last appeal in disciplinary causes. Africa, too, was now ready, and its readiness is shown by the case of Apiarius as well as by the records of like appeals to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> himself bears witness.
