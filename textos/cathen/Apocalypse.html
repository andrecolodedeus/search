<h1>Apocalypse</h1>  

<p>Apocalypse, from the verb <em>apokalypto</em>, to reveal, is the name given to the last book in the <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Bible</a>. It is also called the Book of Revelation.

<p>Although a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> work, the Apocalypse belongs to a class of literature dealing with <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatological</a> subjects and much in vogue among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the first century before, and after, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.
<h2>Authenticity</h2>

<p>The author of the Apocalypse calls himself John. "John to the seven churches which are in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs4">Apocalypse 1:4</a>). And again, "I, John, your brother and your partner in tribulation . . . was in the island which called <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a>, for the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs9">1:9</a>).

<p>The Seer does not further specify his personality. But from tradition we know that the Seer of the Apocalypse was <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the Apostle</a> the son of Zebedee, the Beloved Disciple of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. At the end of the second century the Apocalypse was acknowledged by the historical representatives of the principal churches as the genuine work of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the Apostle</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">Melito</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13472a.htm">Sardis</a>, one of the Seven Churches of the Apocalypse, acknowledged the Revelation of John and wrote a <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentary</a> on it (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.26</a>). In Gaul, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> firmly believes in its Divine and Apostolic authority (<a href="../fathers/0103530.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> 5.30</a>). In Africa, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> frequently quotes Revelation without apparent misgivings as to its <a href="../cathen/02137b.htm">authenticity</a> (<a href="../fathers/0312.htm"><em>Against Marcion</em> III</a>). In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Bishop Hippolytus assigns it to the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Apostle St. John</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10642a.htm">Muratorian Fragment</a> (a document about the beginning of the third century) enumerates it along with the other <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">canonical writings</a>, adding, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> <a href="../fathers/1003.htm">Apocalypse of St. Peter</a>, but with the clause, <em>quam quidam ex nostris in ecclesia legi nolunt</em>. The <em>Vetus Itala</em>, moreover, the standard Latin version in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and Africa during the third century, contained the Apocalypse. In <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement</a> and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> believed without hesitation in its <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Joannine</a> authorship. They were both scholars and men of critical judgment. Their opinion is all the more valuable as they had no sympathy with the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">millennial</a> teaching of the book. They contented themselves with an allegorical interpretation of certain passages but never ventured to impugn its authority.

<p>Approaching more closely the apostolic age we have the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin Martyr</a>, about the middle of the second century. From <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.18.8</a>), as well as from his <a href="../fathers/0128.htm">dialogue with the Jew, Tryphon</a> (c. 81), held in Ephesus, the residence of the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">apostle</a>, we know that he admitted the <a href="../cathen/02137b.htm">authenticity</a> of the Apocalypse. Another witness of about the same time is <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias, Bishop of Hierapolis</a>, a place not far from Ephesus. If he himself had not been a hearer of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a>, he certainly was personally acquainted with several of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.39</a>). His evidence however is but indirect. <a href="../cathen/01473a.htm">Andreas, Bishop of Caesarea</a>, in the prologue to his commentary on the Apocalypse, informs us that <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a> admitted its <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> character. From the Apocalypse undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a> derived his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">millennium</a>, on which account <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> decries his authority, declaring him to have been a man of limited understanding. The apostolic writings which are extant furnish no evidence for the <a href="../cathen/02137b.htm">authenticity</a> of the book.
<h2>Arguments against its authenticity</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01331b.htm">Alogi</a>, about A.D. 200, a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> so called because of their rejection of the logos-doctrine, denied the <a href="../cathen/02137b.htm">authenticity</a> of the Apocalypse, assigning it to <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> (Epiphanius, LI, <em>ff</em>, 33; cf. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103311.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III.11.9</a>). Caius, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, of about the same time, holds a similar opinion. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> quotes his words taken from his Disputation: "But <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a> which he pretended were written by a <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">great Apostle</a> falsely pretended to wonderful things, asserting that after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> there would be an earthly kingdom" (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.28</a>). The most formidable antagonist of the authority of the Apocalypse is Dionysius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, disciple of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. He is not opposed to the supposition that <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> is the writer of the Apocalypse. "For", he says, "this is the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, that there will be an earthly reign of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and as he was a lover of the body he dreamed that he would revel in the gratification of the sensual <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a>". He himself did not adopt the view that <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> was the writer. He regarded the Apocalypse as the work of an <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> man but not of an Apostle (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.25</a>). During the fourth and fifth centuries the tendency to exclude the Apocalypse from the list of sacred books continued to increase in the Syro-Palestinian churches. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> expresses no definite opinion. He contents himself with the statement: "The Apocalypse is by some accepted among the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">canonical books</a> but by others rejected" (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.25</a>). <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> does not name it among the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">canonical books</a> (<a href="../fathers/310104.htm">Catechesis IV.33-36</a>); nor does it occur on the list of the Synod of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, or on that of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>. Perhaps the most telling argument against the apostolic authorship of the book is its omission from the Peshito, the Syrian Vulgate. But although the authorities giving evidence against the <a href="../cathen/02137b.htm">authenticity</a> of the Apocalypse deserve full consideration they cannot annul or impair the older and unanimous testimony of the churches. The opinion of its opponents, moreover, was not free from bias. From the manner in which Dionysius argued the question, it is evident that he thought the book dangerous as occasioning crude and sensual notions concerning the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> the Church persevered in its <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of apostolic authorship. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> alone seemed to have been influenced by the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> of the East.
<h2>The Apocalypse compared with the Fourth Gospel</h2>

<p>The relation between the Apocalypse and the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> has been discussed by authors, both ancient and modern. Some affirm and others deny their mutual resemblance.

<p>The learned Alexandrine Bishop, <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius</a>, drew up in his time a list of differences to which modern authors have had little to add. He begins by observing that whereas the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Gospel</a> is anonymous, the writer of the Apocalypse prefixes his name, John. He next points out how the characteristic terminology of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>, so essential to the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Joannine</a> doctrine, is absent in the Apocalypse. The terms, "life", "light", "grace", "truth", do not occur in the latter. Nor did the crudeness of diction on the part of the Apocalypse escape him. The Greek of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Gospel</a> he pronounces correct as to grammar, and he even gives its author credit for a certain elegance of style. But the language of the Apocalypse appeared to him barbarous and disfigured by solecisms. He, therefore inclines to ascribe the works to different authors (<a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.25</a>).

<p>The upholders of a common authorship reply that these differences may be accounted for by bearing in mind the peculiar nature and aim of each work. The Apocalypse contains <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> and <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelations</a>. In conformity with other books of the same kind, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Book of Daniel</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> prefixed his name to his work. The <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Gospel</a> on the other hand is written in the form of an historical record. In the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, works of that kind do not bear the signature of their authors. So also as regards the absence of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Joannine</a> terminology in the Apocalypse. The object of the Gospel is to prove that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the life and the light of the world, the fullness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and grace. But in the Apocalypse <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the conqueror of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and his kingdom. The defects of grammar in the Apocalypse are conceded. Some of them are quite obvious. Let the reader but notice the habit of the author to add an apposition in the nominative to a word in an oblique case; e.g. <a href="../bible/rev003.htm#vrs12">3:12</a>; <a href="../bible/rev014.htm#vrs12">14:12</a>; <a href="../bible/rev020.htm#vrs2">20:2</a>. It further contains some <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> idioms: e.g. the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> equivalent to <em>erchomenos</em>, "the one that is to come", instead of <em>esomenos</em>, <a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs8">1:8</a>. But it should be borne in mind that when the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Apostle</a> first came to Ephesus he was, probably wholly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Greek tongue.

<p>The comparative purity and smoothness of diction in the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Gospel</a> may be adequately accounted for by the plausible conjecture that its literary composition was not the work of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a> but of one of his pupils. The defenders of the identity of authorship further appeal to the striking fact that in both works <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is called the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a> making <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atonement</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by its blood is taken from <a href="../bible/isa053.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. Throughout the Apocalypse the portraiture of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is that of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a>. Through the shedding of its blood it has opened the book with seven <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seals</a> and has triumphed over <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. In the Gospel <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is pointed out by the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Baptist</a> as the "<a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb of God</a> . . . him who taketh away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs29">John 1:29</a>). Some of the circumstances of His death resemble the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> observed in the eating of the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">paschal lamb</a>, the symbol of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>. His crucifixion takes place on the selfsame day on which the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> was eaten (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs28">John 18:28</a>). Whilst hanging on the cross, His executioners did not break the bones in His body, that the prophecy might be fulfilled: "no bone in it shall be broken" (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs36">John 19:36</a>). The name <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, "Word", is quite peculiar to the Apocalypse, <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Gospel</a> and <a href="../bible/1jo000.htm">first Epistle of St. John</a>. The <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs1">first sentence of the Gospel</a> is, "In the beginning was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". The <a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#vrs1">first epistle of St. John</a> begins, "That which was from the beginning which we have heard . . . of the word of life". So also in the Apocalypse, "And his name is called the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/rev019.htm#vrs13">19:13</a>).

<h2>Time and place</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> himself testifies that the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> he is about to narrate were seen by him whilst in <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a>. "I <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> . . . was in the island which is called <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a> for the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and for the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs9">1:9</a>). <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a> is one of the group of small islands close to the coast of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, about twelve geographical miles from Ephesus. <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> tells us, has handed down that <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> was banished to <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a> in the reign of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> for the sake of his testimony of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">God's word</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.18</a>). He obviously refers to the passage "for the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and for the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs9">1:9</a>). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the more probable meaning of this phrase is, "in order to hear the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of God</a>", etc., and not "banished because of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", etc., (cf. <a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs2">1:2</a>). But it was quite natural that the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> should have regarded his banishment to <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a> as prearranged by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> that in the solitude of the island he might hear <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">God's word</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> recorded by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> finds confirmation in the words of the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> describing himself as "a brother and partaker in tribulation" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs9">1:9</a>). <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> places the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer's</a> exile in <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a> at the end of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian's</a> reign. "Paene sub nostro saeculo ad finem Domitiani imperii" (<a href="../fathers/0103504.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> V.4</a>). The <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Emperor Domitian</a> reigned A.D. 81-96. In all matters of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Joannine</a> tradition <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> deserves exceptional credit. His lifetime bordered upon the Apostolic age and his master, <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a>, had been among the disciples of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a>. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, chronicling the statement of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> without any misgivings, adds as the year of the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer's</a> exile the fourteenth of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian's</a> reign. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> also, without reserve or hesitation, follows the same <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>. "Quarto decimo anno, secundam post Neronem persecutionem movente Domitiano, in Patmos insulam relegatus, scripsit Apocalypsim" (Ex libro de Script. Eccl). Against the united testimony of these three witnesses of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> the statement of Epiphanius placing the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer's</a> banishment in the reign of Claudius, A.D. 41-54, appears exceedingly improbable (Haer., li, 12, 33).

<p>The portrait is taken from <a href="../bible/dan010.htm">Daniel 10</a> and <a href="../cathen/01602a.htm">Henoch 46</a>. Cf. the phrases, "one like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs13">Apocalypse 1:13</a>, <a href="../bible/dan010.htm#vrs16">Daniel 10:16</a> and <a href="../bible/dan007.htm#vrs13">7:13</a>); "girded with gold" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs13">Apocalypse 1:13</a>; <a href="../bible/dan010.htm#vrs5">Daniel 10:5</a>); "eyes like flames of fire" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs14">Apocalypse 1:14</a>; <a href="../bible/dan010.htm#vrs6">Daniel 10:6</a>); "a voice like that of a multitude" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs15">Apocalypse 1:15</a>; <a href="../bible/dan010.htm#vrs6">Daniel 10:6</a>); "I fell down like one senseless" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs17">Apocalypse 1:17</a>; <a href="../bible/dan010.htm#vrs9">Daniel 10:9</a>); "and he touched me" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs17">Apocalypse 1:17</a>, <a href="../bible/dan010.htm#vrs18">Daniel 10:18</a>); "hair white like wool" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs14">Apocalypse 1:14</a>; <a href="../bible/dan007.htm#vrs9">Daniel 7:9</a>; <a href="../cathen/01602a.htm">Henoch 46:1</a>).

<h4>The epistles to the seven Churches (2:1-3:22)</h4>

<p>The Churches are Ephesus, <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamum</a>, <a href="../cathen/14713c.htm">Thyatira</a>, <a href="../cathen/13472a.htm">Sardis</a>, <a href="../cathen/11793a.htm">Philadelphia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>. The Epistles are short exhortations to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to remain steadfast in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to beware of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and to abstain from fornication and from meat offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.
<h3 id="B">The book with the seven seals</h3>

<h4>The vision of God enthroned upon the cherubim (chapters 4 and 5)</h4>

<p>The throne is surrounded by twenty-four elders. In the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a scroll <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">sealed</a> with seven <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seals</a>. In the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a> and the elders the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> beholds a <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a>, "agnus tamquam occisus", having on its throat the scar of the gash by which it was slain. The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> weeps because no one either in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or on earth can break the <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seals</a>. He is comforted on hearing that the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a> was worthy to do so because of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> it had wrought by its blood. The portrait of the throne is taken from <a href="../bible/eze001.htm">Ezechiel 1</a>. Compare in both accounts the description of the four beasts. They resemble a lion, an ox, a man, and an eagle. Their bodies are full of eyes (cf. <a href="../bible/rev004.htm#vrs8">Revelation 4:8</a>; and <a href="../bible/eze010.htm#vrs12">Ezekiel 10:12</a>). The twenty-four elders were probably suggested by the twenty-four courses of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> ministering in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a> slain for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> is from <a href="../bible/isa053.htm">Isaias 53</a>.

<h4>The seven seals and the numbering of the saints (chapters 6 and 7)</h4>

<p>At the opening of four <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seals</a>, four horses appear. Their colour is white, black, red, and sallow, or green (<em>chloros</em>, piebald). They signify conquest, slaughter, dearth and death. The vision is taken from <a href="../bible/zec006.htm#vrs1">Zechariah 6:1-8</a>. At the opening of the fifth seal the Seer beholds the martyrs that were slain and hears their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the final triumph. At the opening of the sixth seal the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are numbered and marked. The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> beholds them divided into two classes. First, 144,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 12,000 of every <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe</a>. Then a numberless multitude chosen from all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a> and tongues.

<h4>The seventh seal (chapters 8 and 9)</h4>

<p>After the interval of about half an hour, the seventh seal is broken; seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> issue forth, each one holding a trumpet. The sounding of the first four trumpets causes a partial destruction of the elements of nature. One-third of the earth is burned, as also one-third of the trees and all the grass. One-third of the sea becomes blood (cf. <a href="../bible/exo007.htm#vrs17">Exodus 7:17</a>). One-third of the rivers is turned into water of wormwood. One-third of the sun, moon, and stars is obscured, causing one-third of the day to be dark (cf. <a href="../bible/exo010.htm#vrs21">Exodus 10:21</a>). At the sounding of the fifth trumpet locusts ascend from the <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">abyss</a>. Their work is to torment men for five months, They are specially charged not to touch the grass. Their shape is that of horses (<a href="../bible/joe002.htm#vrs4">Joel 2:4</a>) their teeth like those of lions (<a href="../bible/joe001.htm#vrs6">Joel 1:6</a>), their hair like the hair of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. They have the tails of scorpions where with to chastise <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The command over them is held by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01075d.htm">Abyss</a>, named <a href="../cathen/01005a.htm">Abaddon</a>, the destroyer. At the sound of the sixth trumpet the four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> chained at the Euphrates are let loose. They lead forth an army of horsemen. By the fire which the horses spit out and by their tails which are like serpents, one-third of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> is killed. After the sixth trumpet there are two digressions. (1) The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> standing on the land and the sea. He swears that at the sound of the seventh trumpet the mystery will be completed. He hands to the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> a little book. When eaten by him it is found sweet to taste, but bitter when once devoured. Taken from <a href="../bible/eze002.htm#vrs8">Ezekiel 2:8</a> and <a href="../bible/eze003.htm#vrs3">3:3</a>. (2) The contamination of the court of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. It lasts three and a half years. Taken from <a href="../bible/dan007.htm#vrs25">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="../bible/dan009.htm#vrs27">9:27</a>; <a href="../bible/dan012.htm#vrs7">12:7-11</a>. During that time two witnesses are sent to preach in Jerusalem. They are the two olive-trees foretold by <a href="../bible/zec004.htm#vrs3">Zechariah 4:3-11</a>. At the end of their mission they are slain by the beast. They are <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">raised to life</a> after three and a half days (= years). The seventh trumpet is now sounded, the nations are judged and the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Christ</a> is established.

<h3 id="C">The divine drama</h3>

<h4>First act (chapters 12-14)</h4>

<p><em>The lamb, the woman, and her seed; and opposed to them, the dragon, the beast from the sea, and the beast from the land.</em> The main <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is taken from <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs15">Genesis 3:15</a>. "I will put enmities between thee (the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">serpent</a>) and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">woman</a>, and thy seed and her seed". The <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">woman</a> is arrayed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> splendour; a crown of twelve stars on her head and the sun and the moon under her feet (cf. <a href="../bible/gen037.htm#vrs9">Genesis 37:9-10</a>). She is in travail. Her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> is destined to rule all the nation (<a href="../bible/psa002.htm#vrs8">Psalm 2:8, 9</a>). She herself, and her other seed, are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for three and a half years by the great dragon who tries to <a href="../cathen/15108a.htm">kill</a> them. The great dragon is <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs1">Genesis 3:1</a>). He is cast out of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. With his tail he drags after him one-third of the stars. Taken from <a href="../bible/dan008.htm#vrs10">Daniel 8:10</a>. The fallen stars are the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">fallen angels</a>. The beast from the sea is in great part taken from <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel's</a> description of the four beasts. It arises from the sea (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#vrs3">Daniel 7:3</a>); has seven heads marked all over with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>. It had also ten horns, like the fourth beast of <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#vrs7">7:7</a>); it resembled a leopard, the third beast of <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#vrs6">7:6</a>), it had feet like a bear, the second beast of <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#vrs5">7:5</a>); and teeth like a lion, the first beast of <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#vrs4">7:4</a>). The great dragon gives full power unto the beast, whereupon all the world <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship</a> it (viz. those whose names are not contained in the book of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a>). The followers of the beast have its mark on their head and hand. The beast from the land has two horns like a ram. Its power lies in its art of deceiving by means of tokens and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Throughout the remainder of the book it is called the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> prophet. Its office is to assist the beast from the sea, and to induce <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">adore its image</a>. The first act of the drama concludes with a promise of victory over the beast by the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb of God</a>.

<h4>Second act (chapters 15-16)</h4>

<p><em>The seven vials.</em> They are the seven plagues preceding the destruction of the great city, Babylon. They were for the greater part suggested by the <a href="../cathen/12143a.htm">Egyptian plagues</a>. The first vial is poured out on the earth. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Men</a> and beasts are smitten with ulcers (<a href="../bible/exo009.htm#vrs9">Exodus 9:9-10</a>). The second and third vial upon the seas and rivers. They become blood (<a href="../bible/exo007.htm#vrs17">Exodus 7:17-21</a>). The fourth vial upon the sun. It burns <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to death. The fifth vial upon the throne of the beast. It causes great darkness (<a href="../bible/exo010.htm#vrs11">Exodus 10:11-29</a>). The sixth vial upon the Euphrates. Its waters are dried up and form a passage for the kings of the East (<a href="../bible/exo014.htm">Exodus 14</a>). The seventh upon the air. Storm and earthquake destroy Babylon.

<h4>Third act (chapters 17-18)</h4>

<p><em>The great harlot.</em> She is seated upon the scarlet beast with the seven heads and ten horns. She is robed in scarlet and decked with gold. On her head is written: Mystery, Babylon the great. The kings of the earth commit fornication with her. But the day of her visitation has come. She is made a desolate place, the habitation of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> animals (<a href="../bible/lev013.htm#vrs21">Leviticus 13:21-22</a>). Her fall is lamented by the rulers and merchants of the earth.

<h4>Fourth act (chapters 19-20)</h4>

<p><em>The victory over the beast and the great dragon.</em> A <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">knight</a> appears mounted on a white horse. His name is <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">"The word of God"</a>. He defeats the beast and the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> prophet. They are cast alive in the pool of fire. Their defeat is followed by the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">first resurrection</a> and the reign of Christ for a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a>. The martyrs rise to life and partake with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. During these <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">thousand years</a> the great dragon is held in chains. At their completion he is once more set at large to torment the earth. He deceives the nations <a href="../cathen/06628a.htm">Gog and Magog</a>. These two names are taken from <a href="../bible/eze028.htm">Ezekiel 28</a> and <a href="../bible/eze039.htm">39</a>, where however Gog is the king of Magog. At last he also is cast for all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in the pool of fire. Hereupon the general judgement and the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> take place.

<h4>Fifth act (chapters 21-22)</h4>

<p><em>The new Jerusalem (cf. <a href="../bible/eze040.htm">Ezechiel 40-48</a>).</em> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dwells in the midst of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who enjoy complete <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. The new Jerusalem is the spouse of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a>. The names of the Twelve Tribes and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a> are written on its gates. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a> are the sanctuary in this new city.

<h4>Epilogue (verses 18-21)</h4>

<p>The prophecy of the book is soon to be fulfilled. The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> warns the reader not to add anything to it or take away from it under pain of forfeiting his share in the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly city</a>.
<h2>Purpose of the book</h2>

<p>From this cursory perusal of the book, it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> was influenced by the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecies</a> of <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> more than by any other book. <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a> was written with the object of comforting the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> under the cruel <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Antiochus Epiphanes. The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> in the Apocalypse had a similar purpose. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were fiercely <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> in the reign of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>. The danger of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> was great. <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">False</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> went about, trying to seduce the people to conform to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> practices and to take part in the Caesar-worship. The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> urges his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to remain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to bear their troubles with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. He encourages them with the promise of an ample and speedy reward. He assures them that <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">Christ's triumphant coming</a> is at hand. Both in the beginning and at the end of his book the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> is most emphatic in telling his people that the hour of victory is nigh. He begins, saying: "Blessed is he that . . . keepeth those things which are written in it; for the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> is at hand" (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs3">1:3</a>). He closes his <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> with the pathetic words: "He that giveth testimony of these things saith, Surely I come quickly: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Come, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>". With the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the woes of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> will be avenged. Their oppressors will be given up to the judgment and the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting torments</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> that have fallen will be <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">raised to life</a>, that they may share the pleasures of <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Christ's kingdom</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">millennium</a>. Yet this is but a prelude to the everlasting beatitude which follows after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a>. It is an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> will return at the end of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to judge the living and the dead. But the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of His second advent is unknown. "But of that day and hour no one knoweth, no, not the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> alone" (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs36">Matthew 24:36</a>). It would appear, and is so held by many that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> age expected that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> would return during their own lifetime or generation. This seems to be the more obvious meaning of several passages both in the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> and <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/joh021.htm#vrs21">John 21:21-23</a>, <a href="../bible/1th004.htm#vrs13">1 Thessalonians 4:13-18</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> with them, appear to have shared this fallacious expectation. Their mistaken <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, however, did not affect the soundness of their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the essential part of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Their views of a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">millennial</a> period of corporal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> were equally <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has wholly cast aside the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">millennium</a> previous to the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> has perhaps more than any one else helped to free the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from all crude fancies as regards its pleasures. He explained the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">millennium</a> allegorically and applied it to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of Christ</a> on earth. With the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">millennium</a> began. The first <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">spiritual resurrection</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../fathers/120120.htm"><em>City of God</em> XX</a>). Thus the number 1,000 is to be taken indefinitely.
<h2>Structure of the book and its literary composition</h2>

<p>The subject-matter of the Apocalypse required a threefold division.

<ul> <li>The first part comprises the seven exhortatory letters. <li>The leading <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in the second part is the wisdom of Christ. It is symbolized by the book with seven <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seals</a>. In it are written the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> decrees of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> touching the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">end of the world</a>, and the final victory of good over <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. No one except <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a> slain for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world, is worthy to break the <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seals</a> and read its contents. <li>The third part describes the power of Christ over <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and his kingdom. The <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a> defeats the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">dragon</a> and the beast. This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is developed in a drama of five acts. In five successive scenes we see before us the struggle, the fall of Babylon the harlot, the victory, and final beatitude.</ul>

<p>The third part is not only the most important, but also the most successful from a literary point of view. The drama of the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a> contains several beautiful thoughts of lasting value. The <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">lamb</a>, symbolizing gentleness and purity, conquers the beast, the personification of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and cruelty. The harlot signifies <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. The fornication which the rulers and the nations of the earth commit with her signifies the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship</a> they pay to the images of Caesar and the tokens of his power. The second part is inferior in literary beauty. It contains much that is taken from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and it is full of extravagant imagery. The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> shows a fanciful taste for all that is weird and grotesque. He delights in portraying locusts with hair like that of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and horses with tails like serpents. There are occasional passages revealing a sense of literary beauty. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> removes the curtain of the firmament as a scribe rolls up his scrolls. The stars fall from the heavens like figs from the fig-tree shaken by the storm (<a href="../bible/rev006.htm#vrs12">6:12-14</a>). On the whole, however the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> shows more <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Oriental splendour than the appreciation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> beauty.
<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>It would be alike wearisome and useless to enumerate even the more prominent applications made of the Apocalypse. Racial <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and religious rancour have at all times found in its vision much suitable and gratifying matter. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, etc., have in turn been identified with the beast and the harlot. To the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">"reformers"</a> particularly the Apocalypse was an inexhaustible quarry where to dig for invectives that they might hurl then against the Roman <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. The seven hills of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the scarlet robes of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and the unfortunate abuses of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court made the application easy and tempting. Owing to the patient and strenuous research of scholars, the interpretation of the Apocalypse has been transferred to a field free from the <em>odium theologicum</em>. But then the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> is determined by the rules of common <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. Apart from the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10307a.htm">millennium</a>, and the plagues preceding the final consummation, they see in his <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> references to the leading events of his <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. Their method of interpretation may be called historic as compared with the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and political application of former ages. The key to the mysteries of the book they find in <a href="../bible/rev017.htm#vrs8">17:8-14</a>. For thus says the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a>: "Let here the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that hath understanding give heed".

<p>The beast from the sea that had received plenitude of power from the dragon, or <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, is the Roman Empire, or rather, Caesar, its supreme representative. The token of the beast with which its servants are marked is the image of the emperor on the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of the realm. This seems to be the obvious meaning of the passage, that all business transactions, all buying and selling were impossible to them that had not the mark of the beast (<a href="../bible/rev013.htm#vrs17">Apocalypse 13:17</a>). Against this interpretation it is objected that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had no scruple in handling money on which the image of Caesar was stamped (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs15">Matthew 22:15-22</a>). But it should be borne in mind that the horror of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for the imperial images was principally due to the policy of Caligula. He confiscated several of their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, changing them into <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> by placing his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in them. He even sought to erect an image of himself in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple of Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, Ant., XVIII, viii, 2).

<p>The seven heads of the beast are seven emperors. Five of them the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> says are fallen. They are <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Augustus Tiberius</a>, Caligula, Claudius, and <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. The year of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> death is A.D. 68. The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> goes on to say "One is", namely <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, A.D. 70-79. He is the sixth emperor. The seventh, we are told by the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a>, "is not yet come. But when he comes his reign will be short". Titus is meant, who reigned but two years (79-81). The eighth emperor is <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> (81-96). Of him the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> has something very peculiar to say. He is identified with the beast. He is described as the one that "was and is not and shall come up out of the bottomless pit" (<a href="../bible/rev017.htm#vrs8">17:8</a>). In <a href="../bible/rev017.htm#vrs11">verse 11</a> it is added: "And the beast which was and is not: the same also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into destruction".

<p>All this sounds like <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracular</a> language. But the clue to its solution is furnished by a popular <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> largely spread at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. The death of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> had been <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnessed</a> by few. Chiefly in the East a notion had taken hold of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the people that <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> was still alive. <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were under the illusion that he was hiding himself, and as was commonly thought, he had gone over to the Parthians, the most troublesome foes of the empire. From there they expected him to return at the head of a mighty army to avenge himself on his enemies. The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of this fanciful <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is a well-attested historic fact. Tacitus speaks of it: "Achaia atque Asia falso exterrit velut Nero adventaret, vario super ejus exitu rumore eoque pluribus vivere eum fingentibus credentibusque" (Hist., II, 8). So also Dio Chrysostomus: <em>kai nyn</em> (about A.D. 100) <em>eti pantes epithymousi zen oi de pleistoi kai oiontai</em> (Orat., 21, 10; cf. Suetonius, "Vit. Caes."; s.v. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">NERO</a> and the SIBYLINE ORACLES). Thus the contemporaries of the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> to be alive and expected his return. The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> either shared their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> or utilized it for his own purpose.

<p><a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> had made a name for himself by his cruelty and licentiousness. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in particular had reason to dread him. Under him the first <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> took place. The second occurred under <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>. But unlike the previous one, it was not confined to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but spread throughout the provinces. Many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were put to death, many were banished (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.17-19</a>). In this way the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> was led to regard <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> as a second <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, "Nero redivivus". Hence he described him as "the one that was, that is not, and that is to return". Hence also he counts him as the eighth and at the same time makes him one of the preceding seven, viz. the fifth, <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. The identification of the two emperors suggested itself all the more readily since even <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> authors called <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> a second <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> (<em>calvus Nero</em>, Juvenal. IV, 38). The popular <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> death and return seems to be referred to also in the passage (<a href="../bible/rev013.htm#vrs3">13:3</a>): "And I saw one of its heads as it were slain to death: and its death's wound was healed".

<p>The ten horns are commonly explained as the vassal rulers under the supremacy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They are described as kings (<em>basileis</em>), here to be taken in a wider sense, that they are not real kings, but received power to rule with the beast. Their power, moreover, is but for one hour, signifying its short duration and instability (<a href="../bible/rev017.htm#vrs17">17:17</a>). The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> has marked the beast with the number 666. His purpose was that by this number people may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. He that has understanding, let him count the number of the beast. For it is the number of a man: and his number is six hundred and sixty-six. A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> number, i.e. intelligible by the common rules of investigation. We have here an instance of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> gematria. Its object is to conceal a name by substituting for it a cipher of equal numerical value to the letters composing it. For a long <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> interpreters tried to decipher the number 666 by means of the Greek <a href="../cathen/01333a.htm">alphabet</a>, e.g. Iren&aelig;us, <a href="../fathers/0103533.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> V.33</a>. Their efforts have yielded no satisfactory result. Better success has been obtained by using the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/01333a.htm">alphabet</a>. Many scholars have come to the conclusion that <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> is meant. For when the name <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">"Nero Caesar"</a> is spelled with Hebrew letters, it yields the cipher 666.

<p>The second beast, that from the land, the pseudoprophet whose office was to assist the beast from the sea, probably signifies the work of seduction carried on by <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. They endeavoured to make their fellow <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> adopt the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> practices and submit themselves to the cultus of the Caesar. They are not unlikely the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a> of the seven <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a>. For they are there compared to <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> and <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezabel</a> seducing the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and fornication. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in travail is a personification of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> or the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>. Her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, her other seed is the community of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.

<p>In this interpretation, of which we have given a summary, there are two difficulties:

<ul><li>In the enumeration of the emperors three are passed over, viz. Galba, <a href="../cathen/11351b.htm">Otho</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15486e.htm">Vitellius</a>. But this omission may be explained by the shortness of their reigns. Each one of the three reigned but a few months. <li><a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> assigns the Apocalypse to the reign of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>. But according to the computation given above, the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> himself assigns his work to the reign of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>. For if this computation be correct, <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> is the emperor whom he designates as "the one that is". To this objection, however, it may be answered that it was the custom of apocalyptic writers, e.g., of <a href="../cathen/04621b.htm">Daniel</a>, Enoch, and the <a href="../cathen/13770a.htm">Sibylline books</a>, to cast their <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> into the form of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecies</a> and give them the appearance of being the work of an earlier <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. No literary <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> was thereby intended. It was merely a peculiar style of writing adopted as suiting their subject. The <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Seer</a> of the Apocalypse follows this practice. Though actually banished to <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a> in the reign of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, after the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, he wrote as if he had been there and seen his <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> in the reign of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> when the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> perhaps yet existed. Cf. <a href="../bible/rev002.htm#vrs1">2:1-2</a>.</ul>

<p>We cannot conclude without mentioning the theory advanced by the German scholar <a href="../cathen/15475a.htm">Vischer</a>. He holds the Apocalypse to have been originally a purely <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> composition, and to have been changed into a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> work by the insertion of those sections that deal with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> subjects. From a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> point of view, we think, it cannot be objected to. There are other instances where <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> writers have availed themselves of non-canonical literature. Intrinsically considered it is not improbable. The Apocalypse abounds in passages which bear no specific <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> character but, on the contrary, show a decidedly <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> complexion. Yet on the whole the theory is but a conjecture. (See also <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">A<font size=-2>POCRYPHA</font></a>)
