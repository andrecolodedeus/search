<h1>Apocatastasis</h1>  

<p>(Greek, <em>apokatastasis</em>; Latin, <em>restitutio in pristinum statum</em>, restoration to the original condition).

<p>A name given in the history of theology to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which teaches that a time will come when all free creatures will share in the grace of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; in a special way, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> and lost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was explicitly taught by <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, and in more than one passage. It first occurs in his "De anim&acirc; et resurrectione" (P.G., XLVI, cols. 100, 101) where, in speaking of the punishment by fire assigned to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> after death, he compares it to the process whereby gold is refined in a furnace, through being separated from the dross with which it is alloyed. The punishment by fire is not, therefore, an end in itself, but is ameliorative; the very reason of its infliction is to separate the good from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The process, moreover, is a painful one; the sharpness and duration of the pain are in proportion to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of which each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is guilty; the flame lasts so long as there is any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> left to destroy. A time, then, will come, when all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> shall cease to be since it has no existence of its own apart from the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, in which it inheres; when every <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> shall be turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> shall have no more wherein to exist. Thus, <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> continues, shall the word of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> be fulfilled: <em>Deus erit omnia in omnibus</em> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs28">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>), which means that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> shall, ultimately, have an end, since, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be all in all, there is no longer any place for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (cols. 104, 105; cf. col. 152). <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory</a> recurs to the same thought of the final annihilation of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in his "Oratio catechetica", ch. xxvi; the same comparison of fire which purges gold of its impurities is to be found there; so also shall the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> purge nature of that which is preternatural, namely, of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Such purification will be painful, as is a surgical operation, but the restoration will ultimately be complete. And, when this restoration shall have been accomplished (<em>he eis to archaion apokatastasis ton nyn en kakia keimenon</em>), all creation shall give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which have had no need of purification, and those that shall have needed it. Not only man, however, shall be set free from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, also, by whom <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> entered into the world (<em>ton te anthropon tes kakias eleutheron kai auton ton tes kakias eyreten iomenos</em>). The same teaching is to be found in the "De mortuis" (ibid., col. 536). Bardenhewer justly observes ("Patrologie", Freiburg, 1901, p. 266) that <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory</a> says elsewhere no less concerning the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the fire, and of the punishment of the lost, but that the Saint himself understood this <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> as a period of very long duration, yet one which has a limit. Compare with this "Contra Usurarios" (XLVI, col. 436), where the suffering of the lost is spoken of as eternal, <em>aionia</em>, and "Orat. Catechet.", XXVI (XLV, col. 69), where <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is annihilated after a long period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, <em>makrais periodois</em>. These verbal contradictions explain why the defenders of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> should have thought that <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa's</a> writings had been tampered with by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus of Constantinople</a>, writing in the eighth century, went so far as to say that those who held that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> and lost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> would one day be set free had dared "to instil into the pure and most healthful spring of his [<a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory's</a>] writings the black and dangerous poison of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and to cunningly attribute this foolish <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to a man famous alike for his virtue and his learning" (quoted by Photius, Bibl. Cod., 223; P.G. CIII, col. 1105). <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>, "M&eacute;moires pour l'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique" (Paris, 1703), IX, p. 602, inclines to the opinion that <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> had good grounds for what he said. We must, however, admit, with Bardenhewer (loc. cit.) that the explanation given by <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus of Constantinople</a> cannot hold. This was, also, the opinion of <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, "Theolog. dogmat." (Antwerp, 1700), III, "De Angelis", 109-111.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <em>apokatastasis</em> is not, indeed, peculiar to <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, but is taken from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who seems at times reluctant to decide concerning the question of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of punishment. Tixeront has well said that in his <a href="../fathers/04121.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> (I.6.3)</a> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> does not venture to assert that all the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil angels</a> shall sooner or later return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (P.G., XI, col. 168, 169); while in his "Comment. in Rom.", VIII, 9 (P.G., XIV, col. 1185), he states that Lucifer, unlike the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, will not be converted, even at the end of time. Elsewhere, on the other hand, and as a rule, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> teaches the <em>apokatastasis</em>, the final restoration of all intelligent creatures to friendship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Tixeront writes thus concerning the matter: "Not all shall enjoy the same <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, for in the Father's house there are many mansions, but all shall attain to it. If Scripture sometimes seems to speak of the punishment of the wicked as eternal, this is in order to terrify sinners, to lead them back into the right way, and it is always possible, with attention, to discover the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of these texts. It must, however, always be accepted as a principle that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not chasten except to amend, and that the sole end of His greatest <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the amelioration of the guilty. As the doctor uses fire and steel in certain deep-seated diseases, so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does but use the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> to heal the impenitent sinner. All <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, all impenitent beings that have gone astray, shall, therefore, be restored sooner or later to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> friendship. The evolution will be long, incalculably long in some cases, but a time will come when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall be all in all. Death, the last enemy, shall be destroyed, the body shall be made spiritual, the world of matter shall be transformed, and there shall be, in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, only peace and unity" [Tixeront, Histoire des dogmes, (Paris, 1905), I, 304, 305]. The palmary text of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> should be referred to <a href="../fathers/04123.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> III.6.6</a>. For <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> teaching and the passages wherein it is expressed consult Huet, "Origeniana", II, qu. 11, n. 16 (republished in P.G., XVII, col. 1023-26); and <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, "Theol. dogmat., De Angelis", 107-109; also Harnack ["Dogmengeschichte" (Freiburg, 1894), I, 645, 646], who connects the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> on this point with that of <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>. Tixeront also writes very aptly concerning this matter: "Clement allows that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall be sanctified after death by a spiritual fire, and that the wicked shall, likewise, be punished by fire. Will their chastisement be eternal? It would not seem so. In the Stromata, VII, 2 (P.G., IX, col. 416), the punishment of which Clement speaks, and which succeeds the final judgment, constrains the wicked to repent. In chapter xvi (col. 541) the author lays down the principle that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not punish, but corrects; that is to say that all chastisement on His part is remedial. If <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> be supposed to have started from this principle in order to arrive at the <em>apokatastasis</em>--and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> as well--it is extremely probable that <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> understood it in the same sense" (Histoire des dogmes, I, 277). <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, however, does not seem to have regarded the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <em>apokatastasis</em> as one meant to be preached to all, it being enough for the generality of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that sinners will be punished. (<a href="../fathers/04166.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> VI.26</a>)

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, then, was first taught by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, and was an influence in their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> due to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a> has plainly shown (Theol. dogmat. De Angelis, 106), following <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> <a href="../fathers/120121.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXI.13</a>. Compare Janet, "La philosophiede Platon" (Paris, 1869), I, 603. It is evident, moreover, that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> involves a purely natural scheme of divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>. (Plato, Republic, X, 614b.)

<p>It was through <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <em>apokatastasis</em> passed to <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, and simultaneously to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, at least during the time that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> was an <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenist</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> understands it only of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: "In restitutione omnium, quando corpus totius ecclesi&aelig; nunc dispersum atque laceratum, verus medicus Christus Jesus sanaturus advenerit, unusquisque secundum mensuram fidei et cognitionis Filii Dei&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;suum recipiet locum et incipiet id esse quod fuerat" (Comment. in Eph., iv, 16; P.G., XXVI, col. 503). Everywhere else <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> teaches that the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> and of the impious, that is of those who have not come to the Faith, shall be eternal. (See <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, Theol. dogmat. De Angelis, 111, 112.) The <a href="../cathen/01406a.htm">"Ambrosiaster"</a> on the other hand seems to have extended the benefits of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, (In Eph., iii, 10; P.L., XVII, col. 382), yet the interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/01406a.htm">"Ambrosiaster"</a> on this point is not devoid of difficulty. [See <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, p. 111; also, Turmel, Histoire de la th&eacute;ologie positive, depuis l'origine, etc. (Paris, 1904) 187.]

<p>From the moment, however, that anti-Origenism prevailed, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <em>apokatastasis</em> was definitely abandoned. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> protests more strongly than any other writer against an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> so contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the necessity of grace. See, especially, his "De gestis Pelagii", I: "In Origene dignissime detestatur Ecclesia, quod et iam illi quos Dominus dicit &aelig;terno supplicio puniendos, et ipse diabolus et angeli eius, post tempus licet prolixum purgati liberabuntur a poenis, et sanctis cum Deo regnantibus societate beatitudinis adh&aelig;rebunt." Augustine here alludes to the sentence pronounced against <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> by the Council of Diospolis, in 415 (P.L., XLIV, col. 325). He moreover recurs to the subject in many passages of his writings, and in <a href="../fathers/120121.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXI</a> sets himself earnestly to prove the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of punishment as against the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenist</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> concerning its intrinsically <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatorial</a> character. We note, further, that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <em>apokatastasis</em> was held in the East, not only by <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, but also by <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> as well; "De seipso", 566 (P.G., XXXVII, col. 1010), but the latter, though he asks the question, finally decides neither for nor against it, but rather leaves the answer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. K&ouml;stlin, in the "Realencyklop&auml;die f&uuml;r protestantische Theologie" (Leipzig, 1896), I, 617, art. "Apokatastasis", names <a href="../cathen/05008a.htm">Diodorus of Tarsus</a> and <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> as having also held the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <em>apokatastasis</em>, but cites no passage in support of his statement. In any case, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was formally condemned in the first of the famous <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> pronounced at the Council of Constantinople in 543: <em>Ei tis ten teratode apokatastasis presbeuei anathema esto</em> [See, also, Justinian, Liber adversus Originem, anathemas 7 and 9.] The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was thenceforth looked on as heterodox by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>It was destined, nevertheless, to be revived in the works of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, and it would be interesting to verify K&ouml;stlin's and Bardenhewer's statement that it is to be traced in Bar Sudaili, <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, Maximus the Confessor, <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Erigena, and Amalric of Bena. It reappears at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in the writings of Denk (d. 1527), and Harnack has not hesitated to assert that nearly all the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> were apocatastasists at heart, and that it accounts for their aversion to the traditional teaching concerning the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (Dogmengeschichte, III, 661). The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <em>apokatastasis</em> viewed as a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a universal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is found among the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>, the Moravian Brethren, the Christadelphians, among <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and finally among the professed Universalists. It has been held, also, by such philosophic <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> as Schleiermacher, and by a few <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, Farrar, for instance, in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Eckstein and <a href="../cathen/11786b.htm">Pfister</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Matter in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Consult K&ouml;stlin, art. cit., and Gr&eacute;tillut, "Expos&eacute; de th&eacute;ologie syst&eacute;matique" (Paris, 1890), IV, 603.
