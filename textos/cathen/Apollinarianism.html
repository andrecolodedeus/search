<h1>Apollinarianism</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> theory, according to which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had a human body and a human sensitive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but no human rational <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Divine <em>Logos</em></a> taking the place of this last.

<p>The author of this theory, Apollinaris (<em>Apolinarios</em>) the Younger, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, flourished in the latter half of the fourth century and was at first highly esteemed by men like <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> for his classical culture, his Biblical learning, his defence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and his loyalty to the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He assisted his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Apollinaris the Elder, in reconstructing the scriptures on classical models in order to compensate the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for the loss of Greek literature of which the edict of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> had deprived them. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> credits him with innumerable volumes on the Scriptures; two apologies of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, one against Porphyry, and the other against <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>; a refutation of <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomius</a>, a radical <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, etc.; but all these works are lost. With regard to Apollinaris's writings which bear on the present theory, we are more fortunate. A contemporary anonymous book: <em>Adversus fraudes Apollinaristarum</em>, informs us that the Apollinarists, in order to win credence for their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, circulated a number of tracts under the approved names of such men as <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">Gregory Thaumaturgus</a> (<em>He kata meros pistis</em>, Exposition of Faith), <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> (<em>Peri sarkoseos</em>, On the Incarnation), Pope Julius (<em>Peri tes en Christo enotetos</em>, On Unity in Christ), etc. Following that clue, <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a> (1740), Caspari (1879) and Dr&auml;seke (1892), have shown that in all probability these are Apollinaris's writings. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> who wrote in defence of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, e.g., <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, in two books against Apollinaris; <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, in several letters; <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> in his <em>Antirretikos</em>; Theodoret, in his <em>Haereticae Fabulae</em> and <em>Dialogues</em>, etc., incidentally give us ample information on the real system of the Laodicean.

<p>The precise time at which Apollinaris came forward with his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is uncertain. There are clearly two periods in the Apollinarist controversy. Up to 376, either because of his covert attitude or of the respect in which he was held, Apollinaris's name was never mentioned by his opponents, i.e. by <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> like <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and Pope Damasus, or by councils like the Alexandrian (362), and the Roman (376). From this latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> it is open <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Two more Roman councils, 377 and 381, and a number of Fathers, plainly denounce and condemn as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> the views of Apollinaris. He failed to submit even to the more solemn condemnation of the council of Constantinople, 381, whose first canon entered Apollinarianism on the list of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and he died in his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, about 392. His following, at one time considerable in Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, hardly survived him. Some few disciples, like Vitalis, Valentinus, Polemon, and Timothy, tried to perpetuate the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the master and probably are responsible for the forgeries noticed above. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> itself soon became extinct. Towards 416, many returned to the mother-Church, while the rest drifted away into <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>.
<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>Apollinaris based his theory on two principles or suppositions, one ontological or objective, and one <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> or subjective. Ontologically, it appeared to him that the union of complete <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with complete man could not be more than a juxtaposition or collocation. Two perfect beings with all their attributes, he argued, cannot be one. They are at most an incongruous compound, not unlike the monsters of mythology. Inasmuch as the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> forbade him to belittle the <em>Logos</em>, as Arius had done, he forthwith proceeded to maim the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and divest it of its noblest attribute, and this, he claimed, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Unity and veritable Incarnation. Psychologically, Apollinaris, considering the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or spirit as essentially liable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and capable, at its best, of only precarious efforts, saw no way of saving <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> impeccability and the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> value of Redemption, except by the elimination of the human spirit from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus'</a> humanity, and the substitution of the Divine <em>Logos</em> in its stead. For the constructive part of his theory, Apollinaris appealed to the well-known <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> division of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: body (<em>sarx, soma</em>), <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<em>psyche halogos</em>), spirit (<em>nous, pneuma, psyche logike</em>). <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he said, assumed the human body and the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or principle of animal life, but not the human spirit. The <em>Logos</em> Himself is, or takes the place of, the human spirit, thus becoming the rational and spiritual centre, the seat of self-consciousness and self-determination. By this simple device the Laodicean thought that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was safe, His substantial unity secure, His moral immutability guaranteed, and the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> value of Redemption made self-evident. And in confirmation of it all, he quoted from St. John i, 14 "and the Word was made flesh"; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, Phil., ii, 7, Being made in the likeness of men and in habit found as a man, and <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs47">1 Corinthians 15:47</a> The second man, from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, heavenly.
<h2>Doctrine of the Church</h2>

<p>It is to be found in the seventh <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> of Pope Damasus in the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 381. <em>"We pronounce <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against them who say that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is in the human flesh in lieu and place of the human rational and intellective <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is the Son Himself. Neither did He come in the flesh to replace, but rather to assume and preserve from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and save the rational and intellective <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man."</em> In answer to Apollinaris's basic principles, the Fathers simply denied the second as <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a>. As to the first, it should be remembered that the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon had not yet formulated the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">Hypostatical Union</a>. It will then appear why the Fathers contented themselves with offering arguments in rebuttal, e.g.:

<ul> <li>Scripture holds that the <em>Logos</em> assumed all that is human &#151; therefore the <em>pneuma</em> also &#151; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone excepted; that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> experienced <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and sadness, both being properties of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <li>Christ without a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not a man; such an incongruous compound, as that imagined by Apollinaris, can neither be called God-man nor stand as the model of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. <li>What Christ has not assumed He has not healed; thus the noblest portion of man is excluded from Redemption. </ul>

<p>They also pointed out the correct meaning of the Scriptural passages alleged by Apollinaris, remarking that the word <em>sarx</em> in St. John, as in other parts of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, was used by synecdoche for the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (Philippians and I Corinthians) was determined by the clear teaching of the Pastoral Epistles. Some of them, however, incautiously insisted upon the limitations of <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">Jesus' knowledge</a> as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> positive that His mind was truly human. But when the heresiarch would have taken them farther afield into the very mystery of the Unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they feared not to acknowledge their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and gently derided Apollinaris's mathematical spirit and implicit reliance upon mere speculation and human reasoning. The Apollinarist controversy, which nowadays appears somewhat childish, had its importance in the history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>; it transferred the discussion from the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> into the <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> field; moreover, it opened that long line of <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> debates which resulted in the Chalcedonian symbol.
