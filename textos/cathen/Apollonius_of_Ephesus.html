<h1>Apollonius of Ephesus</h1>  

<p>Anti-Montanist Greek <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer, between 180 and 210, probably from <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, for he is thoroughly acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Christian history</a> of Ephesus and the doings of the Phrygian <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>. If we may accept what the unknown author of "Praedestinatus" says (I, 26, 27, 28; P.L., LIII, 596), he was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ephesus, but the silence of other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers renders this testimony <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. He undertook the defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against Montanus, and followed in the footsteps of Zoticus of Comanus, Julian of Apamaea, Sotas of Anchialus, and Apollinaris of Hierapolis. His work is cited by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.18</a>), and is praised by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 40</a>), but has been lost, and not even its title is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. It seems certain that it showed the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a> prophecies, recounted the unedifying lives of Montanus and his prophetesses, also gave currency to the report of their <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> by hanging, and threw light on some of the adepts of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, including the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> Themison, and the pseudo-martyr Alexander. The former, having evaded <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> by means of money, posed as an innovator, addressing a letter to his partisans after the manner of the Apostles, and finally blasphemed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the latter, a <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> thief, publicly condemned at Ephesus, had himself adored as a god. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> that Apollonius spoke in his work of Zoticus, who had tried to <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcise</a> Maximilla, but had been prevented by Themison, and of the martyr-Bishop Thraseas, another adversary of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanism</a>. He very probably gave the signal in it for the movement of opposition to <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanism</a> which the reunion of the first <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> developed. At all events, he recalls the tradition according to which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> had advised the Apostles not to go far from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> during the twelve years immediately following His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, a tradition known to <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> "Praedicatio Petri". He moreover recounts the restoration to life of a dead man at Ephesus by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> St. John, whose Apocalypse he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and quotes. He takes rank among the opponents of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanism</a> with the "Anonymous" of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.16-17</a>), with Miltiades and with Apollinaris. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (loc. cit.) says his work constituted "an abundant and excellent refutation of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanism</a>". <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> qualified it as "a lengthy and remarkable volume". It did not therefore pass unnoticed, and must have roused some feeling among the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> since <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> felt it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to reply to it. After his six books <em>peri ekstaseos</em>, in which he apologized for the <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> into which the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a> prophetesses fell before <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesying</a>, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> composed a seventh especially to refute Apollonius; he wrote it also in Greek for the use of the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>.
