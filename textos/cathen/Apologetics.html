<h1>Apologetics</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a> which has for its purpose the explanation and defence of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>.

<p>Apologetics means, broadly speaking, a form of apology. The term is derived from the Latin adjective, <em>apologeticus</em>, which, in turn has its origin in the Greek adjective, <em>apologetikos</em>, the substantive being <em>apologia</em>, "apology", "defence". As an equivalent of the plural form, the variant, "Apologetic", is now and then found in recent writings, suggested probably by the corresponding French and German words, which are always in the singular. But the plural form, "Apologetics", is far more common and will doubtless prevail, being in harmony with other words similarly formed, as ethics, statistics, homiletics. In defining apologetics as a form of apology, we understand the latter word in its primary sense, as a verbal defence against a verbal attack, a disproving of a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> accusation, or a justification of an action or line of conduct wrongly made the object of censure. Such, for example, is the <em>Apology</em> of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, such the <em>Apologia</em> of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">John Henry Newman</a>. This is the only sense attaching to the term as used by the ancient Greeks and Romans, or by the French and Germans of the present day.

<p>Quite different is the meaning now conveyed by our English word, "apology", namely, an explanation of an action acknowledged to be open to blame. The same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is expressed almost exclusively by the verb, "apologize", and generally by the adjective, "apologetic". For this reason, the adoption of the word, "Apologetics", in the sense of a scientific vindication of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> is not altogether a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> one. Some scholars prefer such terms as "Christian Evidences", the "Defence of the Christian Religion". "Apologetics" and "Apology" are not altogether interchangeable terms. The latter is the generic term, the former the specific. Any kind of accusation, whether personal, social, political, or religious, may call forth a corresponding apology. It is only apologies of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> that fall within the scope of apologetics. Nor is it all such. There is scarcely a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, scarcely a ritual or disciplinary institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that has not been subjected to hostile criticism, and hence, as occasion required, been vindicated by proper apologetics. But besides these forms of apology, there are the answers that have been called forth by attacks of various kinds upon the credentials of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, apologies written to vindicate now this, now that ground of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that has been called in question or held up to disbelief and ridicule.

<p>Now it is out of such apologies for the foundations of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of apologetics has taken form. Apologetics is the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Apology <em>par excellence</em>, combining in one well-rounded system the arguments and considerations of permanent value that have found expression in the various single apologies. The latter, being answers to specific attacks, were necessarily conditioned by the occasions that called them forth. They were personal, controversial, partial vindications of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> position. In them the refutation of specific charges was the prominent element. Apologetics, on the other hand, is the comprehensive, scientific vindication of the grounds of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, in which the calm, impersonal presentation of underlying principles is of paramount importance, the refutation of objections being added by way of corollary. It addresses itself not to the hostile opponent for the purpose of refutation, but rather to the inquiring mind by way of information. Its aim is to give a scientific presentation of the claims which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christ's revealed religion</a> has on the assent of every rational mind; it seeks to lead the inquirer after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to recognize, first, the reasonableness and trustworthiness of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> revelation as realized in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and secondly, the corresponding <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of accepting it. While not compelling <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> &#151; for the certitude it offers is not absolute, but moral &#151; it shows that the credentials of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> amply suffice to vindicate the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a rational act, and to discredit the estrangement of the sceptic and unbeliever as unwarranted and culpable. Its last word is the answer to the question: Why should I be a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>? Apologetics thus leads up to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to the acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as the divinely authorized organ for preserving and rendering efficacious the saving <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> revealed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This is the great fundamental <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> on which all other <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> rest. Hence apologetics also goes by the name of "fundamental <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>". Apologetics is generally viewed as one branch of dogmatic <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, the other and chief branch being <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> proper. It is well to note, however, that in point of view and method also they are quite distinct. Dogmatic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, like <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, addresses itself primarily to those who are already <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. It presupposes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Apologetics, on the other hand, in theory at least, simply leads up to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The former begins where the latter ends. Apologetics is pre-eminently a positive, historical discipline, whereas <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> is rather philosophic and <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deductive</a>, using as its premises data of divine and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority &#151; the contents of revelation and their interpretation by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is only in exploring and in treating dogmatically the elements of natural religion, the sources of its authoritative data, that <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> comes in touch with apologetics.

<p>As has been pointed out, the object of apologetics is to give a scientific answer to the question, <em>Why should I be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>?</em> Now this question involves two others which are also fundamental. The one is: <em>Why should I be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rather than an adherent of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrian</a>, or of some other religious system setting up a rival claim to be revealed?</em> The other, still more fundamental, question is: <em>Why should I profess any religion at all?</em> Thus the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of apologetics easily falls into three great divisions: <ul> <li>First, the study of religion in general and the grounds of theistic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>; <li>second, the study of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> and the grounds of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>; <li>third, the study of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of Christ</a> and the grounds of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. </ul> In the first of these divisions, the apologist inquirers into the nature of religion, its universality, and man's natural capacity to acquire religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. In connection with this the modern study of the religious philosophy of uncultured peoples has to be taken into consideration, and the various theories concerning the origin of religion present themselves for critical discussion. This leads to the examination of the grounds of theistic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, including the important questions of <ul><li>the existence of a divine Personality, the Creator and Conserver of the world, exercising a special providence over man; <li>man's freedom of will and his corresponding religious and moral responsibility in virtue of his dependence on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the future life with its attendant rewards and punishments.</ul> Coupled with these questions is the refutation of monism, determinism, and other anti-theistic theories. Religious philosophy and apologetics here march hand in hand.



<p>The second division, on <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>, is even more comprehensive. After treating the notion, possibility, and moral necessity of a divine revelation, and its discernibility through various internal and external criteria, the apologist proceeds to establish the <em>fact</em> of revelation. Three distinct, progressive stages of revelation are set forth: Primitive Revelation, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> Revelation, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Revelation. The chief sources on which he has to rely in establishing this triple fact of revelation are the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>. But if he is <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, he must prescind from their inspiration and treat them provisionally as human historical documents. Here he must depend on the critical study of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a> by impartial scriptural scholars, and build on the accredited results of their researches touching the authenticity and trustworthiness of the sacred books purporting to be historical. It is only by anticipation that an argument for the fact of primitive revelation can be based on the ground that it is taught in the inspired book of Genesis, and that it is implied in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> state of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a>. In the absence of anything like contemporary documents, the apologist has to lay chief stress on the high antecedent probability of primitive revelation, and show how a revelation of limited, but sufficient scope for primitive man is compatible with a very crude stage of material and &aelig;sthetic culture, and hence is not discredited by the sound results of prehistoric arch&aelig;ology. Closely connected with this question is the scientific study of the origin and antiquity of man, and the unity of the human species; and, as still larger subjects bearing on the historic value of the sacred Book of Origins, the compatibility with Scripture of the modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> of biology, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and geology. In like manner the apologist has to content himself with showing the fact of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> revelation to be highly probable. The difficulty, in the present condition of <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> criticism, of recognizing more than a small portion of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> as documentary evidence contemporary with Moses, makes it incumbent on the apologist to proceed with caution lest, in attempting to prove too much, he may bring into discredit what is decidedly tenable apart from dogmatic considerations. However, there is sufficient evidence allowed by all but the most radical critics to establish the fact that Moses was the providential instrument for delivering the Hebrew people from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> bondage, and for teaching them a system of religious legislation that in lofty <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheism</a> and <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> worth is far superior to the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and customs of the surrounding nations, thus affording a strong presumption in favour of its claim to be revealed. This presumption gains strength and clearness in the light of <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> prophecy, which shines with ever increasing volume and brightness through the history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a> till it illumines the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of our Divine Lord. In the study of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> revelation, biblical arch&aelig;ology is of no small service to the apologist.

<p>When the apologist comes to the subject of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> revelation, he finds himself on much firmer ground. Starting with the generally recognized results of <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> criticism, he is enabled to show that the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">synoptic Gospels</a>, on the one hand, and the undisputed <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, on the other, offer two independent, yet mutually corroborative, masses of evidence concerning the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and work of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. As this evidence embodies the unimpeachable testimony of thoroughly reliable eye-witnesses and their associates, it presents a portraiture of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> that is truly historical. After showing from the records that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> taught, now implicitly, now explicitly, that he was the long expected <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> sent by His Heavenly Father to enlighten and save <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and to found the new kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, Apologetics proceeds to set forth the grounds for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in these claims: <ul><li>the surpassing beauty of His moral character, stamping Him as the unique, perfect man; <li>the lofty excellence of His moral and religious teaching, which has no parallel elsewhere, and which answers the highest aspirations of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; <li>His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought during His public mission; <li>the transcendent <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, which He foretold as well; <li>the wonderful regeneration of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> through His undying personal influence.</ul> Then, by way of supplementary <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, the apologist institutes an impartial comparison of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with the various rival religious systems of the world &#151; <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminism</a>, <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucianism</a>, Taoism, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> &#151; and shows how in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of its founder, in its moral and <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> ideal and influence, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> is immeasurably superior to all others, and alone has a claim to our assent as the absolute, divinely-revealed religion. Here, too, in the survey of <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, the specious objection, not uncommon today, that <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and legends have contributed to the formation of the Gospels, calls for a summary refutation.

<p>Beyond the fact of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> revelation the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> apologist does not proceed. But the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rightly insists that the scope of apologetics should not end here. Both the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> records and those of the sub-Apostolic age bear witness that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was meant to be something more than a religious philosophy of life, more than a mere system of individual <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and practice, and that it cannot be separated historically from a concrete form of social organization. Hence <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apologetics adds, as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sequel to the established fact of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> revelation, the demonstration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of Christ</a> and its identity with the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a>. From the records of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and their immediate successors is set forth the institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, unequal <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, endowed with the supreme authority of its <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Founder</a>, and commissioned in His name to teach and sanctify <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; possessing the essential features of visibility, indefectibility, and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>; characterized by the distinctive marks of unity, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, catholicity, and <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolicity</a>. These notes of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of Christ</a> are then applied as criteria to the various rival <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> of the present day, with the result that they are found fully exemplified in the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a> alone. With the supplementary exposition of the primacy and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, the work of apologetics is brought to its fitting close. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that some apologists see fit to treat also of inspiration and the analysis of the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But, strictly speaking, these are not apologetic subjects. While they may <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> be included in the prolegomena of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, they rather belong, the one to the province of Scripture-study, the other to the tract of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> dealing with the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtues.

<p>The history of apologetic literature involves the survey of the varied attacks that have been made against the grounds of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. It may be marked off into four great divisions. <ul> <li>The <em>first</em> division is the period from the beginning of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to the downfall of the Roman Empire (A.D. 476). It is chiefly characterized by the twofold struggle of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. <li>The <em>second</em> division is coextensive with the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, from A.D. 476 to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. In this period we find <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in conflict with the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> religion and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. <li>The <em>third</em> division takes in the period from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> to the rise of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the middle of the seventeenth century. It is the period of struggle between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. <li>The <em>fourth</em> division embraces the period of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, from the middle of the seventeenth century down to the present day. Here we find <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in conflict with <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a>, <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">Naturalism</a>. </ul>
<h2>First period</h2>
<h3 id="A">Apologies in answer to the opposition of Judaism</h3>

<p>It lay in the nature of things that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> should meet with strong Jewish opposition. In dispensing with <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and other works of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had incurred the imputation of running counter to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> immutable will. Again, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and obscure life, ending in the ignominious death on the cross, was the very opposite of what the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> expected of their <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a>. Their judgment seemed to be confirmed by the fact that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> attracted but an insignificant portion of the Jewish people, and spread with greatest vigour among the despised <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. To justify the claims of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> before the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the early apologists had to give an answer to these difficulties. Of these apologies the most important is the "Dialogue with Trypho the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>" composed by <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> about 155-160. He vindicates the new religion against the objections of the learned <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, arguing with great cogency that it is the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, and showing by an imposing array of <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> passages that the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> point to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> and the incarnate <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. He insists also that it is in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> that the destiny of the Hebrew religion to become the religion of the world is to find its realization, and hence it is the followers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and not the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>. By his elaborate argument from <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> prophecy, <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> won the grateful recognition of later apologists. Similar apologies were composed by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Against the Jews" (Adversus Jud os, about 200), and by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, "Three Books of Evidences against the Jews" (about 250).
<h3 id="B">Apologies in answer to pagan opposition</h3>

<p>Of far more serious moment to the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> was the bitter opposition it met from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheistic religion</a> of the Roman Empire, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> for its antiquity, was intertwined with every fibre of the body politic. Its providential influence was a matter of firm <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. It was associated with the highest culture, and had the sanction of the greatest poets and sages of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Its splendid <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and stately ritual gave it a grace and dignity that captivated the popular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheism</a> was an innovation. It made no imposing display of liturgy. Its disciples were, for the most part, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> birth and station. Its sacred literature had little attraction for the fastidious reader accustomed to the elegant diction of the classic authors. And so the popular mind viewed it with misgivings, or despised it as an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. But opposition did not end here. The uncompromising attitude of the new religion towards <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rites was decried as the greatest impiety. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were branded as <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a>, and as they held aloof from the public functions also, which were invariably associated with these <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> rites, they were accused of being enemies of the State. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> custom of worshipping in secret assembly seemed to add force to this charge, for <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a> were forbidden by <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>. Nor were <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> wanting. The popular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> easily distorted the vaguely-known Agape and Eucharistic Sacrifice into abominable rites marked by feasting on infant flesh and by indiscriminate <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. The outcome was that the people and authorities took alarm at the rapidly spreading Church and sought to repress it by force. To vindicate the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cause against these attacks of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, many apologies were written. Some, notably the "Apology" of <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> (150), the "Plea for the Christians", by <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a> (177), and the "Apologetic" of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (197), were addressed to emperors for the express purpose of securing for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> immunity from <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Others were composed to convince the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of the folly of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> and of the saving <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Such were: <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, "Discourse to the Greeks" (160), Theophilus, "Three Books to Autolychus" (180), the <a href="../cathen/05008b.htm">"Epistle to Diognetus"</a> (about 190), the "Octavius" of <a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a> (192), <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, "True Discourse against Celsus" (248), Lactantius, <a href="../fathers/0701.htm"><em>Institutes</em></a> (312), and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, "City of God" (414-426). In these apologies the argument from <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> prophecy has a more prominent place than that from <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. But the one on which most stress is laid is that of the transcendent excellence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Though not clearly marked out, a twofold line of thought runs through this argument: <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is light, whereas <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> is darkness; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is power, whereas <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> is weakness. Enlarging on these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, the apologists contrast the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> coherence of the religious tenets of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and its lofty <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> teaching, with the follies and inconsistencies of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, the low <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> principles of its <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and the indecencies of its mythology and of some of its rites. They likewise show that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> alone has the power to transform man from a slave of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> into a spiritual freeman. They compare what they once were as <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> with what they now are as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. They draw a telling contrast between the loose morality of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and the exemplary lives of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, whose devotion to their religious principles is stronger than death itself.
<h2>Second period. Christianity in conflict with Mohammedan religion and philosophy</h2>

<p>The one dangerous rival with which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had to contend in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan religion</a>. Within a century of its birth, it had torn from <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> some of its fairest lands, and extended like a huge crescent from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> over Northern Africa, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Palestine, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, to the eastern part of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. The danger which this fanatic religion offered to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, in countries where the two <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> came in contact, was not to be treated lightly. And so we find a series of apologies written to uphold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the face of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Perhaps the earliest was the "Discussion between a Saracen and a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>" composed by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (about 750). In this apology he vindicates the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Incarnation against the rigid and fatalistic conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> taught by <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>. He also demonstrates the superiority of the religion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, pointing out the grave defects in <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> life and teaching, and showing the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a> to be in its best parts but a feeble imitation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>. Other apologies of a similar kind were composed by Peter the Venerable in the twelfth, and by Raymond of Martini in the thirteenth century. Hardly less dangerous to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> was the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> philosophy of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a>. The Arabian conquerors had learned from the Syrians the arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> of the Greek world. They became especially proficient in medicine, mathematics, and philosophy, for the study of which they erected in every part of their domain <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>. In the twelfth century <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> had nineteen colleges, and their renown attracted hundreds of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> scholars from every part of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Herein lay a grave menace to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">Christian orthodoxy</a>, for the philosophy of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> as taught in these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> had become thoroughly tinctured with Arabian <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>. The peculiar tenet of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> was much in vogue, namely: that philosophy and religion are two independent spheres of thought, so that what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the one may be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in the other. Again, it was commonly taught that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is for the masses who cannot think for themselves, but philosophy is a higher form of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which noble minds should seek to acquire. Among the fundamental <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> denied by the Arabian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were creation, providence, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. To vindicate <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> against <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> composed (1261-64) his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> "Summa contra Gentiles", in four books. In this great apology the respective claims of reason and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are carefully distinguished and harmonized, and a systematic demonstration of the grounds of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is built up with arguments of reason and authority such as appealed directly to the minds of that day. In treating of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, providence, creation and the future life, St. Thomas refutes the chief <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Arabian, Jewish, and Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and shows that the genuine teaching of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> confirms the great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of religion. Three apologies composed in much the same spirit, but belonging to a later age, may be mentioned here. The one is the fine work of Louis Viv&eacute;s, "De Veritate Fidei Christian&aelig; Libri V" (about 1530). After treating the principles of natural <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, the Incarnation, and Redemption, he gives two dialogues, one between a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, the other between a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammaden</a>, in which he shows the superiority of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. Similar to this is the apology of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Grotius, "De Veritate Religionis Christian&aelig;" (1627). It is in six books. An able treatise on natural <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is followed by a demonstration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> based on the life and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of His teaching, and the wonderful propagation of His religion. In proving the authenticity and trustworthiness of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>, Grotius appeals largely to internal evidence. The latter part of the work is devoted to a refutation of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>. An apology on somewhat similar lines is that of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a>, Philip de Mornay, "De la v&eacute;rit&eacute; de la religion chr&eacute;tienne" (1579). It is the first apology of note that was written in a modern tongue.
<h2>Third period. Catholicism in conflict with Protestantism</h2>

<p>The outbreak of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in the beginning of the sixteenth century, and its rejection of many of the fundamental features of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, called forth a mass of controversial apologetic literature. It was not, of course, the first time that the principles of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> had been questioned with reference to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">Christian orthodoxy</a>. In the early ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, assuming the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to profess allegiance and fidelity to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, had given occasion to <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> "On Heresies", <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> "On Prescription against Heretics," St. Vincent of L&eacute;rins, in his "Commonitory", to insist on unity with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and, for the purpose of confuting the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of private interpretation, to appeal to an authoritative <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>. In like manner, the rise of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> in the three centuries preceding the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> led to an accentuation of the fundamental principles of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, notably in <a href="../cathen/10479a.htm">Moneta's</a> "Summa contra Catharos et Waldenses" (about 1225), and Torquemada's "Summa de Ecclesi&acirc;" (1450). So to a far greater extent, in the outpouring from many sources of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, it became the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the hour to defend the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of Christ</a>, to vindicate its authority, its divinely authorized <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> under the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, its visibility, unity, perpetuity, and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, along with other doctrines and practices branded as <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>.

<p>In the first heat of this gigantic controversy the writings on both sides were sharply polemic, abounding in personal recriminations. But towards the close of the century there developed a tendency to treat the controverted questions more in the manner of a calm, systematic apology. Two works belonging to this time are especially noteworthy. One is the "Disputations de controversiis Christian&aelig; Fidei" (1581-92), by Robert Bellarmin, a monumental work of vast erudition, rich in apologetic material. The other is the "Principiorum Fidei Doctrinalium Demonstratio" (1579), by Robert Stapleton, whom <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> pronounced to be the prince of controversialists. Though not so erudite, it is more profound than the work of Bellarmin. Another excellent work of this period is that of <a href="../cathen/02380a.htm">Martin Becan</a>, "De Ecclesi&acirc; Christi" (1633).
<h2>Fourth period. Christianity in conflict with Rationalism</h2>
<h3 id="A">From the middle of the seventeenth to the nineteenth century</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> &#151; the setting up of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> as the source and measure of all knowable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> &#151; is, of course, not confined to any one period of human history. It has existed from the earliest days of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. But in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> it did not become a notable factor till the middle of the seventeenth century, when it asserted itself chiefly in the form of <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a>. It was associated, and even to a large extent identified with the rapidly growing movement towards greater <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> freedom which, stimulated by fruitful scientific inquiry, found itself seriously hampered by the narrow views of inspiration and of historic Bible-interpretation which then prevailed. The Bible had been set up as an <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> source of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> not only in matters of religion, but of history, <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>, and physical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. The result was a reaction against the very essentials of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a> became the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> fashion of the day, leading in many cases to downright <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>. Starting with the principle that no religious <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is of value that cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by experience or by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> reflection, the <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deists</a> admitted the existence of a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> external to the world, but denied every form of divine intervention, and accordingly rejected revelation, inspiration, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and prophecy. Together with unbelievers of a still more pronounced type, they assailed the historic value of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, decrying its <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> narratives as <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. The movement started in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and in the eighteenth century spread to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Its baneful influence was deep and far-reaching, for it found <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> exponents in some of the leading <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and men of letters &#151; Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Voltaire, Rousseau, d'Alembert, Diderot, Lessing, <a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder</a>, and others. But able apologists were not lacking to champion the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cause. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> produced several that won lasting <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for their scholarly defence of fundamental <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> &#151; Lardner, author of the "Credibility of the Gospel History", in twelve volumes (1741-55); Butler, likewise famous for his "Analogy of Religion Natural and Revealed to the Constitution of Nature" (1736); Campbell, who in his "Dissertation on Miracles" (1766) gave a masterly answer to Hume's arguments against <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; and Paley, whose "Evidences of Christianity" (1794) and "Natural Theology" (1802) are among the classics of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> literature. On the continent, the work of defence was carried on by such men as Bishop Huet, who published his "D&eacute;monstration Evang&eacute;lique" in 1679; Leibnitz, whose "Th&eacute;odic&eacute;e" (1684), with its valuable introduction on the conformity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with reason, had a great influence for good; the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbot Gerbert, who gave a comprehensive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> apology in his "Demonstratio Ver&aelig; Religionis Ver que Ecclesi&aelig; Contra Quasvis Falsas" (1760); and the Abb&eacute; Bergier, whose "Trait&eacute; historique et dogmatique de la vraie religion", in twelve volumes (1780), showed ability and erudition.

<p>In the last century the conflict of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> was in part lightened and in part complicated by the marvelous development of scientific and historic inquiry. Lost languages, like the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a>, were recovered, and thereby rich and valuable records of the past &#151; many of them unearthed by laborious and costly excavation &#151; were made to tell their story. Much of this bore on the relations of the ancient Hebrew people with the surrounding nations and, while in some instances creating new difficulties, for the most part helped to corroborate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> history. Out of these researches have grown a number of valuable and interesting apologetic studies on <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> history: Schrader, "Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament" (London, 1872); Hengstenberg's "Egypt and the Books of Moses" (London, 1845); Harper, "The Bible and Modern Discoveries" (London, 1891); McCurdy, "History, Prophecy, and the Monuments" (London-New York, 1894-1900); Pinches, "The Old Testament in the Light of the Historic Records of Assyria and Babylonia" (London-New York, 1902); Abb&eacute; Gainet, "La bible sans la bible, ou l'histoire de l'ancien testament par les seuls t&eacute;moignages profanes" (Bar-le-Duc, 1871); Vigouroux, "La bible et les d&eacute;couvertes modernes" (Paris, 1889). On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/03731a.htm">Biblical chronology</a>, as then understood, and the literal historic interpretation of the Book of Genesis were thrown into confusion by the advancing <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, with its grand nebular hypothesis; biology, with its even more fruitful theory of evolution; geology, and prehistoric arch&aelig;ology. <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> eagerly laid hold of these scientific data, and sought to turn them to the discredit of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and likewise of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. But able apologies were forthcoming to essay a conciliation of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and religion. Among them were: Dr. (afterwards Cardinal) <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a>, "Twelve Lectures on the Connection between Science and Revealed Religion" (London, 1847), which, though antiquated in parts, is still valuable reading; Reusch, "Nature and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>" (London, 1876). Others more modern and up to date are: Duilh&eacute; de Saint-Projet, "Apologie scientifique de la foi chr&eacute;tienne" (Paris, 1885); Abb&eacute; Guibert, "In the beginning" (New York, 1904), one of the best <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> treatises on the subject; and more recent still, <a href="../cathen/08799a.htm">A. de Lapparent</a>, "Science et apolog&eacute;tique" (Paris, 1905). A more delicate form of scientific inquiry for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> was the application of the principles of historic criticism to the books of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. Not a few <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> scholars looked with grave misgivings on the progress made in this legitimate department of human research, the results of which called for a reconstruction of many traditional views of Scripture. <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> found here a congenital field of study, which seemed to promise the undermining of Scripture-authority. Hence it was but natural that the encroachments of Biblical criticism on conservative <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> should be disputed inch by inch. On the whole, the outcome of the long and spirited contest has been to the advantage of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, so long attributed to Moses, is now held by the vast majority of non-Catholic, and by an increasing number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, scholars to be a compilation of four independent sources put together in final shape soon after the Captivity. But the antiquity of much of the contents of these sources has been firmly established, as well as the strong presumption that the kernel of the Pentateuchal legislation is of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> institution. This has been shown by Kirkpatrick in his "Divine Library of the Old Testament" (London-New York, 1901), by Driver in his "Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament" (New York, 1897), and by Abb&eacute; Lagrange, in his "M&eacute;thode historique de l'Ancien Testament" (Paris, 1903; tr. London, 1905). In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the results of Biblical criticism are still more assuring. The attempt of the T&uuml;bingen <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to throw the Gospels far into the second century, and to see in most of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> the work of a much later hand, has been absolutely discredited. The <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">synoptic Gospels</a> are now generally recognized, even by advanced critics, to belong to the years 65-85, resting on still earlier written and oral sources, and the Gospel of St. John is brought with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> down to at least A.D. 110, that is, within a very few years of the death of St. John. The three Epistles of St. John are recognized as genuine, the pastoral letters being now the chief object of dispute. Closely connected with the theory of the T&uuml;bingen School, was the attempt of the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a> Strauss to explain away the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> element in the Gospels as the mythical fancies of an age much later than that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Strauss's views, embodied in his "Life of Jesus" (1835), were ably refuted, together with the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> assertions and inductions of the T&uuml;bingen School by such <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars as <a href="../cathen/08703a.htm">Kuhn</a>, <a href="../cathen/07515a.htm">Hug</a>, Sepp, <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, and by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> critics, Ewald, Meyer, Wieseler, Tholuck, Luthardt, and others. The outcome of Strauss's "Life of Jesus," and of Renan's vain attempt to improve on it by giving it a legendary form (Vie de J&eacute;sus, 1863), has been a number of scholarly biographies of our blessed Lord: by <a href="../cathen/06156b.htm">Fouard</a>, "Christ the Son of God" (New York, 1891); <a href="../cathen/04782a.htm">Didon</a>, "Jesus Christ" (New York, 1891); Edersheim, "Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah" (New York, 1896), and others.

<p>Another field of study which grew up chiefly in the last century, and has had an influence in shaping the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of apologetics, is the study of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. The study of the great religious systems of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> world, and their comparison with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, furnished material for a number of specious arguments against the independent and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> origin of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. So, too, the study of the origin of religion in the light of the religious philosophy of uncultured peoples has been exploited against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> (theistic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>) on the unwarranted ground that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is but a refinement, through a long process of evolution, of a crude primitive religion originating in ghost-worship. Among those who have distinguished themselves in this branch of apologetics are <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, whose "Heidenthum und Judenthum" (1857), tr. "Gentile and Jew in the Court of the Temple" (London, 1865-67), is a mine of information on the comparative merits of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> of the Roman world; Abb&eacute; de Broglie, author of the suggestive volume, "Probl&egrave;mes et conclusions de l'histoire des religions" (Paris, 1886); Hardwick, Christ and other Masters" (London, 1875). Another factor in the growth of apologetics during the last century was the rise of numerous systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> that, in the teaching of such men as <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, Fichte, <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, Schelling, Comte, and Spencer, were openly or covertly in opposition to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. To counteract these systems, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> revived throughout the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> philosophy. The many works written to vindicate <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Theism</a> against <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a>, Positivism, and Evolutionary Monism have been of great service to apologetics. Not all these philosophic apologies, indeed, are scholastic. They represent several modern <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of thought. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> has furnished a number of able apologetic thinkers who lay chief stress on the subjective element in man, who point to the needs and aspirations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and to the corresponding fitness of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> alone, to satisfy them. This line of thought has been worked out in various ways by the lately deceased Oll&eacute;-Laprune, author of "La certitude morale" (Paris, 1880), and "Le prix de la vie" (Paris, 1892); by Fonsegrive, "Le catholicisme et la vie de l'esprit" (Paris, 1899); and, in "L'action" (Paris, 1893), by Blondel, the founder of the so-called "Immanence School" the principles of which are embodied in the spiritual writings of Father Tyrrell, "Lex Orandi" (London, 1903), "Lex Credendi" (London, 1906). The continued opposition between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in the last century resulted in the production of a number of noteworthy apologetic writings: M&ouml;hler, "Symbolism", published in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1832, which has gone through many editions in English; <a href="../cathen/02224b.htm">Balmes</a>, "Protestantism and Catholicity Compared in their Effects on the Civilization of Europe", a Spanish work published in English in 1840 (Baltimore); the works of the three illustrious <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a>, <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>, most of whose writings have a bearing on apologetics.

<p>It is out of all these varied and extensive studies that apologetics has taken form. The vastness of the field makes it extremely difficult for any one writer to do it full <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. In fact a complete, comprehensive apology of uniform excellence still remains to be written.
