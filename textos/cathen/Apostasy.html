<h1>Apostasy</h1>  

<p>(<em>apo</em>, from, and <em>stasis</em>, station, standing, or position).

<p>The word itself in its etymological sense, signifies the desertion of a post, the giving up of a state of life; he who <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> embraces a definite state of life cannot leave it, therefore, without becoming an apostate. Most authors, however, distinguish with <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (De Synodo di&#163;cesan&acirc;, XIII, xi, 9), between three kinds of apostasy: apostasy <em>a Fide</em> or <em>perfidi&#163;,</em> when a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> gives up his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; apostasy <em>ab ordine,</em> when a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> abandons the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>; apostasy <em>a religione,</em> or <em>monachatus,</em> when a religious leaves the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. The Gloss on title 9 of the fifth book of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gregory IX mentions two other kinds of apostasy: apostasy <em>inobedienti&aelig;,</em> disobedience to a command given by lawful authority, and <em>iteratio baptismatis,</em> the repetition of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, "quoniam reiterantes baptismum videntur apostatare dum recedunt a priori baptismate". As all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> involves disobedience, the apostasy <em>inobedienti&aelig;</em> does not constitute a specific offense. In the case of <em>iteratio baptismatis,</em> the offence falls rather under the head of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and irregularity than of apostasy; if the latter name has sometimes been given to it, it is due to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gregory IX combine into one title, under the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> "De apostatis et reiterantibus baptisma" (V, title 9) the two distinct titles of the Justinian Code: "Ne sanctum baptisma iteretur" and "De apostatis" (I, titles 6, 7), in Corpus juris civilis ed. Krueger, (Berlin, 1888); II 60-61. See M&uuml;nchen "Das kanonische Gerichtsverfahren und Strafrecht" (Cologne, 1874), II, 362, 363. Apostasy, in its strictest sense, means apostasy <em>a Fide</em> (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, Summa theologica, II-II, Q. xii a. 1).
<h2>Apostasy <em>a fide</em>, or <em>perfidi&aelig;</em></h2>

<p>Perfidi&aelig; is the complete and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> abandonment of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, whether the apostate embraces another religion such as <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a>, <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, etc., or merely makes profession of <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">Naturalism</a>, <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, etc. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> differs from the apostate in that he only denies one or more of the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>, whereas the apostate denies the religion itself, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which has always been looked upon as one of the most grievous. The "Shepherd" of Hermas, a work written in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the middle of the second century, states positively that there is no forgiveness for those who have wilfully denied the Lord. [Similit. ix. 26, 5; Funk, Opera Patrum apostolicorum (T&uuml;bingen, 1887), I, 547]. Apostasy belonged, therefore, to the class of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> imposed perpetual penance and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> without hope of pardon, leaving the forgiveness of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. After the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (249, 250), however, the great numbers of <em><a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">Lapsi</a></em> and <em>Libellatici,</em> and the claims of the <em>Martyres</em> or <em>Confessores,</em> who assumed the right of remitting the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of apostasy by giving the <em><a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">Lapsi</a></em> a letter of communion, led to a relaxation of the rigour of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of the African Church</a> which met at Carthage in 251 admitted the principle of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> right to remit the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of apostasy, even before the hour of death. <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> and the council which he held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> confirmed the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Synod of Carthage</a>, and the discipline of forgiveness was gradually introduced into all the Churches. [Epistol&aelig; S. Cypriani, 55 et 68; Corpus scriptorum ecclesiasticorum latinorum (Vienna, 1871), III, ii, ed. Hartel, 624, 666; Eusebius, Church History, VI, xliii, 1, 2]. Nevertheless, the Council of Elvira, held in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> about the year 300, still refused forgiveness to apostates. [Harduin, Acta Conciliorum (Paris, 1715), I,&uacute; Funk, Kirchen-geschichtliche Abhandlungen und Untersuchungen (Paderborn, 1897), I, 155-181; Batiffol, Etudes d'histoire et de th&eacute;ologie positive (Paris, 1902) 1st series, 111-144]. When the Roman Empire became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, apostates were punished by deprivation of all civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. They could not give evidence in a court of law, and could neither bequeath nor inherit <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. To induce anyone to apostatize was an offence punishable with death [Theodosian Code, XVI, title 7, <em>De apostatis;</em> title 8, <em>De Jud&aelig;is; </em>"Corpus juris romani ante-Justinian&aelig;i" (Bonn, 1840), 1521 - 1607; Code of Justinian I, title 7, <em>De apostatis</em> l. c. 60, 61]. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, both civil and canon law classed apostates with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; so much so that title 9 of the fifth book of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gregory IX, which treats of apostasy, contains only a secondary provision concerning apostasy <em>a Fide</em> [iv, Friedberg, Corpus juris canonici (Leipzig, 1879-81), II, 790-792]. <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> however, by a provision which was amended in the sixth book of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> [V, title 2, <em>De h&#163;reticis,</em> 13 (Friedberg, II, 1075)], merely classes apostates with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in respect of the penalties which they incur. This <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a>, which only mentions apostate <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by name, was applied indifferently to all. The <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> could therefore proceed against them. The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> was directed, at the end of the fifteenth century, chiefly against apostates, the <em>Maranos, </em>or new <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> converted by force rather than by conviction; while in 1609 it dealt severely with the <em>Moriscos</em>, or professedly-converted <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.



<p>Today the temporal penalties formerly inflicted on apostates and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot be enforced, and have fallen into abeyance. The spiritual penalties are the same as those which apply to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. In order, however, to incur these penalties, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in accordance with the general principles of canon law, that the apostasy should be shown in some way. Apostates, with all who receive, protect, or befriend them, incur <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, reserved <em>speciali modo</em> to the Sovereign Pontiff (Constitution <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">Apostolic&aelig; Sedis</a>, n&deg; 1). They incur, moreover, the note of "infamy", at least when their apostasy is <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>, and are "irregular"; an <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> and an irregularity which extend to the son and the grandson of an apostate father, and to the son of an apostate mother, should the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> die without being reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> [<a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of Gratian, Distinction L, xxxii; V, tit. 2, ii, xv of the sixth book of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> (Friedberg, I, 191, II, 1069 and 1075)]. Most authors, however, are of opinion that the irregularity affects only the children of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who have joined some particular <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, or who have been personally condemned by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority [Gasparri, De sacr&acirc; ordinatione (Paris, 1893), II, 288 and 294; Lehmkuhl, Theologia moralis (Freiburg im Br., 1898), II, 725; Wernz, Jus decretalium (Rome, 1899), II, 200; Hollweck, Die kirchlichen Strafgesetze (Mainz, 1899), 162]. Apostates are debarred from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> burial (Decretals of Gregory IX, Bk. V, title 7, viii, Friedberg, II, 779). Any writings of theirs, in which they uphold <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, or labour to undermine the foundations of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, are on the Index, and those who read them incur the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> reserved, <em>speciali modo</em> to the Sovereign Pontiff [Constitution of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, Officiorum et munerum, 25 January, 1897, i, v; Vermeersch, De prohibitione et censur&acirc; librorum (Rome, 1901), 3d ed., 57, 112]. Apostasy constitutes an impediment to marriage, and the apostasy of husband or wife is a sufficient reason for separation <em>a thoro et cohabitatione,</em> which, according to many authorities, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunal may make perpetual [<a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gregory IX, IV, title 19, vi; (Friedberg, II, p. 722) ]. Others, however, maintain that this separation cannot be perpetual unless the innocent party embraces the religious state [<a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gregory IX, ibidem, vii (Friedberg, II 722). See Gasparri, "Tractatus canonicus de matrimonio" (Paris, 1891), II, 283; De Becker, "De matrimonio" (Louvain, 1903), 2d ed., 424]. In the case of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, apostasy involves the loss of all dignities, offices, and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and even of all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> privileges (Decretals of Gregory IX. V, title 7, ix, xiii. See Hollweck, 163, 164).
<h2>Apostasy <em>ab ordine</em></h2>

<p>This, according to the present <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, is the abandonment of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> dress and state by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who have received major orders. Such, at least, is the definition given of it by most authorities. The ancient <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, though it did not forbid the marriage of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, did not allow them to abandon the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> of their own will, even if they had only received <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> threatens with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> all deserting <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> without distinction (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> II, 603). This discipline, often infringed indeed, endured throughout a great part of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a> decreed, at the Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1049): "Ne quis monachus vel clericus a suo gradu apostataret", all <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and clerks are forbidden to abandon their state (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> VI, 1007). The <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gregory IX, published in 1234, preserve traces of the older discipline under the title <em>De apostatis,</em> which forbids all clerks, without distinction, to abandon their state [V, title 9, i, iii (Friedberg, II, 790-791) ]. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> had however, at an earlier date, given permission to clerks in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> to quit the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> of their own will (Decretals of Gregory IX, III, title 3, vii; see also x, Friedberg, II, 458-460). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> did not restore the ancient <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, but deemed it sufficient to command the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to exercise great <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in bestowing the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, and only laid the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> involved in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state on clerks who have received major orders and on those who enjoy an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> (Session XXIII, <em>De Reformatione</em>, iv, vi). Whence it follows that all other clerks can quit their state, but, by the very fact of doing so, lose all the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Even the clerk in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> who enjoys an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a>, should he wish to be laicized, loses his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> by the very fact of his laicization, a loss which is to be regarded not as the penalty, but as the consequence, of his having abandoned the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. These considerations suffice, it would seem, to refute the opinion maintained by some writers [Hinschius, System des Katholischen Kirchenrechts (Berlin, 1895), V, 905], who think that a clerk in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> can, even at the present day, be an apostate <em>ab ordine.</em> This opinion is rejected, among others, by <a href="../cathen/13527c.htm">Scherer</a>, [Handbuch des Kirchenrechtes (Gratz, 1886), I, 313; Wernz, II, 338, note 24; Hollweck, 299].

<p>Today, after three ineffectual notices, the apostate clerk loses, <em>ipso facto,</em> the privileges of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> [<a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gregory IX, V, title 9, i; title 39, xxiii, xxv (Friedberg, II, 790 and 897)]. By the very fact of apostasy he incurs <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, which, however is only an <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> of fact, not one of law imposed by canonical legislation. <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">Infamy</a> involves irregularity, and is an offense punishable by the loss of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. Finally, should the apostate persist in his apostasy, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> him [Constit. of <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, Apostolic&aelig; ecclesi&aelig; regimine, 2 May, 1725, in Bullarum amplissima collectio (Rome, 1736), XI, ii, 400].
<h2>Apostasy <em>a religione</em>, or <em>monachatus</em></h2>

<p>Monachatus is the culpable departure of a religious from his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with the intention of not returning to it and of withdrawing himself from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, therefore, who leaves his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with the intention of returning is not an apostate, but a runaway, and so is the one who leaves it intending to enter another <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> made no <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> always continuing to live the ascetic life upon which they had entered. The rule of <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a>, the father of the c&#163;nobitical life, allowed the religious to leave his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> [Ladenze, Histoire du c&eacute;nobitisme pakhomien (Louvain, 1898), 285]. But from the fourth century onwards the religious state became perpetual, and in 385 <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a>, in his letter to Himerius, expresses indignation against religious men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who were unfaithful to their <em>propositum sanctitatis</em> (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> I, 848, 849). The <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> decreed that the religious who desired to return to the world should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and the Second <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> called him an apostate (<a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> II, 602, 603, 775). Throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> numerous councils and <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> insisted on this perpetuity of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">Peter Damian</a> was one of the great champions (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXLV, 674-678). <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, at the time of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, instituted very strict legislation against apostates by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Postquam.,</em> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 20 July, 1558. These provisions were, however, recalled, two years later, by <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, in the Constitution, <em>Sedis apostolic&aelig;, of</em> 3 April, 1560 (Bullarum amplissima collectio [<a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1745], IV, i, 343, and IV, ii, 10).

<p>As the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> stands today, the canonical penalties are inflected only upon apostates in the strict sense, that is, those professed with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, with whom <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> scholastics are classed by privilege. Religious belonging to congregations with only simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, therefore, and those with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in orders which also take solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, do not incur these penalties. 1. Apostasy is a grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of which the superior may reserve to himself [<a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Sanctissimus" of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, 26 May, 1593, "Bullarum ampl. Collectio" (Rome, 1756), V, v, 254]. 2. The religious is <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspended</a> from the exercise of all orders which he may have received during the period of his apostasy, nor is this penalty removed by his return to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> [<a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gregory IX, V, title 9, vi (Friedberg, II, 792)]. 3. He is bound by all the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> laid on him by his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and the constitutions of his order, but if he has laid aside the religious habit, and if a judicial sentence has pronounced his deposition, he loses all the privileges of his order, in particular that of exemption from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ordinary and the right of being supported at the expense of his community (Council of Trent, Session XXV, <em>de regularibus</em>, xix). 4. The fact of laving aside the religious habit involves the penalty of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> [III tit. 24, ii, of the sixth book of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> (Friedberg II, 1065)]. 5. In several <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders apostates incur the penalty of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, even when they have not laid aside the religious habit, in virtue of special privileges granted to the order. 6. The apostate is bound to return to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> as soon as possible, and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> enjoins <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to punish religious who shall have left their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> without the permission of their superiors, as deserters (Session XXV, <em>de regularibus</em>, iv). Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is bound to take possession of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the apostate <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and to send him back to his superior [<a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Congregation of the Council, 21 September, 1624, in "Bullarum amplissima collectio" (Rome, 1756), V, v, 248]. In the case of an apostate <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> who leaves a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> enjoying pontifical <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, she incurs the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> reserved <em>simpliciter</em> to the Sovereign Pontiff [Constitution <em><a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">Apostolic&aelig; Sedis</a></em>, n&deg; 6. See Vermeersch, "De religiosis institutis et personis" (Rome, 1902), I, 200; Hollweck, 299; Scherer, II, 838.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">In addition to the works already referred to, the older canonists may be consulted, especially SCHMALZGR&Uuml;BER and REIFFENSTUEL, who in their commentaries follow the order of the Decretals, at Book V, title 9. As modern canonists no longer treat of apostasy under a special heading, they must be consulted where they refer to ordinations and irregularities, the duties of the clerical state, the obligations of religious offenses and penalties, and, chiefly, when they write concerning heresy.
