<h1>Apostles' Creed</h1>  

<p>A formula containing in brief statements, or "articles," the fundamental tenets of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and having for its authors, according to <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles.</a>
<h2 id="section1">Origin of the creed</h2>

<p>Throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was generally <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, on the day of Pentecost, while still under the direct inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, composed our present <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> between them, each of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> contributing one of the twelve articles. This legend dates back to the sixth century (see Pseudo-Augustine in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XXXIX, 2189, and Pirminius, ibid., LXXXIX, 1034), and it is foreshadowed still earlier in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a> attributed to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XVII, 671; Kattenbusch, I, 81), which takes notice that the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> was "pieced together by twelve separate workmen". About the same date (c. 400) <a href="../cathen/13221b.htm">Rufinus</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XXI, 337) gives a detailed account of the composition of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>, which account he professes to have received from earlier ages (<em>tradunt majores nostri</em>). Although he does not explicitly assign each article to the authorship of a separate <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>, he states that it was the joint work of all, and implies that the deliberation took place on the day of Pentecost. Moreover, he declares that "they for many just reasons decided that this <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> should be called the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Symbol</a>", which Greek word he explains to mean both <em>indicium</em>, i.e. a token or password by which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> might recognize each other, and <em>collatio</em>, that is to say an offering made up of separate contributions. A few years before this (c. 390), the letter addressed to <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> by the Council of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XVI, 1213) supplies the earliest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> instance of the combination <em>Symbolum Apostolorum</em> ("Creed of the Apostles") in these striking words: "If you credit not the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> . . . let credit at least be given to the Symbol of the Apostles which the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> always preserves and maintains inviolate." The word <em>Symbolum</em> in this sense, standing alone, meets us first about the middle of the third century in the correspondence of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> and <a href="../cathen/06080b.htm">St. Firmilia</a>, the latter in particular speaking of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> as the "Symbol of the Trinity", and recognizing it as an integral part of the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., III, 1165, 1143). It should be added, moreover, that Kattenbusch (II, p. 80, note) <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that the same use of the words can be traced as far back as <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. Still, in the first two centuries after Christ, though we often find mention of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> under other designations (e.g. <em>regula fidei, doctrina, traditio</em>), the name <em>symbolum</em> does not occur. <a href="../cathen/13221b.htm">Rufinus</a> was therefore wrong when he declared that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> themselves had "for many just reasons" selected this very term. This fact, joined with the intrinsic improbability of the story, and the surprising silence of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and of the Ante-Nicene Fathers, leaves us no choice but to regard the circumstantial narrative of <a href="../cathen/13221b.htm">Rufinus</a> as unhistorical.

<p>Among recent critics, some have assigned to the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> an origin much later than the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age. Harnack, e.g., asserts that in its present form it represents only the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> confession of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Southern Gaul, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> at earliest from the second half of the fifth century (Das apostolische Glaubensbekenntniss, 1892, p. 3). Strictly construed, the terms of this statement are accurate enough; though it seems probable that it was not in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> really assumed its final shape (see Burn in the "Journal of Theol. Studies", July, 1902). But the stress laid by Harnack on the lateness of our received text (T) is, to say the least, somewhat misleading. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, as Harnack allows, that another and older form of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> (R) had come into existence, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself, before the middle of the second century. Moreover, as we shall see, the differences between R and T are not very important and it is also probable that R, if not itself drawn up by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, is at least based upon an outline which dates back to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> age. Thus, taking the document as a whole, we may say confidently, in the words of a modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> authority, that "in and with our <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> we confess that which since the days of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> has been the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of united <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>" (Zahn, Apostles' Creed, tr., p, 222). The question of the <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolicity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> ought not to be dismissed without due attention being paid to the following five considerations:

<p>(1) There are very suggestive traces in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> of the recognition of a certain "form of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>" (<em>typos didaches</em>, <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#vrs17">Romans 6:17</a>) which moulded, as it were, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of new <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and which involved not only the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the heart, but "with the mouth confession made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#vrs8">Romans 10:8-10</a>). In close connection with this we must recall the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> exacted of the eunuch (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs37">Acts 8:37</a>) as a preliminary to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (Augustine, "De Fide et Operibus", cap. ix; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LVII, 205) and the formula of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself in the name of the Three Persons of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a> (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs19">Matthew 28:19</a>; and cf. the <a href="../fathers/0714.htm#chapter7"><em>Didache</em> 7:2</a>, and <a href="../fathers/0714.htm#chapter9">9:5</a>). Moreover, as soon as we begin to obtain any sort of detailed description of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonial</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we find that, as a preliminary to the actual immersion, a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was exacted of the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a>, which exhibits from the earliest times a clearly divided and separate confession of Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, corresponding to the Divine Persons invoked in the formula of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. As we do not find in any earlier document the full form of the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we cannot be sure that it is identical with our <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>, but, on the other hand, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that nothing has yet been discovered which is inconsistent with such a supposition. See, for example, the "Canons of Hippolytus" (c. 220) or the "Didascalia" (c. 250) in Hahn's "Bibliothek der Symbole" (8, 14, 35); together with the slighter allusions in <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>.


<p>(2) Whatever difficulties may be raised regarding the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the <em><a href="../cathen/05032a.htm">Disciplina Arcani</a></em> in early times (Kattenbusch, II, 97 sqq.), there can be no question that in <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, Hilary, Augustine, Leo, the Gelasian Sacramentary, and many other sources of the fourth and fifth centuries the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is greatly insisted upon; that according to ancient <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> was to be learned by heart, and never to be consigned to writing. This undoubtedly provides a plausible explanation of the fact that in the case of no primitive <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a> is the text preserved to us complete or in a continuous form. What we know of these formulae in their earliest state is derived from what we can piece together from the quotations, more or less scattered, which are found in such writers, for example, as <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> and <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>.

<p>(3) Though no uniform type of <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> can be surely recognized among the earlier <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> writers before the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, an argument which has been considered by many to disprove the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of any <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> formula, it is a striking fact that the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> in the fourth century are found in possession of a <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> which reproduces with variations the old Roman type. This fact is full admitted by such <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> authorities as Harnack (in Hauck's Realencyclop&auml;die, I, 747) and Kattenbusch (I, 380 sq.; II, 194 sqq., and 737 sq.). It is obvious that these data would harmonize very well with the theory that a primitive <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> had been delivered to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, either by Sts. Peter and Paul themselves or by their immediate <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a>, and in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> had spread throughout the world.

<p>(4) Furthermore note that towards the end of the second century we can extract from the writings of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> in southern Gaul and of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> in far-off <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> two almost complete <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creeds</a>  agreeing closely both with the old Roman <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> (R), as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it from <a href="../cathen/13221b.htm">Rufinus</a>, and with one another. It will be useful to translate from Burn (Introduction to the Creeds, pp. 50, 51) his tabular presentation of the evidence in the case of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. (Cf. MacDonald in "Ecclesiastical Review", February, 1903):

<p>Such a table serves admirably to show how incomplete is the evidence provided by mere quotations of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>, and how cautiously it must be dealt with. Had we possessed only the <a href="../fathers/0403.htm">"De Virginibus Velandis"</a>, we might have said that the article concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> did not form part of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>. Had the <a href="../fathers/0403.htm">"De Virginibus Velandis"</a> been destroyed, we should have declared that <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of the clause "suffered under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>". And so forth.

<p>(5) It must not be forgotten that while no explicit statement of the composition of a formula of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> is forthcoming before the close of the fourth century, earlier Fathers such as <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> insist in a very emphatic way that the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">"rule of faith"</a> is part of the <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolic tradition</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> in particular in his <a href="../fathers/0311.htm">"De Praescriptione"</a>, after showing that by this rule (<em>regula doctrinoe</em>) he understands something practically identical with our <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>, insists that the rule was instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and delivered to us (<em>tradita</em>) as from Christ by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>. P.L., II, 26, 27, 33, 50). As a conclusion from this evidence the present writer, agreeing on the whole with such authorities as Semeria and Batiffol that we cannot safely affirm the <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> composition of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>, considers at the same time that to deny the possibility of such origin is to go further than our data at present warrant. A more pronouncedly conservative view is urged by MacDonald in the "Ecclesiastical Review", January to July, 1903.
<h2 id="section2">The old Roman creed</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Catechism of the Council of Trent</a> apparently assumes the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> origin of our existing <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>, but such a pronouncement has no <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> force and leaves opinion free. Modern <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologists</a>, in defending the claim to <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolicity</a>, extend it only to the old Roman form (R), and are somewhat hampered by the objection that if R had been really held to be the inspired utterance of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, it would not have been modified at pleasure by various local churches (<a href="../cathen/13221b.htm">Rufinus</a>, for example, testifies to such expansion in the case of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>), and in particular would never have been entirely supplanted by T, our existing form. The difference between the two will best be seen by printing them side by side (Creeds R and T): <table summary="Table"> <tr> <td><strong>R.</strong></td> <td><strong>T.</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(1) I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father Almighty</a>;</td> <td>(1) I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father Almighty</a> <em>Creator of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and earth</em></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(2) And in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, His only Son, our Lord;</td> <td>(2) And in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, His only Son, our Lord;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(3) Who was born of (de) the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and of (ex) the Virgin Mary;</td> <td>(3) Who was <em>conceived</em> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, born of the Virgin Mary,</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(4) Crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> and buried;</td> <td>(4) <em>Suffered</em> under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, was crucified, <em>dead</em>, and buried;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(5) The third day He <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rose again from the dead</a>,</td> <td>(5) <em>He descended into <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">hell</a></em>; the third day He <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rose again from the dead</a>;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(6) He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into Heaven</a>,</td> <td>(6) He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into Heaven</a>, sitteth at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm"><em>God</em></a> the Father <em>Almighty</em>;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(7) Sitteth at the right hand of the Father,</td> <td>(7) From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(8) Whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.</td> <td>(8) <em>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a></em> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(9) And in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</td> <td>(9) The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Holy</a> <em>Catholic</em> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <em>the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a></em></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(10) The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">Holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,</td> <td>(10) The forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(11) The forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;</td> <td>(11) The <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>, and</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(12) The <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>.</td> <td>(12) <em>life everlasting.</em></td> </tr> </table>

<p>Neglecting minor points of difference, which indeed for their adequate discussion would require a study of the Latin text, we may note that R does not contain the clauses "Creator of heaven and earth", "descended into <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">hell</a>", "the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a>", "life everlasting", nor the words "conceived", "suffered", "died", and "Catholic". Many of these additions, but not quite all, were probably <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> in Palestine (c. 380.--See Morin in Revue Benedictine, January, 1904) and about the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatian</a>, Niceta (Burn, Niceta of Remesiana, 1905). Further additions appear in the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creeds</a> of southern Gaul at the beginning of the next century, but T probably assumed its final shape in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself some time before A.D. 700 (Burn, Introduction, 239; and Journal of Theol. Studies, July, 1902). We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> as to the reasons which led to the adoption of T in preference to R.
<h2 id="section3">Articles of the creed</h2>

<p>Although T really contains more than twelve articles, it has always been customary to maintain the twelvefold division which originated with, and more strictly applies to, R. A few of the more debated items call for some brief comment. The first article of R presents a difficulty. From the language of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> it is contended that R originally omitted the word <em>Father</em> and added the word <em>one</em>; thus, "I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God Almighty</a>". Hence Zahn infers an underlying Greek original still partly surviving in the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>, and holds that the first article of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> suffered modification to counteract the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. It must suffice to say here that although the original language of R may possibly be Greek, Zahn's premises regarding the wording of the first article are not accepted by such authorities as Kattenbusch and Harnack.

<p>Another textual difficulty turns upon the inclusion of the word <em>only</em> in the second article; but a more serious question is raised by Harnack's refusal to recognize, either in the first or second article of R, any acknowledgment of a pre-existent or <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> relation of Sonship and Fatherhood of the Divine Persons. The Trinitarian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of later ages, he declares, has read into the text a meaning which it did not possess for its framers. And he says, again, with regard to the ninth article, that the writer of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> did not conceive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a>, but as a power and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a>. "No <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> can be shown that about the middle of the second century the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">Person</a>." It is impossible to do more here than direct the reader to such <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> answers as those of Baumer and Blume; and among <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> to the very convenient volume of Swete. To quote but one illustration of early <a href="../cathen/11560a.htm">patristic</a> teaching, St. Ignatius at the end of the first century repeatedly refers to a Sonship which lies beyond the limits of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> . . . came forth from one Father", "was with the Father before the world was" (<a href="../fathers/0105.htm"><em>Letter to the Magnesians</em> 6-7</a>). While, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a> at a still earlier <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> writes: "As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> lives, and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> lives, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>" (cap. lviii). This and other like passages clearly indicate the <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a> of a distinction between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> analogous to that recognized to <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">exist</a> between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>. A similar appeal to early writers must be made in connection with the third article, that affirming the <a href="../cathen/15448a.htm">Virgin Birth</a>. Harnack admits that the words "conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (T), really add nothing to the "born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (R). He admits consequently that "at the beginning of the second century the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15448a.htm">miraculous conception</a> had become an established part of Church tradition". But he denies that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> formed part of the earliest Gospel preaching, and he thinks it consequently impossible that the article could have been formulated in the first century. We can only answer here that the burden of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> rests with him, and that the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a>, as quoted by Swete and others, points to a very different conclusion.

<p>Rufinus (c. 400) explicitly states that the words <em>descended into <a href="../cathen/09256a.htm">hell</a></em> were not in the Roman <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>, but existed in that of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. They are also in some Greek <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creeds</a> and in that of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, lately recovered by Morin. It was no doubt a remembrance of <a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#vrs19">1 Peter 3:19</a>, as interpreted by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> and others, which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> their insertion. The clause, <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">"communion of saints"</a>, which appears first in Niceta and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, should unquestionably be regarded as a mere expansion of the article "holy <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". <em>Saints</em>, as used here, originally meant no more than the living members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see the article by Morin in Revue d'histoire et de litterature ecclesiastique. May, 1904, and the monograph of J.P. Kirsch, Die Lehre von der Gemeinschaft der Heiligen, 1900). For the rest we can only note that the word "Catholic", which appears first in Niceta, is dealt with separately; and that "forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" is probably to be understood primarily of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and should be compared with the "one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" of the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Use and authority of the creed</h2>

<p>As already indicated, we must turn to the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">ritual</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Baptism</a> for the most primitive and important use of the Apostles' Creed. It is highly probable that the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> was originally nothing else than a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> formula. The fully developed <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonial</a> which we find in the seventh Roman Ordo, and the Gelasian Sacramentary, and which probably represented the practice of the fifth century, assigns a special day of "scrutiny", for the imparting of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> (<em>traditio symboli</em>), and another, immediately before the actual administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacrament</a>, for the <em>redditio symboli</em>, when the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a> gave <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his proficiency by reciting the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> aloud. An imposing address accompanied the <em>traditio</em> and in an important article, Dom de Puniet (Revue d'Histoire Ecclesiastique, October, 1904) has recently shown that this address is almost certainly the composition of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a>. Further, three questions (<em>interrogationes</em>) were put to the candidate in the very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which questions are themselves only a summary of the oldest form of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a>. Both the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> and the questions are still retained in the <em>Ordo baptizandi</em> of our actual <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman ritual</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> in an interrogative form appears also in the Baptismal Service of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Anglican "Book of Common Prayer"</a>. Outside of the administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the Apostles' Creed is recited daily in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not only at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="../cathen/12424a.htm">Prime</a> and the end of <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>, but also ferially in the course of <a href="../cathen/12424a.htm">Prime</a> and <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> enjoin that it must be learnt by all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and there is a great deal of evidence to show that, even in such countries as <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, it was formerly learnt in Latin. As a result of this intimate association with the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> and teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Apostles' Creed has always been held to have the authority of an <em><a href="../cathen/05677a.htm">ex cathedra</a></em> utterance. It is commonly taught that all points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> contained in it are part of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and cannot be called in question under pain of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="../summa/3001.htm#article9">Summa Theologica, II-II:1:9</a>). Hence <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have generally been content to accept the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> in the form, and in the sense, in which it has been authoritatively expounded by the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">living voice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who accept it only in so far as it represents the evangelical teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age, it became a matter of supreme importance to investigate its original form and meaning. This explains the preponderating amount of research devoted to this subject by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> scholars as compared with the contributions of their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rivals.
