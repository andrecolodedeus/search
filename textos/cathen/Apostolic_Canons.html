<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Apostolic Canons</h1>  

<p>A collection of ancient <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">ecclesiastical decrees</a> (eighty-five in the Eastern, fifty in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>) concerning the government and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitutions</a> (VIII, 47).

<p>They deal mostly with the office and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Christian bishop</a>, the qualifications and conduct of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian flock</a> (abstinence, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>), its external administration (<a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunucation</a>, <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, relations with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>), the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (Baptism, Eucharist, Marriage); in a word, they are a handy summary of the statutory legislation of the primitive Church. The last of these decrees contains a very important list or canon of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> (see CANON OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES under sub-title <em>Canon of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a></em>). In the original Greek text they claim to be the very legislation of the Apostles themselves, at least as <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by their great disciple, Clement. Nevertheless, though a venerable mirror of ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life and blameless in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, their claim to genuine Apostolic origin is quite <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and untenable. Some, like Beveridge and Hefele, believe that they were originally drawn up about the end of the second or the beginning of the third century. Most modern critics agree that they could not have been composed before the Council of Antioch (341), some twenty of whose canons they quote; nor even before the latter end of the fourth century, since they are certainly posterior to the Apostolic Constitutions. Von Funk, admittedly a foremost authority on the latter and all similar early canonical texts, locates the composition of the Apostolic Canons in the fifth century, near the year 400. Thereby he approaches the opinion of his scholarly predecessor, Drey, the first among modern writers to study profoundly these ancient canons; he distinguished two editions of them, a shorter one (fifty) about the middle of the fifth century, and a longer one (eighty-five) early in the sixth century. Von Funk admits but one edition. They were certainly current in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> in the first quarter of the sixth century, for in about 520 Severus of Antioch quotes canons 21-23 [E. W. Brooks, "Select Letters of Severus of Antioch", London, 1904 (Syriac text), I, 463-64. For various opinions concerning the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of composition see F. Nau, in Dict. de th&eacute;ol. cath., II, 1607-8, and the new Fr. tr. of Hefele's "History of the Councils", Paris, 1907, 1206-11]. The home of the author seems to be <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. He makes use of the Syro-Macedonian calendar (can. 26), borrows very largely from a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> council (Antioch, 341), and according to Von Funk is identical with the compiler or interpolator of the Apostolic Constitutions, who was certainly a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> (Die apostol. Konstitutionen, 204-5).

<p>As just indicated the number of these canons has given rise to no little controversy. In the Apostolic Constitutions (loc. cit.) they are eighty-five (occasionally eighty-four, a variant in the Manuscripts that arises from the occasional counting of two canons as one). In the latter half of the sixth century, <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a> (Joannes Scholasticus), <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople from 565 to 577, published a collection of synodal decrees in which he included these eighty-five canons (see Justel-Voellus, Bibliotheca Juris Canonici veteris, Paris, 1661, II, 501), and this number was finally <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan or Quinisext Council</a> (692), which also confined the current Greek tradition of their Apostolic origin. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, recognized but fifty canons of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. This was the number finally adopted by <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>, who first translated these canons into Latin about 500. It is not very clear why he omitted canons 51-85; he seems to have been acquainted with them and to have used the Apostolic Constitutions. In reality Dionysius made three versions of the Apostolic Canons (the oldest of them first edited by C. H. Turner, Ecclesi&aelig; Occidentalis monumenta juris antiquissima, Oxford, 1899, fasc. I, 1-32); it is the second of these versions which obtained general <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> currency by its incorporation as the opening text of his famous Latin collection of canons (both synodal decrees and <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a>) known as the "Dionysiana Collectio" (P.L., LXVII, 9 sqq.), made public in the first decade of the sixth century. Later collections of canons (Italy, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, etc.) borrowed from him; the text passed into <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore</a>, and eventually Gratian Included (c. 1140) some excerpts from these canons in his "Decretum", whereby a universal recognition and use were gained for them in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. At a much earlier date Justinian (in his Sixth Novel) had recognized them as the work of the Apostles and confirmed them as ecclesiastical law. (For the Western references in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> see Von Funk, "Didascalia" etc. quoted below, II, 40-50, and for their insertion in the early Western collections of canons, <a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, "Gesch. der Quellen und Literatur des canonischen Rechts im Abendlande, Gratz, 1872, 438-40.) Nevertheless, from their first appearance in the West they aroused suspicion. Canon 46 for example, that rejected all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriously</a> opposed to Roman and Western practice. In the so-called "Decretum" of Pope Gelasius (429-96) they are denounced as an <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> book, i.e. not recognized by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Thiel, epistol&aelig; Rom. pontificum genuin&aelig;, 1867, I, 53-58, 454-71; Von Funk, op. cit., II, 40), though this note of censure was probably not in the original "Decretum", but with others was added under Pope Hormisdas (514-23). Consequently in a second edition (lost, except preface) of his "Collectio canonum", prepared under the latter <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a> omitted them; even in the first edition he admitted that very many in the West were loath to acknowledge them (<em>quamplurimi quidem assensum non pr&oelig;buere facilem</em>). <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a> (died 882) declared that they were not written by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and as late as the middle of the eleventh century, Western <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> (Cardinal Humbert, 1054) distinguished between the eighty-five Greek canons that they declared <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, and the fifty Latin canons recognized as "orthodox rules" by antiquity.

<p>The influence of the Apostolic Canons was greatly increased by the various versions of them soon current in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, East and West. We have already indicated the influence of the second Latin version of <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>. They were also translated (more or less fully) into Syriac, Arabic, Coptic, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>; in general they seem to have furnished during the fifth and sixth centuries a large element of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> (see the detailed description of the so-called "127 Copto-Arabic canons", by F. Nau in Dict. de th&eacute;ol. cath., II, 1612-19; also Funk, Die apostolischen Konstitutionen, <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>, 1891, and the articles <a href="../cathen/01635a.htm">APOSTOLIC CHURCH-ORDINANCE</a>, EGYPTIAN CHURCH-ORDINANCE, <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">DIDACHE</a>, <a href="../cathen/04781b.htm">DIDASCALIA APOSTOLORUM</a>). The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the (Greek) Apostolic Canons are described by Pitra, "Juris ecc. Gr&aelig;corum historia et monumenta", Rome, 1864, I, 3-4; the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the Latin versions of <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>, by C. H. Turner, op. cit. supra, fasc. I. p. 1; cf. Von Funk, "Didascalia et Constitutiones apostolorum", (Paderborn, 1906), I, xlviii-liv, also xxiv-xlviii. The fifty Latin canons were first printed in Jacques Merlin's edition of the Councils (Paris, 1524); the eighty-five Greek Canons by G. Holoander, in his edition of Justinian's Novels (Nuremberg, 1531), whence they made their way into the earlier editions of the "Corpus Juris Civilis", the "Corpus Juris Canonici", and the large collections of acts and decrees of the councils.

<p>A few other ancient canonical texts that pretend to Apostolic origin are described by F. Nau, op. cit., 1620-26; the most interesting of them is a brief collection of nine canons that purport to date from an imaginary Apostolic Council of Antioch. They may be read in Pitra, "Hist. et monumenta Juris eccl. Gr&aelig;corum" (Rome, 1864), I, 88-91; also in Lagarde, "Reliqui&aelig; juris eccl. antiquissim&aelig; gr&aelig;ce", 18-20, and in Harnack, "Mission und Ausbreitung" (Leipzig, 1902). They recommend the faithful not to practice <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, to admit the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to avoid Jewish and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> customs, the distinction of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean and unclean</a> foods, the worship of idols, the vices of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, frequentation of theatres, and taking of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">earliest Christian literature</a> offers numerous parallels to the content of these canons, which, in general, recall the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, the Epistle of Barnabas, and the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a>. In the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Turrianus (Torres) defended their authenticity, his chief argument being a reference of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> (401-17) to an Apostolic Council of Antioch (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, III, 1055). A notable literary controversy followed that is not yet quite closed (see Nau, op. cit., 1621-22). Interest centres chiefly in the first canon, which decrees that the Galileans shall henceforth be called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (see <a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs26">Acts 11:26</a>), a holy people, a royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (see <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs9">1 Peter 2:9</a>) according to the grace and title of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Some critics see in this canon a defiant reply to the contemptuous use of "Galileans" by <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> (Harnack, "Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums", Leipzig, 1902; Paul Lejay, in "Revue du clerg&eacute; fran&ccedil;ais", 15 Oct., 1903, 349-55, with a Fr. tr. of the nine canons). F. Nau is of opinion that they are much older than the latter quarter of the fourth century and calls attention (op. cit., 1624) to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (<a href="../fathers/04168.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> VIII.29</a> &#151; "it seemed good to the Apostles and the elders assembled at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and in their own words to the Holy Spirit to write a letter to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who believed"). This statement contradicts <a href="../bible/act015.htm">Acts 15:6-28</a>, according to which the Apostolic letter was written from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Nevertheless, it seems that this collection of canons was known to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, all the more as it claims (in the title) to come from the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> at C&aelig;sarea and to have been found there by the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, <a href="../cathen/11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a> (cf. Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.32.3</a>). F. Nau thinks that they may represent a personal rule of conduct drawn up by some second-century <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> (on the basis of Apostolic <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>) who miscopied <a href="../bible/act011.htm">Acts 11:26</a>, into the form of the afore-mentioned canon 1, and then added the other <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> &mdash; canon 9 reproduces the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../bible/act015.htm">Acts 15:29</a>. At any rate Dall&aelig;us (Daill&eacute;) was wrong in charging Turrianus with downright <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> of all these canons (De pseudepigraphis apostolicis libri tres, 1653, III, cc. xxii-xxv, pp. 687-737), and deliberate corruption of the text of <a href="../bible/psa016.htm#vrs14">Psalm 16:14</a>, "they are full of children" (<em>hyion</em>), making it read <em>hyieon</em> &mdash; i.e. "they are filled with pork". This reading of the fifth canon of Antioch is found not only in the oldest Latin <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalters</a>, and in other reliable fourth to sixth century Latin witnesses to the Scripture-text, but also in the best Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (<a href="../cathen/04086a.htm">Vaticanus</a>, <a href="../cathen/04085a.htm">Sinaiticus</a>). In other words the Scripture-text used by these canons antedates <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and is, in itself, an evidence of their great antiquity. (See <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">ANTIOCH</a>.)

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The critical text of the Apostolic Canons is that of the late IGNAZ VON FUNK, a monument of exact scholarship: <em>Didascalia et Constitutiones Apostolorum</em> (Paderborn, 1906, I, 565-95, with valuable notes. The best historical study of their origin and nature is also owing to VON FUNK, <em>Die apostolischen Konstitutionen</em> (Rottenburg, 1891), 180-206; IDEM, <em>Das achte Buck der apostolischen Konstitutionen und die verwandten Schriften</em> (T&uuml;bingen, 1893), and his <em>Kirchengeschichtliche Abhandlungen</em> (Paderborn, 1899, 1907), II, 369-72, III, 355 sqq. He was preceded in the nineteenth century by SEBASTIAN DREY (like Funk a professor of the Catholic faculty of theology in the University of T&uuml;bingen, where the study of these ancient texts has become an academic heirloom), <em>Neue Untersuchungen &uuml;ber die Constitutionen und Kanones der Apostel</em> (T&uuml;bingen, 1832), and by the learned J. W. BICKELL, <em>Gesch d. Kirckenrechts</em> (Giessen, 1843).</p><p class="cenotes">Among the older erudite researches into the history and study of the Apostolic Canons honour is due especially to the Anglican savant G. BEVERIDGE, <em>Synodicon sive Pandect&aelig; canonum sanctorum Apostolorum et conciliorum ab ecclesi&acirc; gr&aelig;c&acirc; receptorum</em> (Oxford, 1672-82; see P.G., CXXXVII, 36-217, For the Apostolic Canons, text and commentary of BEVERIDGE); JUSTEL, <em>Codex canonum ecclesi&aelig; univers&aelig; a Justiniano imperatore confirmatus . . . .
