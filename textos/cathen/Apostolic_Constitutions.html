<h1>Apostolic Constitutions</h1>  

<p>A fourth-century pseudo-Apostolic collection, in eight books, of independent, though closely related, treatises on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, worship, and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, intended to serve as a manual of guidance for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and to some extent for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>.

<p>Its tone is rather hortatory than preceptive, for, though it was evidently meant to be a code of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction and of moral and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> law, its injunctions often take the form of little treatises and exhortations, amply supported by scriptural texts and examples. Its elements are loosely combined without great regard for order or unity. It purports to be the work of the Apostles, whose instructions, whether given by them as <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> or as a body, are supposed to be gathered and handed down by the pretended compiler, <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a>, the authority of whose name gave fictitious weight to more than one such piece of early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> seems never to have regarded this work as of undoubted Apostolic authority. The <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan Council</a> in 692 rejected the work on account of the interpolations of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Only that portion of it to which has been given the name "Apostolic Canons" was received; but even the fifty of these canons which had then been accepted by the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> were not regarded as of certain Apostolic origin. Where known, however, the Apostolic Constitutions were held generally in high esteem and served as the basis for much <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation. They are today of the highest value as an historical document, revealing the moral and religious conditions and the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> observances of the third and fourth centuries.

<p>Their text was not known in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. In 1546 a Latin version of a text found in Crete was published by Capellus, and in 1563 appeared the complete Greek text of Bovius and that of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Father Torres (Turrianus) who, despite the glaring archaisms and incongruities of the collection, contended that it was a genuine work of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Four <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of it are now extant, the oldest an early twelfth-century text in St. Petersburg, an allied fourteenth-century text in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and two kindred sixteenth-century texts, one in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, the other in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In its present form the text represents the gradual growth and evolution of usages of the first three centuries of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> life. The compiler gathered from pre-existing moral, disciplinary, and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> codes the elements suited to his purpose, and by adaptation and interpolation framed a system of constitutions which, while suited to contemporary needs, could yet pretend, in an uncritical age, to Apostolic origin. Thanks to recent textual studies in early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature, most of the sources of which the compiler made use are now clearly recognizable. The first six books are based on the <a href="../cathen/04781b.htm">"Didascalia of the Apostles"</a>, a lost treatise of the third century, of Greek origin, which is known through Syriac versions. The compiler of the Apostolic Constitutions made use of the greater part of this older treatise, but he adapted it to the needs of his day by some modifications and extensive interpolation. Liturgical evolution made <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> a considerable amplification of the formul&aelig; of worship; changes in disciplinary practice called for a softening of some of the older <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; scriptural references and examples, intended to enforce the lessons inculcated by the Apostolic Constitutions, are more frequently used than in the parent Didascalia. The seventh book, which consists of two distinct parts, the first a moral instruction (i-xxxii) and the second <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> (xxxiii-xlix), depends for the first portion on the early second-century <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> or "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles", which has been amplified by the compiler in much the same manner as the Didascalia was amplified in the framing of the first six books. The rediscovery of the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> in 1873 revealed with what fidelity the compiler embodied it, almost word for word, in his expansion of its <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, save for such omissions and changes as were made <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the lapse of time. The fact that the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> was itself a source of the Didascalia will explain the repetition in the seventh book of the Apostolic Constitutions of matters treated in the preceding books. The source of the second portion of the seventh book is still undetermined. In the eighth book are recognized many distinct elements whose very number and diversity render it difficult to determine with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> the source upon which the compiler drew. The eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions may be divided into three parts thus: the introductory chapters (i-ii) have for their foundation a treatise entitled "Teaching of the Holy Apostles concerning Gifts", possibly a lost work of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>. The transitional third chapter is the work of the compiler. The last chapter (xlvii) contains the "Apostolic Canons". It is the second part (iv-xlvi) which presents difficulties the varied solution of which divides scholars as to its sources. Recent studies in early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature have made evident the kinship of several documents dealing with disciplinary and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> matters, closely allied with this eighth book. Their interdependence is not so clearly understood. The more important of these documents are: The "Canons of [pseudo?] <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>"; the <a href="../cathen/05363a.htm">"Egyptian Church Ordinance"</a>; and the recently discovered Syriac text of "The Gospel of Our Lord Jesus Christ". According to Dr. Hans Achelis, the "Canons of Hippolytus", which he considers to be a third-century document of Roman origin, is the parent of the <a href="../cathen/05363a.htm">"Egyptian Church Ordinance"</a>, and the contemporary practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would be the source from which the compiler of the Apostolic Constitutions drew. Dr. F. X. Funk, on the other hand, argues strongly for the priority of the eighth book of the latter, whence, through a parallel text, are derived the other three documents which he considers as fifth-century works, a conclusion not without its difficulties of acceptance, particularly with regard to the place of the "Canons of Hippolytus" in the <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>. If the priority of the Apostolic Constitutions be admitted, it is not easy to identify the sources on which the compiler depended. For the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> element (v-xv), which is an evident interpolation, the compiler may have been inspired by the practice of some particular church. The Antiochene "Diaconica" was not without some influence on him, and it may be that he had at hand other, now lost, ceremonial codes. It is not improbable that his Liturgy is even of his own creation and was never used in just the form in which he gives it. (See <a href="../cathen/01571a.htm">A<font size=-2>NTIOCHENE</font> L<font size=-2>ITURGY</font></a>).



<p>A study of the sources of this work suggests the many needs which the compiler endeavoured to meet in gathering together and amplifying these many treatises on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, discipline, and worship extant in his day. The extent and variety of his work may be suggested by a summary of the contents. The first book deals with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">Christian laity</a>, particularly in view of the dangers resulting from association with those not of the Faith. Vanity in dress, promiscuous bathing, curiosity as to the lives and the books of the wicked are among the things condemned. The second book is concerned principally with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The qualifications, the prerogatives and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> are set forth in detail, and their dependence and support provided for. This book treats at length of the regulation of penitential practice, of the caution to be observed in regard to accused and accusers, of the disputes of the faithful and the means of adjusting differences. This portion of the Apostolic Constitutions is of special interest, as portraying the penitential discipline and the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> system of the third and fourth centuries. Here are also a number of ceremonial details regarding the <a href="../cathen/14383a.htm">Christian assembly for worship</a> which, with the liturgy of the eighth book, are of the greatest importance and interest. The third book treats of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and of their office in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A consideration of what they should not do leads to a treatise on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The fourth book deals with charitable works, the providing for the poor and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and the spirit in which to receive and dispense the offerings made to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The fifth book treats of those suffering <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for the sake of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> towards them. This leads to a consideration of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Liturgical details as to feasts and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> follow. The sixth book deals with the history and doctrines of the early <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>; and of "The Law", a treatise against Judaistic and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> and uncleannesses. The seventh book in its first part is chiefly moral, condemning vices and praising <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virtues and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teachers. The second part is composed of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> directions and formul&aelig;. The eighth book is largely <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>. Chapters iii-xxvii treat of the conferring of all orders, and in connection with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is given in chapters v-xv the so-called Clementine Liturgy, the most ancient extant complete order of the rites of Holy Mass. Chapters xxviii-xlvi contain a collection of miscellaneous canons, moral and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, attributed to the various Apostles, while chapter xlvii consists of the eighty-five "Apostolic Canons".

<p>The strikingly characteristic style of the many interpolations in the Apostolic Constitutions makes it evident that the compilation, including the "Apostolic Canons", is the work of one individual. Who this Pseudo-Clement was cannot be conjectured; but it is now generally admitted that he is one with the interpolator of the Ignatian Epistles. As early as the middle of the seventeenth century, Archbishop Ussher, recognizing the similarity of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> thought, the peculiar use of Scripture, and the strongly marked literary characteristics in the Apostolic Constitutions and in both the interpolations of the seven epistles of Ignatius and the six spurious epistles attributed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, suggested the identification of the Pseudo-Clement with the Pseudo-Ignatius, a view which has won general acceptance, yet not without some hesitancy which may not be dispelled until the problem of the sources of the eighth book is solved. Efforts tending to a further identification of the author of this extensive and truly remarkable literature of interpolations have not been successful. That he was a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> may be taken for granted, and a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> not favourably disposed to ascetical practices. That he was not rigidly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>&mdash;;for he uses the language of Subordinationalism&mdash;is also evident; yet he was not an extreme <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>. But whether he was an <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a>, as Dr. Funk would infer from his insistence in denying the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a>, or even a well-meaning Nic&aelig;an whose language reflects the unsettled views held by not a few of his misguided contemporaries, cannot be determined. For, whatever his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> views were, he does not seem to be a partisan or the champion of any <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; nor has he any disciplinary hobby which he would foist on his brethren in the name of Apostolic authority. <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> would appear to be the place of origin of this work, and the interest of the compiler in men and things of Antioch would point to that city as the centre of his activities. His interest in the Ignatian Epistles, his citation of the Syro-Macedonian calendar, his use of the so-called Council of Antioch as one of the chief sources of the "Apostolic Canons", and his construction of a liturgy on Antiochene lines confirm the theory of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> origin. Its date is likewise difficult to determine with accuracy. The earliest <em>terminus a quo</em> would be the Council of Antioch in 341. But the reference to <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> in the catalogue of feasts (V, 13; VIII, 33) seems to postulate a date later than 376, when <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Didascalia, in the enumeration of feasts found in his work against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> makes no mention of the December feast, which in fact was not celebrated in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> until about 378. If the compiler was of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> tendencies he could not have written much later than the death of <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> (378). The absence of reference to either the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> or the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> precludes the possibility of a date later than the early fifth century. The most probable opinion dates the compilation about the year 380, without excluding the possibility of a date two decades earlier or later.
