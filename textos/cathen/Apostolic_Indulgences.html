<h1>Apostolic Indulgences</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> known as Apostolic or Apostolical are those which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, the successor of the Prince of the Apostles, attaches to the crosses, crucifixes, chaplets, <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosaries</a>, images, and <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medals</a> which he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a>, either with his own hand or by those to whom he has delegated this faculty. The principles set forth in the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">general article on indulgences</a> apply here also. But since these Apostolic <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are among the most frequent and abundant of those now in use throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they seem to require a separate and more detailed treatment. As the name implies, they are <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> granted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself. Some of them are plenary, and others are partial <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. It may be observed that, the possession of the cross or <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> or other <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> object is not the sole or immediate condition for gaining the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> attached thereto by the blessing of the Holy Father or his delegate. But the possession enables the recipient to gain the various <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> on the performance of certain prescribed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> or acts of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. In this respect the possession of the object may be regarded as analogous to the local or personal limitation of other <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. For in blessing the objects presented to him, the Holy Father thereby grants the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, not to all the faithful indiscriminately, but to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, to wit the actual or prospective possessors of these crosses, <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medals</a>, etc., which. may thus be regarded as the marks or tokens distinguishing those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom this special privilege is given. At the same time, since it is open to all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to obtain such blessed objects, especially now, when the faculty for giving this blessing is so readily granted to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> throughout the world, the Apostotic <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> can hardly be reckoned with those that are merely local or personal.

<p>Although the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have been in the habit of granting <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> from a much earlier date, some of them having an analogous limitation or connection with the holding or wearing of a blessed object, the Apostolic <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, as we now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, date only from the year 1587-just a lifetime after the publication of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> famous theses against <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. And a curious interest attaches to the first origin of this familiar practice. Before that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had simply blessed <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medals</a> or other objects presented to them for that purpose. But as <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Pope Sixtus V</a> sets forth in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Laudemus viros gloriosos" (1 December, 1587), the workmen engaged in his restoration and adornment of the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>, in pulling down some very old walls, had accidentally brought to light a number of ancient <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> bearing on one side a cross and on the other the likeness of one or other of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors. This remarkable discovery led the pontiff, in accordance with the opening words of his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, to sing the praises of those old rulers of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, such as Constantine, <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>, and Marcianus. And, by a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> thought, he made their old <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> again pass current, though bearing, as be fitted their new life, not an earthly but a heavenly and spiritual value. In other words, he granted a number of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, on the performance of certain <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works, to all who became possessors of the old <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> enriched with this new blessing. The list of special <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> set forth in this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> as thus attached to those <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors is the first instance of the Apostolic <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> now attach to the <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medals</a>, etc. presented for their benediction. It must not be supposed, however, that the Apostolical <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, now so generally given in this familiar manner, are in all respects the same as those granted on this special occasion by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Pope Sixtus V</a>. A comparison of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Laudemus viros gloriosos" with the list in the instruction annexed to the customary faculty for blessing <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosaries</a> etc., attaching <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> thereto, will show many points of difference, both in the extent of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> prescribed as conditions for gaining them. And it will be found, as might have been anticipated, that in some cases the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> given in the Sixtine <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> are more abundant than the others. In at least one important point both lists are in agreement. Thus it will be seen that in both cases a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> may be gained by those who devoutly invoke the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Holy Name of Jesus</a> at the hour of death (<em>in mortis articulo</em>). But, on the other hand, the plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for confession and Communion which the possessors of the Lateran <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> could apparently gain on any day can only be gained by holders of ordinary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> objects on certain great festivals, and that on the fixed condition of reciting certain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.
