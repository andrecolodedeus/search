<h1>Apostolic Majesty</h1>  

<p>A title given to the Kings of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and used, since the time of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, by the King himself, as also in the letters addressed to him by officials or private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. The origin of this title dates from <a href="../cathen/14287a.htm">St. Stephen</a>, who is supposed to have received it from Pope Sylvester II in recognition of the activity displayed by him in promoting the introduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Hartvik, the biographer of St. Stephen, tells us that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> hailed the king as a veritable "Apostle" of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, with reference to his holy labours in spreading the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> through <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The bull, however, of Sylvester II, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 March of the year 1000, whereby the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> grants St. Stephen the crown and title of King, and which returns to him the kingdom he had offered to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and confers on him the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to have the cross carried before him, with an administrative authority over <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and churches, affords no basis for the granting of this particular title. Moreover, the bull, as is clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the latest researches, is a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> of later date than 1574. <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a> having conferred the title of <em>Defensor Fidei</em> on <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII of England</a>, in the year 1521, the nobles of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, with Stephen Werboczi, the learned jurist and later Palatine of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, at their head, opened negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to have the title of "Apostolic Majesty", said to have been granted by Pope Sylvester II to Stephen, conferred on King Louis II. But these negotiations led to no result. In 1627, Ferdinand III endeavoured to obtain the title for himself, but desisted from the attempt when he found the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, Peter P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny, as well as the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> itself, unwilling to accede to his request. When, however, measures were taken, in the reign of Leopold I (1657-1705) to make the royal authority supreme in the domain of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> and administration, the title "Apostolic Majesty" came into use. <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> makes use of the title "Apostolic Queen" for the first time in the letters patent granted to the imperial plenipotentiary sent to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> after the death of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>. In the instructions imparted to this ambassador the hope is expressed that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> will not withhold this title in the future from the ruler of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Pope Clement XIII</a>, on learning of this wish of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, granted this title <em>motu proprio</em> to the queen and her successors, by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Carissima in Christo filia", of 19 August, 1758. The title was thereupon associated with <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> by an edict of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, which prescribed that the title "Apostolic King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>" should be used for the future in all acts, records, and writings. Since then the King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> has borne this title, which, however, only accrues to him after his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>, and does not belong to him before that <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, nor does it extend to the Queen, or to the heir to the throne, the so-called <em>rex junior</em>, who is <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in the life-time of the reigning monarch. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> exercised by the king in respect of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> are not connected with the title "Apostolic Majesty", but are exercised in virtue of the supreme royal right of patronage. (See <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">HUNGARY</a>.)
