<h1>Apostolic Succession</h1>  

<p>Apostolicity as a note of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> being dealt with elsewhere, the object of the present article is to show: <ul> <li>That Apostolic succession is found in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <li>That none of the separate Churches have any valid claim to it. <li>That the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>, in particular, has broken away from Apostolic unity. </ul>
<h2>Roman claim</h2>

<p>The principle underlying the Roman claim is contained in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of succession. "To succeed" is to be the successor of, especially to be the heir of, or to occupy an official position just after, as Victoria succeeded William IV. Now the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiffs</a> come immediately after, occupy the position, and perform the functions of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>; they are, therefore, his successors. We must prove

<ul><li>that <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a> came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and ended there his pontificate; <li>that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishops of Rome</a> who came after him held his official position in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</ul>

<p>As soon as the problem of St. Peter's coming to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> passed from <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> writing <em>pro domo su&acirc;</em> into the hands of unprejudiced historians, i.e. within the last half century, it received a solution which no scholar now dares to contradict; the researches of German professors like A. Harnack and Weizsaecker, of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Bishop Lightfoot, and those of archaeologists like <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> and Lanciani, of Duchesne and Barnes, have all come to the same conclusion: St. Peter did reside and die in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Beginning with the middle of the second century, there exists a universal consensus as to Peter's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; <ul> <li>Dionysius of Corinth speaks for Greece, <li><a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> for Gaul, <li>Clement and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> for Alexandria, <li><a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> for Africa. <li>In the third century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> claim authority from the fact that they are St. Peter's successors, and no one objects to this claim, no one raises a counter-claim. <li>No city boasts the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Apostle but <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. </ul> There he died, there he left his inheritance; the fact is never questioned in the controversies between East and West. This argument, however, has a weak point: it leaves about one hundred years for the formation of historical legends, of which Peter's presence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> may be one just as much as his conflict with <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>. We have then to go farther back into antiquity. <ul> <li>About 150 the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Caius offers to show to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Procius the trophies of the Apostles: "If you will got the Vatican, and to the Via Ostiensis, you will find the monuments of those who have founded this Church." Can Caius and the Romans for whom he speaks have been in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> on a point so vital to their Church? <li>Next we come to Papias (c. 138-150). From him we only get a faint indication that he places Peter's preaching in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, for he states that Mark wrote down what Peter preached, and he makes him write in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Weizsaecker himself holds that this inference from Papias has some weight in the cumulative argument we are constructing. <li>Earlier than Papias is <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius Martyr</a> (before 117), who, on his way to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, writes to the Romans: "I do not command you as did Peter and Paul; they were <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, I am a disciple", words which according to Lightfoot have no sense if Ignatius did not believe Peter and Paul to have been preaching in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <li>Earlier still is <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement of Rome</a> writing to the Corinthians, probably in 96, certainly before the end of the first century. He cites Peter's and Paul's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> as an example of the sad fruits of fanaticism and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. They have suffered "amongst us" he says, and Weizsaecker rightly sees here another <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for our thesis. <li>The Gospel of St. John, written about the same time as the letter Clement to the Corinthians, also contains a clear allusion to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> by crucifixion of St. Peter, without, however, locating it (<a href="../bible/joh021.htm#vrs18">John 21:18, 19</a>). <li>The very oldest evidence comes from St. Peter himself, if he be the author of the First Epistle of Peter, of if not, from a writer nearly of his own time: "The Church that is in Babylon saluteth you, and so doth my son Mark" (<a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#vrs13">1 Peter 5:13</a>). That Babylon stands for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as usual amongst <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and not for the real Babylon, then without <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, is admitted by common consent (cf. F.J.A. Hort, "Judaistic Christianity", London, 1895, 155). </ul> This chain of documentary evidence, having its first link in Scripture itself, and broken nowhere, puts the sojourn of St. Peter in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> among the best-ascertained facts in history. It is further strengthened by a similar chain of monumental evidence, which Lanciani, the prince of Roman topographers, sums up as follows: "For the archaeologist the presence and execution of Sts. Peter and Paul in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> are facts established beyond a shadow of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, by purely monumental evidence!" (<a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagan</a> and Christian <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 123).
<h2>St. Peter's successors in office</h2>

<p>St. Peter's successors carried on his office, the importance of which grew with the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 97 serious dissensions troubled the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. The Roman Bishop, Clement, unbidden, wrote an authoritative letter to restore peace. St. John was still living at Ephesus, yet neither he nor his interfered with Corinth. Before 117 <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a> addresses the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> as the one which "presides over charity . . . which has never deceived any one, which has taught others." St. Iren&aelig;us (180-200) states the theory and practice of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> unity as follows:<blockquote><p>With this Church [of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>] because of its more powerful principality, every Church must agree, that is the faithful everywhere, in this [i.e. in communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>] the tradition of the Apostles has ever been preserved by those on every side. (Adv. Haereses, III) </p></blockquote>



<p>The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> from Phrygia, <a href="../cathen/12344a.htm">Praxeas</a> from <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to gain the countenance of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; St. Victor, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, threatens to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> the Asian Churches; St. Stephen refuses to receive <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> deputation, and separates himself from various Churches of the East; Fortunatus and Felix, deposed by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, have recourse to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, deposed in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, betakes himself to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of Dionysius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, complain of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to Dionysius, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>; the latter expostulates with him, and he explains. The fact is indisputable: the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> took over Peter's Chair and Peter's office of continuing the work of Christ [Duchesne, "The Roman Church before Constantine", <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Univ. Bulletin (October, 1904) X, 429-450]. To be in continuity with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded by Christ affiliation to the See of Peter is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for, as a matter of history, there is no other Church linked to any other Apostle by an unbroken chain of successors. Antioch, once the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and centre of St. Peter's labours, fell into the hands of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> under the Emperors Zeno and Anastasius at the end of the fifth century. The <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was founded by St. Mark the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>, the mandatory of St. Peter. It flourished exceedingly until the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> took root among its people and gradually led to its extinction. The shortest-lived Apostolic Church is that of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. In 130 the Holy City was destroyed by Hadrian, and a new town, &AElig;lia Capitolina, erected on its site. The new Church of &AElig;lia Capitolina was subjected to Caesarea; the very name of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> fell out of use till after the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nice</a> (325). The Greek Schism now claims its allegiance. Whatever of Apostolicity remains in these Churches founded by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> is owing to the fact that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> picked up the broken succession and linked anew to the See of Peter. The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, embracing all the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> involved in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Photius and <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael Caerularius</a>, and the Russian Church can lay no claim to Apostolic succession either direct or indirect, i.e. through <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, because they are, by their own fact and will, separated from the Roman Communion. During the four hundred and sixty-four between the accession of Constantine (323) and the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Seventh General Council</a> (787), the whole or part of the Eastern episcopate lived in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> for no less than two hundred and three years: namely from the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (343) to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (389), 55 years; owing to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> condemnation (404-415), 11 years; owing to Acadius and the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm"><em>Henoticon</em> edict</a> (484-519), 35 years; total, 203 years (Duchesne). They do, however, claim <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> connection with the Apostles, sufficient to their mind to stamp them with the mark of Apostolicity.
<h2>The Anglican continuity claim</h2>

<p>The continuity claim is brought forward by all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, a fact showing how essential a note of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church Apostolicity is. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> High-Church party asserts its continuity with the pre-Reformation Church in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and through it with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. "At the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> we but washed our face" is a favourite <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> saying; we have to show that in reality they washed off their head, and have been a truncated Church ever since. Etymologically, "to continue" means "to hold together". Continuity, therefore, denotes a successive existence without constitutional change, an advance in time of a thing in itself steady. Steady, not stationary, for the nature of a thing may be to grow, to develop on constitutional lines, thus constantly changing yet always the selfsame. This applies to all organisms starting from a germ, to all organizations starting from a few constitutional principles; it also applies to religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, which as <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> says, changes in order to remain the same. On the other hand, we speak of a "breach of continuity" whenever a constitutional change takes place. A Church enjoys continuity when it develops along the lines of its original constitution; it changes when it alters its constitution either social or <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a>. But what is the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Christ? The answer is as varied as the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> calling themselves <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Being persuaded that continuity with Christ is essential to their legitimate status, they have devised theories of the essentials of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and of a <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, exactly suiting their own denomination. Most of the repudiatae Apostolic succession as a mark of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church; they glory in their separation. Our present controversy is not with such, but with the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> who do pretend to continuity. We have points of contact only with the High-Churchmen, whose leanings toward antiquity and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> place them midway between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> pure and simple.
<h2>England and Rome</h2>

<p>Of all the Churches now separated from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, none has a more distinctly Roman origin than the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>. It has often been claimed that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, or some other Apostle, evangelized the Britons. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, that whenever <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> annals mention the introduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into the island, invariably they conduct the reader to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 136) we read that "Pope Eleutherius received a letter from Lucius, King of Britain, that he might be made a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> by his orders." The incident is told again and again by the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>; it is found in the Book of <a href="../cathen/09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, as well as in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; it is accepted by French, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>, German chroniclers, together with the home authorities Fabius, <a href="../cathen/07235d.htm">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06568d.htm">Giraldus Cambrensis</a>.

<p>The Saxon invasion swept the British Church out of existence wherever it penetrated, and drove the British <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to the western borders of the island, or across the sea into Armorica, now French Brittany. No attempt at converting their conquerors was ever made by the conquered. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> once more stepped in. The missionaries sent by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> converted and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> King Ethelbert of Kent, with thousands of his subjects. In 597 <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">Augustine</a> was made Primate over all <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and his successors, down to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, have ever received from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, the symbol of super-episcopal authority. The Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was thoroughly Roman in its origin, in its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and practice, in its obedience and affection; witness every page in <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede's</a> "Ecclesiastical History". A like Roman spirit animated the nation. Among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> recognized by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are twenty-three kings and sixty queens, princes, or princesses of the different Anglo-Saxon dynasties, reckoned from the seventh to the eleventh century. Ten of the Saxon kings made the journey to the <a href="../cathen/13374a.htm">tomb of St. Peter</a>, and his successor, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> formed quite a colony in proximity to the Vatican, where the local topography (<em>Borgo, Sassia, Vicus Saxonum</em>) still recalls their memory. There was an English <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, founded by King Ine of Wessex and <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Pope Gregory II</a> (715-731), and supported by the <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Romescot</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's-pence</a>, paid yearly by every Wessex <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Romescot</a> was made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> by <a href="../cathen/05322a.htm">Edward the Confessor</a>, on every <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and household in possession of land or cattle to the yearly value of thirty pence.

<p>The Norman Conquest (1066) wrought no change in the religion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a> (1093-1109) testified to the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> in his writings (in <a href="../bible/mat016.htm">Matthew 16</a>) and by his acts. When pressed to surrender his right of appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he answered the king in court:

<blockquote><p>You wish me to swear never, on any account, to appeal in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to Blessed Peter or his Vicar; this, I say, ought not to be commanded by you, who are a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, for to swear this is to <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> Blessed Peter; he who <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjures</a> Blessed Peter undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjures</a> Christ, who made him Prince over his Church. </p></blockquote>

<p><a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas Becket</a> shed his blood in defence of the liberties of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the encroachments of the Norman king (1170). <a href="../cathen/07037a.htm">Grosseteste</a>, in the thirteenth century, writes more forcibly on the Pope's authority over the whole Church than any other ancient <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, although he resisted an ill-advised appointment to a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> made by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. In the fourteen century <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> teaches at Oxford "that they are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who teach or hold anything different from what the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> holds or teaches." In 1411 the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> condemn <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wycliffe's</a> proposition "that it is not of necessity to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to hold that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> is supreme among the Churches." In 1535 <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Blessed John Fisher</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester, is <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for upholding against <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> the Pope's supremacy over the English Church. The most striking piece of evidence is the working of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> taken by <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> before entering into office: "I, Robert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, from this hour forward, will be faithful and obedient to St. Peter, to the Holy Apostolic <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, to my Lord Pope Celestine, and his successors canonically succeeding...I will, saving my order, give aid to defend and to maintain against every man the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and the royalty of St. Peter. I will visit the threshold of the Apostles every three years, either in person or by my deputy, unless I be absolved by apostolic <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>...So help me <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and these holy Gospels." (Wilkins, Concilia Angliae, II, 199).

<p><a href="../cathen/02726c.htm">Chief Justice Bracton</a> (1260) lays down the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> of this country thus: "It is to be noted concerning the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of superior and inferior courts, that in the first place as the Lord Pope has ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all in spirituals, so the king has, in the realm, in temporals." The line of demarcation between things spiritual and temporal is in many cases blurred and uncertain; the two powers often overlap, and conflicts are unavoidable. During five hundred years such conflicts were frequent. Their very recurrence, however, proves that <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy, for it requires two to make a quarrel. The complaint of one side was always that the other encroached upon its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> himself, in 1533, still pleaded in the Roman Courts for a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>. Had he succeeded, the supremacy of the Pope would not have found a more strenuous defender. It was only after his failure that he questioned the authority of the tribunal to which he had himself appealed. In 1534 he was, by Act of Parliament, made the Supreme Head of the English Church. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, instead of swearing allegiance to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, now <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> allegiance to the King, without any saving clause. <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Blessed John Fisher</a> was the only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who refused to take the new <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is the first witness to the breach of continuity between the old English and the new <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Church. Heresy stepped in to widen the breach.

<p>The Thirty-nine Articles teach the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, deny <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, reduce the seven <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to two, insist on the fallibility of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, establish the king's supremacy, and deny the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Mass was abolished, and the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>; the form of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> was so altered to suit the new views on the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> that it became ineffective, and the succession of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> failed as well as the succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">ANGLICAN ORDERS</a>.) Is it possible to imagine that the framers of such vital alternations thought of "continuing" the existing Church? When the hierarchical framework is destroyed, when the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> foundation is removed, when every stone of the edifice is freely rearranged to suit individual tastes, then there is no continuity, but collapse. The old <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of Battle Abbey still stands, also parts of the outer wall, and one faces a stately, newish, comfortable mansion; green lawns and shrubs hide old foundations of church and <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks'</a> scriptorium and storerooms still stand to sadden the visitor's mood. Of the abbey of 1538, the abbey of 1906 only keeps the mask, the diminished <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> and the stones--a fitting image of the old Church and the new.
<h2>Present stage</h2>

<p>Dr. James Gairdner, whose "History of the English Church in the 16th Century" lays bare the essentially <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> spirit of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, in a letter on "Continuity" (reproduced in the Tablet, 20 January, 1906), shifts the controversy from historical to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> ground. "If the country," he says, "still contained a community of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>--that is to say, of real believers in the great gospel of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, men who still accepted the old creeds, and had no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died to save them--then the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> remained the same as before. The old system was preserved, in fact all that was really essential to it, and as regards <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> nothing was taken away except some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> scholastic propositions."
