<h1>Apostolic Syndic</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, who in the name, and by the authority, of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> assumes the care and civil administration of the temporalities and in particular the pecuniary <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> destined for the support and benefit of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and thence provides for the requirements of the brethren. To the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> corporate as well as individual ownership was forbidden by the constitution or the rule. During the first years of the order's existence, the literal observance of this precept, being feasible as well as possible, presented no difficulty; but as time went on, and the order developed as a vast organization, and spread over the whole world, countless difficulties had to be faced and fierce controversy arose, the <em>quaestio de paupertate</em> lasting for centuries. To preserve and safeguard as far as possible the letter as well as the spirit of the complete "expropriation" advocated by St. Francis, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> adopted the <em>fictio juris</em> of assuming to themselves the ownership of all goods bestowed upon the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were legally regarded as mere users, the right of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> being vested in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, except in cases where the donors made explicit reservation in their own behalf. But as the civil administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in one's own interest is an act of ownership, and this was prohibited by the rule, such administration had to be exercised by a steward appointed, or at least authorized, by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> of Nicolas III, "Exiit qui seminat" (art. 12, n. 2), 14 August, 1279, the appointment of the syndic Apostolic rested with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> or the cardinal protector,&mdash;sometimes <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> acted as their delegates in this matter; but <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> ("Exultantes", 18 January, 1283) empowered the superiors of the order&mdash;the general, the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a>, and the custodes&mdash;within their respective spheres of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, to appoint and remove syndics as circumstances might require. The larger powers with which the syndic was invested by <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> and by his successors, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> ("Constitutiones Martinianae" in <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a>, "Annales", X, 301) and <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> ("Ex Clementi", 1 July, 1555), gave rise to the appellation <em>syndicus Martinianus</em> in contradistinction to <em>syndicus communis</em>. This latter, as constituted by <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> (Exiit) and <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> ("Exivi de Paradiso", 6 May, 1312), could deal only with movable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> (valuables excepted) and with purchase moneys. The Martinian syndic on the other hand, as trustee and agent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, might receive and dispose of all goods movable and immovable (money offerings, legacies, and remunerations) and, in pursuance of his trust, institute proceedings in the courts and take such other steps as might be deemed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to protect the interest of the community in whose favour he acted. The Apostolic syndic and his wife and children were accorded the enjoyment of all and sundry <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, pardons, and privileges which the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> themselves have obtained, or shall obtain, from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (<a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, "Dum Consideramus", 16 April, 1526).
