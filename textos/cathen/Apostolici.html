<h1>Apostolici</h1>  

<p>The name of four different <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> bodies.
<h2 id="section1">Heretics of the third century</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, which sprang up in the second century in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, with principles borrowed from <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> or <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, practised an excessive asceticism which exaggerated <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> and distorted the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. By the third century they had split into groups of Apostolici, <a href="../cathen/01650a.htm">Apotactici</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01660d.htm">Hydroparastates or Aquarians</a>, names taken from their customs or tenets. The Apostolici so styled themselves because they claimed to lead the life of the Apostles and to be derived from them. Hence they proscribed marriage and property-holding as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, admitting into their body no married men or <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> owners. They lapsed into <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatianism</a>, and finally became <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>. Their names and leaders are not known.
<h2 id="section2">Heretics of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Apostolics, or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Apostles, was started in 1260, at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, by an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> man of low extraction named Gerard Segarelli (also written Segalelli, Sagarelli, Cicarelli), who strove to reproduce the life of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. He adopted a white cloak and grey robe, let his <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a> and hair grow, and wore the sandals and cord of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. He sold his house, gave away the price he received, and traversed the streets preaching penance and Apostolic poverty. He had followers to such an extent that in 1287 the Council of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> forbade them to continue their mode of life and prohibited the faithful from aiding them. Segarelli remained at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, was in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for awhile, and then in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace, where he was regarded as an object of amusement. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> increased, and <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a> (11 March, 1286) and <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> (1290) condemned it. Segarelli was again <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in 1294, escaped, was retaken, <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, but relapsed, and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authorities</a> burned him at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, 18 July, 1300. Dulcin, a bold, mediocre, and unscrupulous man, assumed control of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> Apostles, issued manifestos, and finally collecting his partisans withdrew with them to the mountains of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> and <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, until 1306, when <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> organized a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against him. He was captured, his body broken and delivered to the flames, and his disciples crushed. Some of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> appeared, however, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1315; <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> took measures against them in 1318, and they are mentioned by the Council of Narbonne, 1374. Their characteristic from the start was a declaration of a return to the life, and especially the poverty, of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> charged them with violating a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Second &OElig;cumenical Council of Lyons in founding a new <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant</a> order and with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching. Dulcin's tenets were: the imitation of Apostolic life; poverty was to be absolute, obedience, interior; and one engaged himself, though by no <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, to live by <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Dulcin also taught that the course of humanity is marked by four periods: <ol><li>that of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; <li>that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and the Apostles; <li>that beginning with Popes Sylvester and Constantine, in which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> declined through <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of riches; <li>the era of Segarelli and Dulcin, to the end of the world.</ol>

<p>He uttered several <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> prophecies and professed liberty of thought. Free <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> have been imputed to this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/13400a.htm">Salimbene</a> (Chronica, 117) and Bernard Gui (Practica inquisitionis <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>&aelig; pravitatis, 339), but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> bulls are silent on this head.
<h2 id="section3">The new <em>apostolici</em> of the twelfth century</h2>

<p>The new apostolici of the twelfth century, chiefly in the vicinity of Cologne, and at <a href="../cathen/11668a.htm">P&eacute;rigueux</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, permitted no marriage, forbade the use of flesh meat, because it and similar products were the result of sexual intercourse; they explained that sinners (i.e. all who did not belong to their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, in which alone was to be found the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>) could neither receive nor administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. In consequence they set aside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and gave each member of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> the power to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> at his daily mealtime and so to receive the Body and Blood of Christ. They rejected infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, veneration of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a>, <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, and disdained the use of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, because all this was not found in the teaching of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Their external conduct was blameless, but notwithstanding their reputation for chastity, their community life with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was a clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their deceptive and dangerous character. Meanwhile the people had come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their character and the public aversion and disgust constantly increased, particularly in the vicinity of Cologne, where two members after being given three days for consideration were burned alive. <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> in his sermon calls on <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> to take regular procedure against them.
<h2 id="section4">Apostolici</h2>

<p>A branch of the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>, which practised <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, interpreted <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> literally, and declared the <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washing of feet</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, from which they were called also Pedonites.
