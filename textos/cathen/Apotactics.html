<h1>Apotactics</h1>  

<p>(From Greek, <em>apotassomai</em>, to renounce).

<p>The adherents of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which sprang up in the third century and spread through the western and southern parts of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. What little we know of this obscure <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> we owe to the writings of <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>. He tells us that they called themselves Apotactics (i.e. renunciators) because they scrupulously renounced all private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; they also affected the name of Apostolics, because they pretended to follow the manner of life of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The saint regards them as a branch of the Tatians, akin to the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a>. "Their <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and mysteries are different from ours; they <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves upon extreme poverty, bring divisions into <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Church</a> by their foolish <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>, and depart from the divine mercy by refusing to admit to reconciliation those who have once fallen, and like those from whom they have sprung, condemn marriage. In place of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which they reject, they base their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> on the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts of Andrew and Thomas. They are altogether alien from the rule of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". At the time when <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> wrote, in the fourth century, they had become an insignificant <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, for in refuting them he says: "They are found in small groups in Phrygia, Cilicia, and Pamphylia, whereas the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise, has spread to the ends of the earth, and if marriage is an unholy thing, then they are doomed to speedy extinction, or else they must be born out of wedlock. If they are born out of wedlock, then they themselves are impure. And if they are not impure, although born in wedlock, then marriage is not impure.... The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> praises renouncement, but does not condemn marriage; she preaches poverty, but does not intolerantly inveigh against those who possess <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> inherited from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> with which they support themselves and assist the poor; many in the church abstain from certain kinds of food, but do not look with contempt upon those who do not so abstain." <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> mentions these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in his Epistles. He gives them the name of <em>Apotaktitai</em> (Apotactites) and says that they declared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures defiled (<em>inquinatam</em>). They are also briefly mentioned by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>. They were condemned in the Code of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius the Great</a> as a branch of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manicheans</a>.
