<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Appeal as from an abuse</h1>  

<p>(<em>Appel comme d'abus</em>)

<p>Appeal was originally a recourse to the civil forum against the usurpation by the <a href="../cathen/06153b.htm">ecclesiastical forum</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a>; and likewise a recourse to the <a href="../cathen/06153b.htm">ecclesiastical forum</a> against the usurpation by the civil forum of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>.

<p>Thus defined, the "appeal as from an abuse" was in itself legitimate, because its object was to safeguard equally the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> both of the State and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. An abuse would be an act on either hand, without due authority, beyond the limits of their respective ordinary and natural jurisdictions. The canons (can. "Dilecto", in bk. VI of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, "De sent. excom.", in ch. vi) did not exclude a recourse to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> when the acts of an <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judge</a> invaded the domain of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, especially as reciprocity gave the ecclesiastical authority the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to repel with the same weapons any usurpation by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a> judge to the damage of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Thus also a recourse to the supreme civil ruler was not deemed amiss when an <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> undertook a cause belonging to the competency of a higher <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a>, and the ruler was asked (can. "Placuit" in Decree of Gratian, Pt. II, Q. I, ch. xi) merely to forward it to the proper tribunal without, however, claiming to delegate to it any jurisdiction.

<p>Perhaps the first formal manifestation of this appeal in the legitimate sense occurred in the fourteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judges</a> had acquired a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for greater learning and equity, and by the good will of the State, not merely ecclesiastical, but many civil cases of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were adjudicated by them. In 1329 complaint was brought to King Philip de Valois by the advocate general, Peter de Cugni&egrave;res, that the civil tribunals were fast lapsing into contempt, and were being abandoned. The purport of the complaint was to restrict the competency of the ecclesiastical tribunals to their own legitimate fields. Bickerings between the two forums were henceforth frequent.

<p>Even the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states, after the beginning of the sixteenth century, advanced far in the way of frequent ruptures with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> states in the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">new revolution</a> had acquired control and supervision over the newly reformed bodies even in their spiritual relations, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states, particularly <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, strove to limit the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as far as they could without casting aside the profession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> was a serious aggression by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> upon the acknowledged <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>It is in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> that we find the most flagrant series of encroachments upon <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, through pretence of appeals as from an abuse, gradually tending to the elimination of the <a href="../cathen/06153b.htm">ecclesiastical forum</a>. During the seventeenth century the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> presented frequent memorials against the encroachments made by their kings and parliaments through constant recourse to these "appeals as from an abuse", which resulted in submitting to civil tribunals questions of definitions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the proper administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and the like. This brought confusion into the regulation of spiritual matters by encouraging <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to rebel against their lawful <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical superiors</a>. The lay tribunals undertook to adjudicate as to whether the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> had a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to refuse them to those deemed unworthy, or the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> dying impenitent or under <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">Church censures</a>; whether <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicts</a> or <a href="../cathen/14345b.htm">suspensions</a> were valid; whether <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">monastic professions</a> should be annulled; whether the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> permission was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for preaching; whether a specified marriage was contrary or not to the Gospel; and also to decide the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">canonical privations of benefices</a>. Many other subjects intimately connected with the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were brought before lay tribunals, and unappealable decisions rendered in open contradiction to the canons, as can easily be surmised both from the absence of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and from the visible animus shown in decisions that undertook to subject the spiritual power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the dictates of transient politics. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> government should respect the <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">ecclesiastical canons</a>.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> interference was mostly owing to courtier-canonists who flattered the secular rulers by dwelling upon the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of protection over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> willingly conceded in early days to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Roman Emperors. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the latter were occasionally called guardians of the canons, and that they often embodied these canons with the civil legislation of the Empire (see <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">CONSTANTINOPLE</a>, JUSTINIAN, <a href="../cathen/11094a.htm">NOMOCANON</a>). This did not mean, however, that the Emperors were the source of the binding power of the canons, which was recognized as inherent in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a> to the power of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to bind and loose, but that the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> empire was to aid in the enforcement of the ecclesiastical laws by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was recognized as autonomous in all things of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a> and in matters of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>.

<p>We find the &oelig;cumenical councils appealing to the emperors to put into force their <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, though no one should infer from this that the emperors were recognized as judges of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. So, likewise, when <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a> inserts ecclesiastical disciplinary <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> in the civil code he explains (Novella, xlii): "we have thus <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decreed</a>, following the canons of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers." When rulers like <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> seemed to take upon themselves undue authority, insisting upon certain canons, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> claimed their sole <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to govern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Even in mixed assemblies of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and nobles and princes, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> insisted that the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> should not encroach upon the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, e.g. in the Council of Narbonne (788). <a href="../cathen/15740b.htm">Zaccaria</a> (Dissertaz. 28) did not hesitate to recognize, however, that in his day (the eighteenth century), as well as in former ages, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rulers of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> States, in their quality of protectors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, might receive a recourse from <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in ecclesiastical matters, in order that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> might be done them by their ordinary <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judges</a>, not as deputies of the civil rulers, but as ordinary judges in their own forum.

<p>In her <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in view of the changed circumstances of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, has granted to several that the civil cases of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and such as concern the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and temporal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of churches, as well as <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and other <a href="../cathen/06157b.htm">ecclesiastical foundations</a>, may be brought before the civil courts. Nevertheless, all ecclesiastical causes and those which concern the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, sacred functions, and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> connected with the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">sacred ministry</a>, belong to the <a href="../cathen/06153b.htm">ecclesiastical forum</a>, both in regard of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and of matter (cf. <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">Concordat</a> with <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> in 1881).

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, as <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decreed</a> by the Council of Baltimore (1837), the church law is that if any <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical person</a> or member of a religious body, male or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>, should cite an <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastic</a> or a religious before a civil court on a question of a purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> nature, he should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he falls under the <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">censures</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decreed</a> by canon law. The <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> in its comment explained that, in mixed cases, where the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may be ecclesiastical, but the things about which there is question may be temporal or of one's household, this rule cannot be enforced, especially in countries in which the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil government</a> is not in the hands of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and where, unless recourse is had to the civil courts, there is not the means or the power of enforcing an <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">ecclesiastical decision</a> for the protection or recovery of one's own. A special proviso was made by <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (17 August, 1886), that if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should bring a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> before a civil tribunal on an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or other question without permission from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he could be forced to withdraw the case by the infliction of penalties and censures, yet the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must not refuse the permission if the parties have ineffectually attempted a settlement before him. If the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to be cited, the permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is required.

By a special declaration of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (6 September, 1886), a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric's</a> transfer of a claim to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> for the purpose of evading the censures is checked by the requirement of the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to such transfer, if made for the purpose of the suit. <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">Justice</a> Redfield (in vol. XV, Am. Law Reg., p. 277, quoted with approval in vol. XCVIII of Penn. Rep., p. 213) says in reference to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> generally: "The decision of <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a> or officers having, by the rules or <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the bodies to which they belong, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of such questions, or the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to decide them, will be held conclusive in all courts of the civil administration, and no question involved in such decisions will be revised or reviewed in the civil courts, except those pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of such courts or officers to determine such questions according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or the usage of the bodies they represent." Justice Strong, of the Supreme Court of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, in his lecture on the "Relations of Civil Law to Church Policy" (p. 41), speaks of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as "an interior organization within a religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>", and adds (p. 42), "I think it may be safely asserted as a general principle that whenever questions of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of Church rule, of membership, or of office, have been decided by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in its own modes of decision, <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> tribunals accept these decisions as final and apply them as made."
