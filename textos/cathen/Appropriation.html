<h1>Appropriation</h1>  

<p>In general, consists in the attribution to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or thing of a character or quality which determines in a special way this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or thing. In <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, appropriation is used in speaking of the different Persons of the Trinity. It consists in attributing certain names, qualities, or operations to one of the Persons, not, however, to the exclusion of the others, but in preference to the others. The qualities and names thus appropriated belong essentially to all the Persons; yet, according to our understanding of the data of revelation and our <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> concepts, we consider some of these characteristics or names as belonging to one Person rather than to another, or as determining more clearly this particular Person. Thus we consider the Father as particularly characterized by <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, the Son by wisdom, and the Holy Ghost by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, though we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the three have essentially and by nature an equal <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, Summa Theologica, I, Q. xxxix, a. 7; <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, De Deo Trino, Rome, 1881, Th. xiii, 216). Appropriation is not merely arbitrary; it is based on our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Trinity, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has its sources and rules in Revelation (Scripture and tradition) and in the analogies which our reason discovers between created things and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and the Persons of the Trinity as those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are represented in Revelation. Of necessity, we understand the data of Revelation only under human concepts, that is, in an analogical way (see A<font size=-2>NALOGY</font>. It is, therefore, by their analogy with creatures and created relations that we conceive the different Persons of the Trinity and their relations. Each Person of the Trinity is presented to us with a proper characteristic which is the constitutive element of the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. Remarking, as we do naturally, that among creatures certain attributes, qualities, or operations are the properties of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> possessing such a characteristic, we conceive the Trinity after this remote suggestion, though in an analogical and supereminent way, and we appropriate to each Person of the Trinity the names, qualities, or operations which, in creatures, are the consequences or properties of this characteristic. Appropriation, therefore, has its source in revelation, and it has its foundation and rule in the very characteristic which constitutes each distinct <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> in the Trinity and the relations existing between the essential properties of the Divine Nature and this constitutive characteristic of each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>&mdash;these relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being known by analogy with the relations existing between these same properties and this same characteristic in creatures (St. Thomas, loc. cit.; <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, loc. cit.). Among the names used in speaking of the Persons of the Trinity, the name <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is often appropriated to the Father, the name Lord to the Son, the name Spirit, in the sense of immaterial substance, to the Third Person. Among the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is appropriated to the Father, as source and first principle of all things; beauty to the Son, Who, proceeding by way of intelligence, is the perfect image of the Father; fruition to the Holy Ghost, Who proceeds through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Again, unity is appropriated to the Father, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to the Son, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> to the Holy Ghost. Among the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a> of action and operation, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> is appropriated to the Father, with all the operations which it implies, especially creation; wisdom and its works, especially the order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, to the Son; and to the Holy Ghost, charity and its works, especially sanctification (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion, n. 2, 3, etc., 17, 47). Again, efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> with the production of all things is appropriated to the Father; exemplary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> with the organization of all things, to the Son; final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> with the conservation and perfecting of all things, to the Holy Ghost [cf. St. Thomas, "Summa Theol.", I, Q, xxxiv, a. 8; H. Dubois, "De Exemplarismo Divino," XII, &#167;4 (Rome, 1897)]. Appropriation as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> method or theory is of comparatively recent origin. But from the beginning of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, it was used as a spontaneous expression of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> conception of the Trinity. It has its source, as already said, in Scripture and in tradition. In Scripture it is used notably by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs3">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="../bible/eph004.htm">4:4-6</a>; <a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs9">Romans 15:9</a>; <a href="../bible/2co001.htm#vrs3">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="../bible/2co011.htm#vrs31">11:31</a>; cf. also, <a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#vrs3">1 Peter 1:3</a>). In tradition it is expressed especially in the formulas of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">Symbols</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion", n. 2-13, 17, 47); in liturgy, and especially in doxologies (cf. Dom Cabrol, "Le livre de la pri&#232;re antique", xix, Poitiers, 1900); in inscriptions and pictures (Franzelin, op. cit.; H. Marucchi, "El&eacute;ments d'arch&eacute;ologie chr&eacute;tienne", Rome, 1900). As early as the third century with <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, later with <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>, and others, the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> speak of the <em>kl&eacute;sein,</em> or divine appellations, though it cannot be said yet that they furnish a theory of appropriation (De R&eacute;gnon: Etudes de th&eacute;ologie positive sur la S. Trinit&eacute;, &eacute;tudes xvii, xxv, Paris, 1898). This theory is established by the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> of the fourth and fifth centuries, especially by St. Hilary, "De Trinitate", II, n. 1; P.L., t. X, col. 50; <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, "De Trinitate", VI, x, P.L., t. XLII, col. 931; <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a>, "Sermode Pentecoste", LXXVI, iii, P.L., t. LIV, col. 405. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, the theory was accepted, completed, and systematically taught by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>: In I Sent. dist., xxxiv, q. iii; Opera, Quaracchi, 1883, t. 1b, 592; St. Thomas, Sum. Theol., 1a pars., Q. xxxix, a. 8). <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, who considered the appropriated qualities as belonging exclusively to the Person made the subject of appropriation, was condemned in the Council of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> (1141) and by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>.
