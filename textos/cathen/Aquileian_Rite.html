<h1>Aquileian Rite</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">See of Aquileia</a> fell into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> during the quarrel of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> (under Bishop Macedonius, 539-56) and became a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, which lasted till the year 700. A number of allusions tell us that <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> and certain of its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> had a special rite (generally called the "ritus patriarchinus"); but they do not give us any clear indication as to what this rite was. The earliest and most instructive document of the Patriarchine Rite is a capitulare of the eighth century added by a Lombard hand to the "Codex Richdigeranus" (sixth century). Dom G. Morin (Revue benedictine, 1902, p. 2 sq.) and H. F. Haase, who edited the Codex (Breslau, 1865), show reason to suppose that this capitulare represents the use of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. Supposing this, it gives us valuable information about the Aquileian Calendar for the time it covers (<a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> to June). <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> had five <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>; St. Stephen's Day is 27 Dec., as in the Rites of Jerusalem-Antioch and their descendants. There is no <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a>; two <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> (<a href="../cathen/13747a.htm">Sexagesima</a> and <a href="../cathen/12614a.htm">Quinquagesima</a>) prepare for <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>. The "tradition of the symbol" is on the Sunday before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. It and <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> have each two Masses, as in the Gallican Rites. There is a "Mid- Pentecost" feast, as in many <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a>. We have then many indications of the divergence from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; this fragment of a calendar points to Gallican usages mixed with some from the East. If we accept the most probable theory that the <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a> is Eastern (Antiochene) in origin, we may consider the local Aquileian Use as one more variant of the wide-spread Gallican <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. For the rest we are reduced to mere conjecture about this liturgy. There are many theories, especially as to its relation to the rites of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and the fragments in "De sacramentis", IV, 4-6. Dr. Buchwald defends the view that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in "De Sacr." are Aquileian. Aquileia adopted them from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, under whose influence she stood (so a synod of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> declared in 381; op. cit., 47). <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> then took her Canon from <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> about the fifth century (Weidenauer, Studien, I, 1906, pp. 21-56). If this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the influence of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> on the Western liturgy has been enormous. Aquileia would be the gate by which our <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Roman Canon</a> came to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Baumstark ascribes "De sacr." to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. But he agrees that it came from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and that <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> used the same rite. The "ritus patriarchinus" then would be the same as the Rite of the Exarchate, which he defends ("Liturgia romana e liturgia dell'esarcato", Rome, 1904, pp. 168-73). We may accept as certain that <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> had from the time of the formation of separate rites (fourth century) its own use, that this use was not the same as that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that probably it was one more variant of the large group of Western Rites, connected by (Eastern?) origin, which we call Gallican, that it was probably really related to the <a href="../cathen/01394a.htm">old Milanese Rite</a> and perhaps still more to that of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>.

<p>In the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> we hear of the "ritus patriarchinus" as yielding steadily to the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. Ebner has published a very curious and important variant of our "Hanc igitur" <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> form, attributed to <a href="../cathen/11586a.htm">Paulinus of Aquileia</a> (about 850). For the importance of this see the author's work, "The Mass" (London, 1912, pp. 149-150). De Rubeis in his "De sacris foroiuliensium ritibus" (Venice, 1754, pp. 228 sqq.) prints part of the Aquileian scrutiny of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, of the ninth century. This is practically that of the contemporary Roman Ordines; so the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> was already replacing the other one (cf. Dom de Puniet, "L'ann&eacute;e liturgique &agrave; Aquil&eacute;e" in "Revue b&eacute;n&eacute;d.", 1902, p. 1). Walafrid Strabo (ninth century) mentions "hymns" composed by <a href="../cathen/11586a.htm">Paulinus of Aquileia</a> and used by him "in private Masses at the offering of the sacrifice" (de eccl. rerum ex. et increm. 25). In 1250 Peter IV, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03793c.htm">Castello</a> in the Aquileian province, desired to adopt the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. In 1308 and again in 1418 an attempt was made to restore the Aquileian Use at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. But in 1456 <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> granted permission to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Grado and Aquileia to follow <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V's</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missal</a> (1570) one after another of the cities which had kept the Aquileian Use conformed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: Trieste in 1586, <a href="../cathen/15118a.htm">Udine</a> in 1596. Como alone made an effort to keep the old local use. In 1565 and 1579 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> still insisted on this. But in 1597 <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> insisted on Roman Use here too. Only the Church of St. Mark at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> kept certain local peculiarities of ritual, which apparently descended from the "ritus patriarchinus", till the fall of the republic in 1807. But long before its final disappearance the Aquileian Rite in these local forms was already so romanized that little of its original character was left. Francis Bonomio, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, who went to Como in 1579 to persuade its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to adopt the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, says that the local rite was almost the same as that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> "except in the order of some <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, and the feast of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, which is transferred to another time". So the "Missale pro s. aquileyensis ecclesiae ritu", printed at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in 1494, breviaries and <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">sacramentaries</a> (rituals) printed for Aquileia, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and Como in the fourteenth century, although still bearing the name of the "ritus patriarchinus" (or "patriarchalis"), are hardly more than local varieties of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> (for all this, see Le Brun, op. cit., and Baumstark, "Liturgia romana", pp. 170-73).
