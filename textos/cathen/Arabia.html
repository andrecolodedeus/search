<h1>Arabia</h1>  

<p>Arabia is the cradle of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> and, in all probability, the primitive home of the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> race. It is a peninsula of an irregularly triangular form, or rather, an irregular parallelogram, bounded on the north by <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and the Syrian <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>; on the south by the Indian Ocean, on the east by the Persian Gulf and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, and on the west by the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>. The length of its western coast line along the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, is about 1,800 miles, while its breadth, from the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> to the Persian Gulf, is about 600 miles. Hence its size is about one million square miles and, accordingly, it is about four times as large as the <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">State of Texas</a>, or over one-fourth of the size of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and as large as <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> all combined.

<p>The general aspect of Arabia is that of a central table-land surrounded by a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> belt, sandy to the west, south, and east and stony to the north. Its outlying circle is girt by a line of mountains low and sterile, although, towards Yemen and Oman, on the lower south-west and lower south-east, these mountains attain a considerable height, breadth, and fertility. The surface of the midmost table-land is sandy, and thus about one-fifth of Arabia is cultivated, or rather two-thirds cultivable, and one-third irreclaimable <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. According to Doughty, the geological aspect of Arabia is simple, consisting of a foundation stock of plutonic rock whereon lie sandstone and, above that, limestone. Arabia has no rivers, and its mountain streams and fresh-water springs, which in certain sections are quite numerous, are utterly inadequate, considering the immense geographical area the peninsula covers. Wadys, or valleys, are very numerous and generally dry for nine or ten months in the year. Rains are infrequent, and consequently the vegetation, except in certain portions of Yemen, is extremely sparse.

<p>The most commonly accepted division of Arabia into Deserta (desert), Felix (happy), and Petraea (stony), due to Greek and Roman writers, is altogether arbitrary. Arabic geographers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of this division, for they divide it generally into five provinces: The first is Yemen, embracing the whole south of the peninsula and including Hadramaut, Mahra, Oman, Shehr, and Nejran. The second is Hijaz, on the west coast and including Mecca and Medina, the two famous centres of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. The third is Tehama, along the same coast between Yemen and Hijaz. The fourth is Nejd, which includes most of the central table-land, and the fifth is Yamama, extending all the wide way between Yemen and Nejd. This division is also inadequate, for it omits the greater part of North and East Arabia. A third and modern division of Arabia, according to politico-geographical principles, is into seven provinces: Hijaz, Yemen, Hadramaut, Oman, Hasa, Irak, and Nejd. At present, with the exception of the Sinaitic peninsula and about 200 miles of the coast south of the Gulf of Akaba which is under Anglo-Egyptian rule, Hijaz, Yemen, Hasa and Irak are <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> provinces, the other three being ruled by independent Arab rulers, called Sultans, Ameers, or Imams, who today as of old are constantly fighting among themselves for control. Aden, the island of Perim, in the Strait of Bab-el-Mendeb, and Socotra are under English authority.

<p>The fauna and flora of Arabia have not been as yet carefully investigated and studied. The most commonly known flora-products are the date-palm, of about forty varieties, coffee, aromatic and medicinal plants, gums, balsams, etc. The fauna is still more imperfectly known. Among the wild animals are the lion and panther (both at present scarce), the wolf, wild boar, jackal, gazelle, fox, monkey, wild cow, or white antelope, ibex, horned viper, cobra, hawk, and ostrich. The chief domestic animals are the ass, mule, sheep, goat, dog, and above all the horse and the camel.

<p>The actual population of Arabia is a matter of conjecture, no regular or official census having ever been undertaken. According to the most modern and acceptable authorities, the population cannot be less than eight, or more than twelve, millions, all of whom are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>. The personal appearance of the Arab is rather attractive. He is as a rule, undersized in stature, dark in complexion, especially in the South, with hair black, copious, and coarse; the eyes are dark and oval, the nose aquiline, and the features regular and well-formed. The ordinary life of the Arabs is simple and monotonous, usually out-of-doors and roving. They are usually peaceful, generous, hospitable, and <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalrous</a>, but jealous and revengeful. In later times, however, they have greatly deteriorated.
<h2>Modern explorations of Arabia</h2>

<p>Up to a century and a half ago our information concerning Arabia was based mainly on Greek and Latin writers, such as Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy, and others. This was meagre and unsatisfactory. The references to Arabia found in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were even more so. Hence our best sources of information are Arabic writers and geographers, such as Hamadani's "Arabian Peninsula," Bekri and Yaqut's geographical and historical dictionaries, and similar works. These, although extremely valuable, contain fabulous and legendary traditions, partly based on native popular legends and partly on Jewish and rabbinical fancies. The cuneiform inscriptions of Assyria have also thrown great and unexpected light on the early history of Arabia. But above all, mention must be made of the researches and discoveries of scholars like Hal&eacute;vy, Mueller, Glaser, Hommel, Winckler, and others. The first <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> scientific explorer of Arabia was C. Niebuhr, who, in 1761-64, by the order of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> government, undertook an expedition into the Arabian peninsula. He was followed, in 1799, by Reinaud, the English agent of the East <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> Company. The Russian scholar U.J. Seetzen undertook a similar expedition in 1808-11, and for the first time copied several South-Arabian inscriptions in the district of Himyar. In 1814-16, J.L. Burckhardt, a <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>, and probably the most distinguished of Arabian explorers, made a journey to Hijaz and completed the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Mecca and Medina. Burckhardt's information is copious, interesting, and accurate. Captain W.R. Wellsted made (in 1834-35) a journey into Oman and Hadramaut; and Ch. J. Cruttenden completed, in 1838, a similar journey from Mokha to Sana, copying several South-Arabian inscriptions, which R&ouml;diger and Gesenius attempted to decipher.



<p>Then came the German, Adolf von Wrede, who, in 1843, visited Wady Doan and other parts of Hadramaut, discovering and copying an important inscription of five long lines. In 1843 Thomas Joseph Arnaud made a very bold and successful journey from Sana to Marib, the capital of the ancient kingdom of the Sabeans, and collected about fifty-six inscriptions. In 1845-48, G. Wallin travelled through Hayil, Medina, and Taima, proceeding from west to east. In 1853 Richard Burton, the famous translator of the "Arabian Nights," undertook a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Mecca and Medina, and, in 1877 and 1878, twice visited the land of <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Midian</a>, in North Arabia. In 1861 a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, Jacob Saphir, visited Yemen, where he found several Jewish settlements, and other parts of Arabia; while in 1862-63, the English ex-Jesuit, W. Gifford Palgrave, made his memorable tour from the Dead Sea to Qatif and Oman, visiting the great north-western territory between the Sinaitic peninsula, the Euphrates, Hayil, Medina, Nejd, and practically the whole of central Arabia, till then unknown to scholars and travellers. Colonel Pelly visited central Arabia in 1865, and in 1869 Joseph Hal&eacute;vy, the great <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a> and the pioneer of Sabean philology, in the guise of a poor <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, explored Yemen and south Arabia, copying about 700, mostly very short, inscriptions. He advanced as far as the South-Arabian Jof, the territory of the ancient Mineans. In 1870-71, H. von Maltzan made a few short trips from Aden along the coast, and in 1876-78 Charles Doughty made his famous tour to Mada in Salih, Havil, Taima, Khaibar, Boraida, Onaiza, and Tayif, where he discovered several Nabataean, Lihyanian, or Tamudic, Minean and so-called proto-Arabic inscriptions. In 1877-80 the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> Renzo Manzoni made three excursions to Sana, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> capital of Yemen. In 1878-79, Lady Anne Blunt, Lord Byron's granddaughter, together with her husband, Sir Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, made a tour from <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> through the North-Arabian Jof, the Nefud <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and Hayil. In the years 1882-84 the Austrian explorer, Edward Glaser, made his first and very fruitful expedition to southern Arabia, where he discovered and copied numerous old Arabian inscriptions, and in 1883-84 Charles Huber together with Julius Euting, the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> epigraphist of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, undertook a joint expedition to northern Arabia, discovering the famous Aramaic inscriptions of Taima (sixth century B.C.). In 1885, Ed. Glaser made his second journey to southern Arabia collecting several Minean inscriptions; and in 1887-88 made his third expedition, which proved to be the most successful expedition yet undertaken, as far as epigraphical results are concerned.

<p>The inscriptions discovered and copied were over 400, the most valuable among them being the so-called "Dam-inscription," of 100 lines (fifth and sixth centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Era), and the "Sirwah inscription," of about 1,000 words (c. 550 B.C.). His fourth expedition took place in 1892-94, and was fruitful and rich in Arabic epigraphy. Leo Hirsch, of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, visited, in 1893, Hadramaut, and so did Theodore Bent and his wife in 1893-94. In 1896-97, the distinguished Arabic scholar, Count Carlo Landberg, visited the coast of South Arabia, making special studies of the modern Arabic dialects of those regions, besides other geographical and epigraphical researches. In 1898-99 the expedition of the Vienna Academy to Shabwa was organized and conducted by Count Landberg and D. H. Mueller which, however, owing to several difficulties and disagreements, did not accomplish the desired results. Other expeditions have since engaged in the active work of exploration. The results of all these expeditions have been threefold: geographical, epigraphical, and historical. These results have opened the way not only to fresh views and studies concerning the various ancient South-Arabian dialects, such as Minean, Sabean, or Himyarite, Hadramautic, and Katabanian, but have also shed unexpected light on the history of the old South-Arabian kingdoms and dynasties. These same discoveries have also thrown considerable light on <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> history on early Hebrew religion and worship, and on Hebrew and comparative <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> philology.
<h2>Arabia and the Old Testament</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> references to Arabia are scanty. The term <em>Arab</em> itself, as the name of a particular country and nation, is found only in later <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> writings, i.e. not earlier than Jeremias (sixth century B.C.). In older writings the term <em>Arab</em> is used only as an appellative, meaning "desert," or "people of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>," or "nomad" in general. The name for Arabia in the earliest <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> writings is either Ismael, or <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a> (A.V., Ishmael, or <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Midian</a>) as in the twenty-fifth chapter of Genesis, which is a significant indication of the relative antiquity of that remarkable chapter. The meaning of the term Arab can be either that of "Nomad," or "the Land of the Setting Sun," i.e. the West, it being situated to the west of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, which was considered to be the Biblical record of <a href="../bible/gen011.htm">Genesis 11</a>, as the traditional starting point of the earliest <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> migrations. By the ancient Hebrews, however, the land of Arabia was called "the Country of the East," and the Arabs were termed "Children of the East," as the Arabian peninsula lay to the east of Palestine.

<p>According to the genealogical table of the tenth chapter of Genesis, Cham's (A.V., Ham) <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> was Chush. Chush (A.V., <a href="../cathen/04575c.htm">Cush</a>) had five sons whose names are identical with several regions in Arabia. Thus the name of Sebha &mdash; probably the same as Sheba, or Saba &mdash; situated on the west coast of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, occurs only three times in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. The second is Hevila in northern Arabia, or as Glaser prefers in the district of Yemen and al-Kasim. The third is Regma (A.V., Raamah) in south-western Arabia, mentioned in the Sabean inscriptions. The fourth is Sabatacha, in southern Arabia, and as far east as Oman. The fifth is Sabatha (A.V., Sabtah), or better Sabata, the ancient capital of Hadramaut, in South Arabia. Regma's two sons, Saba and Dadan (A.V., Sheba and Dedan), or Daidan, are also two Arabian geographical names, the first being the famous Saba (A.V., Sheba) of the Book of Kings, whose Queen visited Solomon, while the second is near <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a> or, as Glaser suggests, north of Medina. In v. 28 of the same Genesiac chapter, Saba is said to be a son of Jectan (A.V., Joktan), and so, also, Elmodad, Asarmoth, Hevila, <a href="../cathen/11259b.htm">Ophir</a> (A.V., Almodad, Hazarmaveth, Havilah, etc., which are equally Arabian geographical names), while in chapter xxv, 3, both Saba and Dadan are represented as grandsons of Abraham.

<p>The episode of Sarai's handmaid, Agar (A.V., Hagar), and her son, Ismael (A.V., Ishmael), is well known. According to this, Ismael is the real ancestor of the majority of Arabian tribes, such as: Nabajoth, <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">Cedar</a>, Abdeel, Mabsam, Masma, Duma, Massa, Hadar, Thema, Jethur, and Cedma (A.V., Nebaijoth, Kedar, Abdeel, Mibsam, Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah, respectively). Equally well known are the stories of the <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianite</a>, or Ismaelite, merchants who bought Joseph from his brethren, that of the forty years' wandering of the Hebrew tribes over the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Arabia, of the Queen of Saba, etc. In later <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> times we read of Nehemias (A.V., Nehemiah), who suffered much from the enmity of an Arab sheikh, Gossem (A.V., Geshem), or better Gashmu or Gushamu [Nehemiah (in <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay Version</a>, II Esdras), ii, 19; vi, 6], and he also enumerates the Arabs in the list of his opponents (iv, 7). In II Paralipomenon (A.V., Chronicles) we are told (xvii, 11) that the Arabians brought tribute to King Josaphat (A.V., Jehoshaphat). The same chronicler tells us, also, how <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> punished the wicked Joram by means of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> and the Arabians, who were beside the Ethiopians (<a href="../bible/2ch021.htm#vrs16">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>), and how he helped the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Ozias (A.V., Uzziah) in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the "Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal" (xxvi, 7). The Arabians mentioned here are in all probability the Nabataeans of northern Arabia; as our author wrote in the second or third century B.C.
<h2>The north-Arabian <em>musri</em> and the Old Testament</h2>

<p>The cuneiform inscriptions of Assyria have thrown considerable light on various geographical localities in North Arabia, having important bearing on the history of the ancient Hebrews and on the critical study of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. The importance of these new facts and researches has of late assumed very bewildering proportions, the credit for which unmistakably belongs to Winckler, Hommel, and Cheyne. It is needless to say that however ingenious these hypotheses may appear to be they are not as yet entitled to be received without caution and hesitation. Were we to believe, in fact, the elaborate theories of these eminent scholars, a great part of the historical events of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> should be transferred from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> into Arabia; for, according to the latest speculations of these scholars, many of the passages in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> which, until recently, were supposed to refer to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (in Hebrew, <em>Misraim</em>) and to <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> (in Hebrew, <em>Kush</em>) do not really apply to them but to two regions of similar names in North Arabia, called in the Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions Musri, or Musrim, and Chush, respectively. They hold that partly by means of editorial manipulation and partly by reason of corruption in the text, and in consequence of the faded memory of long-forgotten events and countries, these two archaic North-Arabian geographical names became transformed into names of similar sound, but better known, belonging to a different geographical area namely, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Misraim and the African Chush, or <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>.

<p>According to this theory, Agar, Sarai's handmaid (Gen. XVI, 1) was not Misrite or <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, but Musrite, i.e. from Musri, in northern Arabia. Abraham (<a href="../bible/gen012.htm#vrs10">Genesis 12:10</a>) did not go down into Misraim, or <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where he is said to have received from the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> a gift of men-servants and handmaids, but into Misrim, or Musri, in northern Arabia. Joseph, when bought by the Ismaelites, or <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianites</a>, i.e. Arabs, was not brought into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (Misraim), but to Musri, or Misrim, in north Arabia, which was the home of the <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianites</a>. In <a href="../bible/1sa030.htm#vrs13">1 Samuel 30:13</a>, we should not read "I am a young man of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> [Misraim], slave of an Amalecite," but of Musri in north Arabia. In <a href="../bible/1ki003.htm#vrs1">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#vrs1">11:1</a>, Solomon is said to have married the daughter of an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> king, which is extremely improbable; for Misrim in north Arabia, and not the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Misraim, is the country whose king's daughter Solomon married. In <a href="../bible/1sa004.htm#vrs30">1 Samuel 4:30</a>, the wisdom of Solomon is compared to the "wisdom of all the children of the east country [i.e. the Arabians] and all the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>." But the last-mentioned country, they say, is not [<a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> but, as the parallelism requires, <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, or Musri, whose proverbial wisdom is frequently alluded to in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. In <a href="../bible/1ki010.htm#vrs28">1 Kings 10:28 sq.</a>, horses are said to have been brought from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> but horses were very scarce in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, while very numerous and famous in Arabia. The same emendation can be made in at least a dozen more <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> passages. The most revolutionary result, however, would follow if we applied the same theory to the famous sojourn of the Hebrews in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; for it is self-evident that if the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> sojourned not in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Misraim, but in the north Arabian Musri, and from thence fled into <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, which was nearby, the result to ancient Hebrew history and religion would be of the most revolutionary character. Similar emendation has been applied with more or less success to the many passages where Chush, or <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, occurs, such as <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs13">Genesis 2:13</a>; <a href="../bible/gen010.htm#vrs6">10:6</a>; <a href="../bible/num012.htm#vrs1">Numbers 12:1</a>; <a href="../bible/jdg003.htm#vrs10">Judges 3:10</a>; <a href="../bible/2sa018.htm#vrs21">2 Samuel 18:21</a>; <a href="../bible/isa020.htm#vrs3">Isaiah 20:3</a>; <a href="../bible/isa045.htm#vrs14">45:14</a>; <a href="../bible/hab003.htm#vrs7">Habakkuk 3:7</a>; <a href="../bible/psa086.htm#vrs4">Psalm 86:4</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch014.htm#vrs9">2 Chronicles 14:9</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch021.htm#vrs16">21:16</a>, etc.

<p>Another important geographical name frequently mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and in all instances referred, till recently, to <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, is Assur (abbreviated into Sur). A country of similar name has also been discovered in Arabia. In this last view Winckler and Cheyne are warmly supported by Hommel, by whom it was first suggested. Cheyne, furthermore, has pushed these identifications to such extremities as to transplant the whole historical and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to the Nejeb, the country of Jerameel in northern Arabia. According to him the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Elias, Eliseus, Amos, Osee (A.V., Hosea), Ezechiel (A.V., <a href="../bible/eze000.htm">Ezekiel</a>), Joel, and Abdias (A.V., Obadiah) are all North Arabians; and all the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> either came from that country or have it constantly in view. <a href="../bible/isa040.htm">Isaiah 40</a>-<a href="../bible/isa055.htm">55</a> was, according to him, composed in northern Arabia; Ezechiel also suffered <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and prophesied there; and hundreds of personal and geographical proper names in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are, according to him, intentional or accidental corruptions of Jerameel, Arabia, and Nejeb. However great our appreciation of Winckler's and Cheyne's ingenuity and learning may be, and allowing that their theories are not entirely lacking in plausibility, yet they have received, so far, little support and encouragement from the majority of Biblical scholars and critics. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the new theories, in some of their applications, give highly satisfactory results, but in their extreme form they are, to say the least, premature and ultra-radical.
<h2>Early history of Arabia till the rise of Islam</h2>

<p>To the historian, the earliest history of Arabia is a blank page, little or nothing being historically known and ascertained as to the origin migrations, history, and political vicissitudes of the Arabian nation. <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> traditions concerning the early history of the peninsula are mostly legendary and highly coloured, although partly based on Biblical data and rabbinical traditions. Hardly less unsatisfactory are the many references found in Greek and Latin writers. The mention of Arab tribes, under the various forms of Arabi, Arubu, Aribi, and possibly Urbi, frequently occurs in the Assyrian inscriptions as early as the ninth century B.C., and their country is spoken of as seldom or never traversed by any conqueror, and as inhabited by wild and independent tribes. We read, e.g., that in 854 B.C. Salmanasar II (A.V., Shalmanezer) met in battle a confederation in which was Gindibu the Arab with one hundred camels. A few years later Theglathphalasar III (A.V., Tiglathpileser) undertook an expedition into Arabia; and in the latter half of the eighth century B.C. we find Assyrian influence extending over the north-west and east of the peninsula. One century later a number of Arabian tribes of inner Arabia were defeated by Asarhaddon (A.V., Esarhaddon) at Bazu. Assurbanipal also repeatedly speaks of his various successful expeditions into and conquests in the lands of Musri, Magan, Meluhha, and Chush in Arabia. In the Behistun inscription of the Persian king Darius, Arabia (Arabaya) is mentioned as a subject land. The numerous South-Arabian inscriptions thus far discovered and deciphered by Hal&eacute;vy, Winckler, D. H. Mueller, Hommel, Ed. Glaser, and others do not throw much light on the early history of Arabia. But the epigraphic evidences and the many ruins still extant in various parts of that peninsula unmistakably show that a highly developed civilization must have existed among the ancient Arabs at a very early age.

<p>The two most important kingdoms of ancient Arabia are that of the Mineans (the <em>m'dbzm</em> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>) and that of the Sabeans, whence the Queen of Saba came to pay her homage of respect and admiration to King Solomon. A third kingdom was that of Kataban, a fourth, Hadramaut, as well as those of Lihyan, Raidan, Habashah, and others. The Minean Kingdom seems to have flourished in southern Arabia as early as 1200 B.C., and from the various Minean inscriptions found in northern Arabia they seem to have extended their power even to the north of the peninsula. Their principal cities were Main, Karnan, and Yatil. The Sabean, or Himyaritic, Kingdom (the Homeritae of the classics) flourished either contemporarily (D. H. Mueller) or after (Glaser, Hommel) the Minean. Their capital city was Marib (the Mariaba of the Arabian classics) famous for its dam, the breaking of which is often mentioned by later Arabic poets and traditions as the immediate cause of the fall of the Sabean power. The Sabeans, after two centuries of repeated and persistent attacks, finally succeeded in overthrowing the rival Minean Kingdom. Their power, however lasted till about 300 A.D., when they were defeated and conquered by the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a>.

<p>The Katabanian state, with its capital, Taima, was ruined some time in the second century after Christ, probably by the Sabeans. Towards the beginning of our Era the three most prominent and powerful Arab states were the Sabean, the Himyarite, and that of Hadramaut. In the fourth century the Himyarites, aided by the Sassanian kings of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, appear to have had a controlling power in southern Arabia, while the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a> were absolute rulers of Yemen. These, however, although pressed by Himyar and temporarily confined to the Tehamah district (A.D. 378), succeeded, in 525, with the help of the Byzantine Emperor, in overthrowing the Himyarite power, killing the king and becoming the absolute rulers of South Arabia. In 568 the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a> were finally driven out of Arabia, and the power restored to the Yemenites; this vassal kingdom of the Persian Empire lasted until the year 634, when it was absorbed, together with all the other Arabian States, by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> conquest.

<p>Such was the political condition of southern Arabia previous to the time of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>. Of central Arabia little or nothing is known. In northern and north-western Arabia there flourished the Nabataean Kingdom, the people of which, though Arabian by race, nevertheless spoke Aramaic. The Nabataeans must have come from other parts of Arabia to the North some time about the fifth century B.C., for at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> period we find them already well established in that region. Shortly before the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Era, Antigonus and Ptolemy had in vain attempted to gain a footing in Arabia; and Pompey himself, victorious elsewhere, was checked on its frontiers. During the reign of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, Aelius Gallus, the Roman Prefect of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, with an army composed of 10,000 Roman infantry, 500 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and 100 Nabataeans, undertook an expedition against the province of Yemen. He took by assault the city of Nejran, on the frontier of Yemen, and advanced as far as Marib, the capital of Yemen, but, owing to the resistance of the Arabs and the disorganization of his army, which was unaccustomed to the heat of the tropical climate of Arabia, he was forced to retreat to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> without accomplishing any permanent and effective conquest. Later attempts to conquer the country were made by Roman governors and generals under <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> and Severus, but these were mostly restricted to the neighbourhood of the Syrian frontiers, such as Nabatea, Bosra, <a href="../cathen/11777b.htm">Petra</a>, <a href="../cathen/11433a.htm">Palmyra</a>, and the Sinaitic peninsula.

<p>Another North-Arabian kingdom was that of Hira, situated in the north-easterly frontier of Arabia adjoining Irak, or <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>. Its kings governed the western shore of the lower Euphrates, from the neighbourhood of Babylon down to the confines of Nejd, and along the coast of the Persian Gulf. It was founded in the second century of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Era and lasted about 424 years, i.e. till it was absorbed by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> conquest. The kings of Hira were more or less vassal to their powerful neighbours, the Sassanian kings of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, paying them allegiance and tribute. Another Arabian state was that of Ghassan whose kings ruled over considerable part of northwestern Arabia, lower <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and Hijaz. It was founded in the first century of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Era and lasted till the time of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>. The Kingdom of Ghassan was frequently harassed by Roman and Byzantine encroachments, and by unequal alliances. In both these kingdoms (i.e. Hirah and Ghassan) <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> made rapid progress, and numerous <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities, with <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, flourished there. (For CHRISTIANITY IN ARABIA, see below.)

<p>Another Arabian kingdom was that of Kindah, originally from Irak, or north-eastern Arabia, and Mesopotamia. This rather short-lived and weak kingdom began about the fifth century of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Era and ended with <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, i.e. about one century and a half later. Its power and authority extended for a time over the whole northern section of Nejd and as far south as Oman. Besides these independent kingdoms, various Arab tribes, such as that of Koreish, to which <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> belonged, Rabeeah, Qays, Hawazin, Tamim, and others, were constantly endeavouring to assume independent power and authority. But their efforts and hopes were finally and permanently shattered by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> conquest, which put an end to all tribal factions and preponderances by uniting them all into one religious and political kingdom, the Kingdom of Islam.
<h2>Christianity in Arabia</h2>

<p>The origin and progress of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Arabia is, owing to the lack of sufficiently authenticated historical documents, involved in impenetrable obscurity, and only detached episodes in one part or another of the peninsula can be grouped together and studied. References to various <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionary enterprises in the north and south of the country, found in early ecclesiastical historians and Fathers, such as <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Rufinus, <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, Nicephorus, <a href="../cathen/10225a.htm">Metaphrastes</a>, Theodoret, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and Jerome, are valuable, but to be used with caution, inasmuch as a lamentable confusion, common to all writers of that time between Arabia proper and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, seems to have crept into their writings.

<p>Furthermore, no proper discrimination is made by any of them among the various traditions at their disposal. More abundant and trustworthy information may be gathered from <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and Jacobite writers, as each of these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> has had its own sphere of influence in the peninsula, and particularly in the northern kingdoms of Hira and Ghassan. Arabic historians (all of post-Islamic times) are very interesting in their allusions to the same, but are at variance with one another. Indigenous <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature and monuments, except perhaps one inscription of the fifth century after Christ found by Glaser, and the ruins of a supposed church, afterwards turned into a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> temple, are utterly wanting. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Arabia had three in centres in the north-west, north-east, and south-west of the peninsula. The first embraces the Kingdom of Ghassan (under Roman rule), the second that of Hira (under Persian power), and the third the kingdoms of Himyar, Yemen, and Najran (under <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> rule). As to central and south-east Arabia, such as Nejd and Oman, it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> made any advance there.
<h3>North Arabian Christianity</h3>

<p>According to the majority of the Fathers and historians of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the origin of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in northern Arabia is to be traced back to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, who in his Epistle to the Galatians, speaking of the period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> immediately following his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, says: "Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned to Damascus" (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>). What particular region of Arabia was visited by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>, the length of his stay, the motive of his journey, the route followed, and the things he accomplished there are not specified. His journey may have lasted as long as one year, and the place visited may have been either the country of the Nabataeans or the Sinaitic peninsula, or better, as Harnack remarks, "not to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, but rather to a district south of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> where he could not expect to come across any <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>" (Expansion of Christianity, 1905, II, 301). Jerome, however, suggests that he may have gone to a tribe where his mission was unsuccessful as regards visible results. Zwemer's suggestion [ Arabia, the Cradle of Islam (1900), 302-303] that the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koranic</a> allusion to a certain Nebi Salih, or the Prophet Salih, who is said to have come to the Arabs preaching the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and was not listened to, and who, consequently, in leaving them said: "O my people, I did preach unto you the message of my Lord, and I gave you good advice, but ye <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not sincere advisers" (Surah vii), refers to Paul of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> &mdash; this theory need hardly be considered.

<p>In the light of the legend of Abgar of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, however, and considering the fact that the regions lying to the north-west and north-east of Arabia, under Roman and Persian rule respectively, were in constant contact with the northern Arabs, among whom <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had already made fast and steady progress, we may reasonably assume that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionary activity cannot have neglected the attractive mission field of northern Arabia. In the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> (ii, 11) we even read of the presence of Arabians on the day of Pentecost, and Arabs were quite numerous in the Parthian Empire and around <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. The cruel persecutions, furthermore, which raged in the Roman and Persian Empires against the followers of Christ must have forced many of these to seek refuge on the safer soil of northern Arabia.
<h3>Christianity in Ghassan and Northwest Arabia</h3>

<p>The Kingdom of Ghassan, in north-western Arabia, adjacent to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, comprised a very extensive tract of territory and a great number of Arab tribes whose first migrations there must have taken place as early as the time of Alexander the Great. Towards the third and fourth centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Era these tribes already formed a confederation powerful enough to cause trouble to the Roman Empire, which formed with them alliances and friendships in order to counterbalance the influence of the Mesopotamian Arabs of Hira, who were under Persian rule. The kings of Ghassan trace their descent from the tribe of Azd, in Yemen. Gafahah, their first king, dispossessed the original dynasty, and is said to have been confirmed in his conquest by the Roman governor of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Their capital city was Balka till the time of the second Harith, when it was supplanted by Petra and Sideir. Although living a nomadic life and practically independent, with "no dwelling but the tent, no intrenchment but the sword, no law but the traditionary song of their bards," these Arabs were under the nominal, but quite effective, control of the Romans as early as the time of Pompey. Such Syrian Arabs always looked upon the Romans as their best and most powerful defenders and protectors against the Sassanian dynasty of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, by which they were constantly oppressed and molested.

<p>The Nabataean Kingdom, which comprised the Sinaitic peninsula, the sea-coast to the Gulf of Akaba, to Al-Haura, and as far as Damascus and Hijaz, and which was annexed to the Roman Empire in A.D. 105, comprised also many Arab tribes which were for a long time governed by their own sheikhs and princes, their stronghold being the country around Bosra and <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>. These sheikhs were acknowledged as such by the Roman emperors who gave them the title of <em>phylarch</em>. The ever increasing number and importance of these tribes and of those living in the Ghassanide territory were such that in 531, by the consent and authority of the Emperor Justinian, a real Arab-Roman kingdom was formed under the rule of the kings of Ghassan, whose power and authority extended over all the Arabs of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> and north-western Arabia. Another Syro-Arabian Kingdom, in which Arab tribes were very numerous, is that of <a href="../cathen/11433a.htm">Palmyra</a>, which retained for a long time its independence and resisted all encroachments. Under Odenathus the Palmyrene kingdom flourished, and it reached the zenith of its power under his wife and successor, the celebrated Zenobia. After her defeat by <a href="../cathen/02108b.htm">Aurelian</a> (272), <a href="../cathen/11433a.htm">Palmyra</a> and its dependencies became a province of the Roman Empire.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> must have been introduced among the Syrian Arabs at a very early period; if not among the tribes living in the interior of the Syro-Arabian <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, certainly among those whose proximity brought them into continuous social and commercial contact with <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Rufinus (Hist. Ecclesiastica, II, 6) tells us of a certain Arabian Queen, Mavia, or Maowvia (better, Mu'awiyah), who, after having repeatedly fought against the Romans, accepted peace on condition that a certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, called Moses, should be appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> over her tribe. This took place during the reign of <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> (about 374), who was greatly inclined to <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. Moses lived a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> life in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and accordingly he was brought to Alexandria in order to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as the Bedouin queen required. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> was then a certain Lucius, accused of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. Moses refused to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and was so obdurate in his refusal that it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the emperor to bring from exile a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and send him to the queen.

<p>Caussin de Perceval (Histoire des Arabes avant l'Islamisme, etc., II, 215) affirms that towards the beginning of the fourth century, and during the reign of Djabala I, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was again preached, and accepted by another Arab tribe. <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomenus</a>, in fact, relates that before the time of <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> an Arab prince, whom he calls Zacome, or Zocum, having obtained a son through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and all his tribe with him. <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens Christianus, II, 851) calls this prince Zaracome and places him under the reign of Constantine or of one of his sons. No prince of such name, however, occurs in any Arabic historian although Caussin de Perceval suggests his identification with a certain Arcan, of the tribe of Giafnah, who was in all probability a prominent chief of Ghassan.

<p>Another source of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> propaganda among the northern Arabs was undoubtedly the many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> scattered in the Syro-Arabian <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, for whom the Arab tribes had great respect, and to whose solitary abodes they made numerous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>. Jerome and Theodoret explicitly affirm that the life and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/07347a.htm">St. Hilarion</a> and of St. Simeon the Stylite made a deep impression on the Bedouin Arabs. Many tribes accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at the hands of the latter Saint, while many others became so favourably disposed towards it that they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Cyrillus of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a> (sixth century), in his life of <a href="../cathen/05630b.htm">Saint Euthymius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Pharan, tells the story of the conversion of an entire Arab tribe which, towards 420, had migrated from along the Euphrates into Palestine. Their chief was a certain Aspebaetos. He had a son afflicted with paralysis, who at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> completely recovered. Aspebaetos himself was afterwards <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> over his own tribe by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (see below). These detached facts clearly indicate that during the fourth fifth, and sixth centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Era, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> must have been embraced by many Arabs, and especially by the tribe of Ghassan, which is celebrated by Arab historians and poets as being from very early times devotedly attached to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It was of this tribe that the proverb became current: "They were lords in the days of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> [i.e. before <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>] and stars of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>." (Zwemer, Arabia, the Cradle of Islam, 304.)

<p>The numerous inscriptions collected in northern <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> by Waddington, <a href="../cathen/15501b.htm">de Vogue</a>, Clermont Ganneau, and others also clearly indicate the presence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> elements in the Syro-Arabian population of that region and especially around Bosra. In the days of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> there were numerous <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in the towns lying south of the Hauran, and these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were once grouped together in a single synod (Harnack, Expansion of Christianity, II, 301). As early as the third century this part of Syro-Arabia was already well known as the "mother of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>." Towards the year 244 <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> converted to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> Beryllus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bosra, who was a confessed anti-Trinitarian (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.20</a>); and two years earlier (242) a provincial synod of Arabia was held in connection with the proceedings against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, which decided in his favour. This great teacher in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was also personally known at that time to the Arabian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; for about the year 215 he had travelled as far as Arabia at the request of the Roman governor, before whom he laid his views (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, op. cit., VI, 19, and Harnack, op. cit., 301). In 250 the same teacher went to Arabia for the second time to combat certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who taught that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> died with the body, but that it would rise up again with it on the Judgment Day (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, op. cit., VI, 39).

<p>The "Onomasticon" of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> (325) also indicate the presence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, during the days of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, in Arabia, along the Dead Sea, and around Qariathaim, near Madaba (Harnack, op. cit., 302-303). At the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> there were present six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of Arabia: the Bishops of Bosra, Philadelphia, Jabrudi, Sodom, Betharma, and Dionysias (Wright, Early Christianity in Arabia, 73, and Harnack, op. cit., 303). One tradition makes an Arabian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Zanaatha (Sanaa?) attend Nicaea. The sheikh-bishop Aspebaetos was present at the Council of Ephesus (431), and one of his successors, <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> by name, became, in 518, a suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Duchesne, Les &eacute;glises s&eacute;par&eacute;es, 343). A certain Eustathius, called "Bishop of the Sarrasins," assisted at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. In 458 he was still <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>. At the second Council of Ephesus (449) there was present another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the "allied Arabs," named Auxilaos. Another Arabian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was that of the island of Jotabe, near the Gulf of Akabah; and a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Jotabe, by the name of Anastasius was present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (536). At the First and Second Councils of Constantinople, we read of the presence of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Bosra, whose authority is said to have extended over twenty churches or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> (Assemani, Bibliotheca Orientalis, III, Part II, 598 sqq.). Many of these Arabian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were undoubtedly infected with <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, and later on with <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, the latter <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> having been greatly favoured and even protected by the Ghassanide princes.

<p>The above sketch clearly shows that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Arab tribes were scattered through all <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, and northern Arabia, having their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and churches. But it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether this North-Arabian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> formed any national <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as many of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were dependent on the Greek Metropolitans of Tyrus, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, and on the Patriarchs of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Antioch.
<h3>Christianity in Hira and Northeast Arabia</h3>

<p>According to Arabic writers and historians, the first Arab migration into Hira took place about A.D. 192 by the tribe of Tenukh and under the leadership of its chief, Malik ibn Fahm. This tribe was shortly afterwards followed by other tribes, such as those of Iyad, Azd, Qud&acirc;'ah, and others, most of whom settled around Anbar, and who afterwards built for themselves the city of Hira, not far from the modern Kufa on the Euphrates, in southern <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, that as early as the time of Alexander, and towards the first century of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Era, northern and southern Mesopotamia were thickly inhabited by Arab tribes, who, about the third century, formed more than one-third of its population. These tribes were, of course, governed by their own chiefs and princes, subject, however, to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>.

<p>Tradition relates that under one of these princes of Hira, Imru'ul Qais I, who reigned from 288 to 338. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was first introduced into Hira and among the Mesopotamian Arabs. This, however, is not correct, for, from the Syriac <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> Addai and Mari, and other Syriac documents, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced into Mesopotamia and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, if not at the end of the first, certainly towards the middle of the second century. The Acts of the Persian <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and the history of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and Madain (i.e. Seleucia and Ctesiphon) unmistakably show that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, although fiercely <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and opposed by the Sassanian kings of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, made rapid progress in these and the neighbouring regions, and, consequently, the Arabs of Hira cannot have entirely missed the beneficial effects of the new religion. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that during the reign of Hormuz I (271-273) several hundred <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> captives were brought from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and other Roman provinces into Irak and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>. According to Tabari (ed. N&ouml;ldeke, 24), the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Hira were called <em>'Ib&acirc;d</em>, or "Worshippers," i.e. "worshipers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," in opposition to "pagans" (Labourt, Le Christianisme dans l'empire perse sous la dynastie sassanide, 1904, 206).

<p>The condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and Mesopotamia in the early centuries is well known to us from the numerous Acts of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and other Syriac documents still extant, but that of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Arabs of Hira is very obscure. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, that towards the end of the fourth, and the beginning of the fifth, century <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> attained there considerable success and popularity. Nu'm&acirc;n I, King of Hira, who reigned from 390 to 418, is said to have been, if not a follower of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, certainly a great protector of his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> subjects. During his reign the Kingdom of Hira rose to great power and celebrity, for his domain extended over all the Arabs of Mesopotamia, over <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, along the Euphrates down to the Persian Gulf, and as far south as the islands of Bahrein. He caused great and magnificent buildings to be erected, among which were the two famous castles of Khawarnig and Sidir, celebrated in Arabic poetry for their unsurpassed splendour and beauty. The city of Hira was then, as afterwards, called after his own name, i.e. "the Hira of Nu'm&acirc;n," or "the city of Nu'm&acirc;n," and his deeds and exploits are justly celebrated by Arab writers, historians, and poets. Before and during the reign of this prince, the Persian monarchs, from Shapor to Kobad, had relentlessly <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the new religion was naturally imparted to their vassal kings and allies, principal among whom was Nu'm&acirc;n.

<p>In 410 St. Simeon the Stylite, who was in all probability of Arab descent, retired to the Syro-Arabian <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. There the fame of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> attracted a great many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> from all <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Mesopotamia, and northern Arabia, many of whom were Nu'm&acirc;n's subjects. The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> example and eloquent exhortations of the Syrian <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> induced many of these <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Arabs to embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and Nu'm&acirc;n began to fear lest his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> subjects might be led by their religion to <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to the service of the Romans. Accordingly, he forbade all <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the Syrian saint and all intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Romans, under penalty of instant death. On the night of the issue of the edict, St. Simeon is said to have appeared to him in a dream, threatening him with death if he did not revoke the edict and allow his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> subjects absolute religious freedom. Terrified and humbled, Nu'm&acirc;n revoked the order and became himself a sincere admirer of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which his fear of the Persian ling did not permit him to embrace. When the change of sentiment that had taken place in their prince was publicly known, the Arabs of his kingdom are said to have flocked in crowds to receive the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>. This memorable event seems to all appearances, to be historical; for it is related by Cosmas the Presbyter, who assures us that he heard it personally from a certain Roman general, Antiochus by name, to whom it was narrated by Nu'm&acirc;n himself (Assemani, Bibliotheca Orientalis, I, 247; and Wright, op. cit., 77). Hamza, Abul-Faraj of Isfahan (the author of Kitab-al-Agh&acirc;ni), Abulfeda, Nuwairi, Tabari, and Ibn Khaldun (quoted by Caussin de Perceval, Histoire des Arabes, etc., III, 234) relate that Nu'm&acirc;n abdicated the throne and retired to a religious and ascetic life, although he is nowhere expressly said to have become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. (See also J.E. Assemani, Acta Martyrum Orientalium, II, and Bibl. Orient., I, 276-278.)

<p>The greatest obstacle to the spread and success of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Hira was the immoderate <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the Sassanian monarchs towards the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of their empire and the fierce persecutions to which these were subjected. Encouraged and incited by these suzerains, the princes of Hira <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> more than once their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> subjects, destroyed their churches, and sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> virgins. One of these Princes, Mundhir ibn Imru'ul-Qais, to whom Dhu Nuwas was sent the news of the massacre of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Najran, in southern Arabia, sacrificed at the altar of the goddess Ouzza, the Arabian Venus, four hundred <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virgins (Tabari, ed. Noeldeke, 171). His wife, however, was a fervent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> of the royal family of Ghassan, Hind by name. She founded at Hira a famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> after her own name, in which many <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> resided and were buried. Yaqut, in his "Geographical Dictionary" (ed. Wuestenfeld) reproduces the dedicatory inscription which was placed at the entrance of the church. It runs as follows: "This church was built by Hind, the daughter of Harith ibn Amr ibn Hujr, the queen daughter of Kings, the mother of King Amr ibn Mundhir, the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the mother of His servant and the daughter of His servants [i.e. her son and her ancestors, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> kings of Ghassan], under the reign of the King of Kings, Khosroee Anoushirwan, in the times of Bishop Mar Ephrem. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> she built this church, forgive her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and have mercy on her and on her son. May He accept him and admit him into His abode of peace and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. That He may be with her and with her son in the centuries to come." (See Duchesne, Les &eacute;glises s&eacute;par&eacute;es, 350-351.)

<p>The inscription was written during the reign of her <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> son, Amr ibn Mundhir, who reigned after his <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> father, from 554 to 569. After him reigned his brother Nu'm&acirc;n ibn Qabus. This prince is said to have been led to embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by his admiration of the constancy and punctuality of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Syrian whom he had designed to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. "In a fit of <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> he had wantonly <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> two of his friends, and when sober, in <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">repentance</a> for his cruelty and in remembrance of their friendship, he erected <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> over their graves, and <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vowed</a> to moisten them once every year with the blood of an enemy. One of the first victims intended for the fulfilment of his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> was this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, who entreated the Mundhir to allow him a short space of time to return home for the purpose of acquitting himself of some <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> with which he had been entrusted; the boon was granted on his solemn promise to return at an appointed time. The time came and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Syrian was punctual to his word, and thus saved his life." (Wright, op. cit. 143, from Pococke, "Specimen Historiae Arabum," 75). After his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, Qabus melted down a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Venus of solid gold, which had been worshipped by his tribe, and distributed its gold produce among the poor (<a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a>, Hist. Eccl., VI, xxii). Following his example, many Arabs became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p>Qabus was succeeded by his brother, Mundhir ibn Mundhir, during whose reign <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> held sway once more among his subjects, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was kept in check. After him reigned Nu'm&acirc;n ibn Mundhir (580-595), who, towards the year 594, was <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. His granddaughter, Hind, who was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and of exceptional beauty, was married to the Arab poet 'Adi ibn Zayd. He saw her for the first time during a <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a> <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> in the church of Hira, and became infatuated with her. Nu'm&acirc;n was one of the last kings of his dynasty that reigned at Hira. One of his sons, Mundhir ibn Nu'm&acirc;n, lived in the time of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, whom he opposed at the head of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Arab army of Bahrein; but he fell in battle, in 633, while fighting the invading <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> army.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Hira professed both the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>; both <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> having had their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> within the same city. Bishops of Hira (in Syriac, <em>Hirtha de Tayyaye</em>, or "Hira of the Arabs") are mentioned as present at the various councils held in 410, 430, 485, 499, and 588. Towards the year 730 the Diocese of Hira was subdivided into three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> with three distinct <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> bearing the respective titles of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Akula, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kufa and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Arabs, or of the tribe of Ta'lab. From 686-724, Georgius, the famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Arabs, was still entitled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Tanukhites, of the Tayyaites, and of the Akulites, i.e. of the tribe of Tanoukh, of Tay, and of the district of Akula [Assemani, Bibl.

<h3>South Arabian Christianity: Himyar, Yemen and Najran</h3>

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Rufinus, Nicephorus, Theodoret, etc., followed by <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, Assemani, <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>, <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, Pagi, and others, the Apostle Bartholomew, while on his way to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (i.e. <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>), preached the Gospel in Arabia Felix, or Yemen, which was then, especially after the expedition of Aelius Gallus, a commercial country well known to the Romans, and in constant mercantile and political communication with <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> informs us that in the second century Pant&aelig;nus, master of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, instructed the Indians (Ethiopians) in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and Jerome adds further that this missionary was sent to them by Demetrius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, in consequence of a request made by them for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teacher. As the names <em>India</em> and <em>Indians</em> were applied by the Greek and Latin writers indiscriminately to Parthia, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a>, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, Libya, and Arabia, it may be reasonably inferred that the tradition in question is at the least vague and indefinite, although it is universally admitted that the <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> in question is <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, whence the Apostle may have easily crossed to Yemen; inasmuch as the Ethiopians and the Himyarites, or Yemenites, are both linguistically and ethnographically the same race.

<p>According to Nicephorus, the field of Pant&aelig;nus's mission was among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Yemen, whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have settled in various centres of southern Arabia after the ruin of the second Temple in order to escape the Roman <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Jerome adds, furthermore, that Pant&aelig;nus found among them the Hebrew Gospel of St. Matthew which they had received from their first Apostle, St. Bartholomew. Rufinus, Theodoret, and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> assert that during the reign of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> (312-337) a <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyrian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> named Meropius determined to visit the Himyarites in Arabia Felix. He was accompanied by two of his kinsmen (according to some, his two sons) and other disciples. On their return they were captured as enemies and were either slain or made captives, for at that time the Himyarites were in a state of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a>. Two members of the party, however, named &AElig;desius and Frumentius, respectively, were taken before the King of Himyar, who became favourably disposed towards them, appointing the first his cup-bearer, the other custodian of his treasures. At the death of the king, the two <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyrians</a> determined to return to their country, but were prevented by the queen regent, who requested them to remain and be the guardians of her infant son till he reached the proper age. They obeyed, and Frumentius, taking advantage of his power and position, caused a search to be made for the few <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who, he had heard, were scattered in the Himyarite Kingdom. He treated them kindly and built for them churches and places of worship.

<p>As soon as the young king ascended the throne, the two disciples returned to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, where Aedesius was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Frumentius went to Alexandria to inform the newly-elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, of the condition of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Himyar, and begged him to send them a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Whereupon Frumentius himself was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and sent, together with several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to the Himyarites where, with the aid and favour of the king, he increased the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and brought much prosperity to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. As Duchesne remarks ["Les &eacute;glises s&eacute;par&eacute;es" (1905), 311], the elevation of Frumentius must have taken place during the reign of <a href="../cathen/16027c.htm">Constantius</a>, and either shortly before 340, or shortly after 346; for during the interval <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> was absent from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and, as the stay of the two <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyrians</a> at the court of Himyar cannot have lasted less than fifteen years, it follows that Meropius's journey must have taken place between the years 320 and 325. The legend of Meropius and Frumentius, however, seems to refer to the evangelization of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> rather than to that of Himyar, or, if to that of Himyar, its conversion must have been only of an indirect and transitory character. To the mission of Frumentius may also refer the testimony of two Arabic writers quoted by Ouseley (Travels, I, 369-371; also Wright, Christianity in Arabia, 33), according to which the Arabs of Najran in Yemen, were first converted by a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> captured by some Arab robbers and taken to their country.

<p>Another <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mission to Himyar took place during the reign of <a href="../cathen/16027c.htm">Constantius</a> (337-361), who towards the year 356, chose Bishop Theophilus, the famous <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, to conduct an embassy to the court of Himyar. The eloquence of Theophilus so impressed the king that he became favourably disposed towards the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of his realm and built three churches for them, one at Dhafar (or Safar), another at Aden or at Sanaa, and the third at Hormuz, near the Persian Gulf. As the aim of the embassy was to ask the King of Himyar to grant freedom of worship to the Roman citizens in the Kingdom of Himyar, it follows that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> must have attained there a certain importance. According to Philostorgius, the king himself became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but this is improbable. At any rate, whether Theophilus succeeded in converting more Himyarites to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> or whether, as Assemani seems to believe, he simply perverted the already existing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a> cannot be determined. From the fact that the latest royal Himyarite inscription, couched in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> terms, bears the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 281, that local Jewish inscriptions date from 378, 448, 458, and 467, and that the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> inscription, discovered by Glaser and considered by Hommel &mdash; the latest Sabean inscription (it opens with the words: "In the power of the All-Merciful, and His <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> and the Holy Ghost"), dates only as late as 542-543 [Glaser, Skizze der Geschichte Arabiens (1889), 12 sqq.], it does not follow that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at the time of Theophilus had not attained any official position in Himyar, although it is undeniable that the two prevailing creeds were then <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a> and <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. Arab historians, such as Ibn Khallikan, Yaqut, Abulfeda, Ibn-al-Athir and especially the early biographers of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, unanimously affirm that towards the fourth and fifth centuries of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> flourished in Hira, Himyar, and Najran, and among many tribes of the North and South, Quda'ah, Bahrah, Tanukh, Taghlib, Tay. We are far, however, from accepting all these <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> testimonies concerning the origin and development of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in South Arabia as critically ascertained and conclusive. Fictitious elements and legendary traditions are undoubtedly ingredients of the original narratives, yet it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that a certain amount of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is contained in them.

<p>Positive traces of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization in southern Arabia first appear in the time of the Emperor Anastasius (491-518). John Diacrinomenos (P.G., LXXXVI, 212) relates that during this emperor's reign the Himyarites, who had become followers of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> since the time of the Queen of Sheba, or Saba, were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and received a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Silvanus by name, who was that writer's own uncle, and at whose instance he wrote his <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. It is not improbable that the testimony of Ibn Ishaq, the earliest and most authoritative biographer of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> (d. 770), according to which the first apostle of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Yemen was a poor Syrian mason named Phemion, who with a companion named Salih was captured by an Arab caravan and sold to a prominent Najranite, refers to this Silvanus. One of his first converts was a certain Abdallah ibn Thamir, who became a great miracle-worker and thus succeeded in converting the town of Najran to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">religion of Christ</a> (Tabari, ed. Noeldeke, 178). According to Hal&eacute;vy (Archives des missions, VII, 40), even at the present time there is still a mosque in Najran dedicated to this Abdallah ibn Thamir. Ibn Khaldun, on the other hand, asserts that as early as the latter half of the third Century, a certain Abd-Kelal, son of Dhu-l Awad, who was King of Himyar and Yemen from 273 to 297, became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> through the teaching of a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, but, on being discovered by his people, was killed (Caussin de Perceval, Histoire des Arabes avant l'Islamisme, III, 234). Assemani, followed by Caussin de Perceval, thinks that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> first entered Najran in the time of Dhu Nuwas (sixth century). This king, he says, was so alarmed by its advance that he ordered a general massacre of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> if they refused to embrace <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, to which he and his whole dynasty belonged. He identifies Harith, or Arethas, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> prince and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of Najran, with the above-mentioned Abdallah ibn Thamir, whose tribe's name was, according to him, Harith or Arethas. This, however, is improbable, for at the time of Dhu Nuwas's accession to the throne, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was already flourishing at Najran, with its own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and churches.

<p>What was the exact condition of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in southern Arabia during the fifth and sixth centuries, we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but from the episode of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Najran it clearly appears that its spread was constant and steady. The principal and most powerful obstacle to the permanent success of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Yemen was undoubtedly the numerous communities of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> scattered in that section of the peninsula, who had acquired so great a religious, political, and monetary influence that they threatened for a while to become the dominant power. They had their own poets and orators, <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, princes and even kings. Their power was constantly used to keep in check the progress of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and they were the direct cause of the almost entire annihilation of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Najran. "Like other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities which preach toleration when oppressed, they [the Arab <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>] became <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> when they had acquired sovereignty." &mdash; Margoliouth, Mohammed and the Rise of Islam (London, 1905), 36. This <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, which occurred in 523, and in which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> piled faggots and lit fires, and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were burned, happened as follows.

<p>About the beginning of the sixth century, the Kingdom of Himyar and Yemen was subject to <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> rule. Kalib, King of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, known by the Greek historians under the name of Elesbaan, or Hellesthaios, had succeeded, after a desperate struggle, in subjugating Himyar to the throne of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>. Though not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, he was favourably inclined towards <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, as he was on friendly terms with the Romans. He is said to have vowed to become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in the event of his conquering Himyar, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> he in all probability fulfilled. Rabiah ibn Mudhar, the defeated Himyarite king, who, like all his predecessors of the same dynasty, was a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, was compelled to seek shelter in Hira, and was succeeded by a certain Yusuf Dhu Nuwas, likewise a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, but a vassal to the Negus of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>. About the year 523 (not 560, as the majority of Arab historians believe), and as soon as the victorious <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> army had retraced its steps, Dhu Nuwas revolted against Elesbaan and, instigated by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, resolved to wreak his vengeance on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. All who refused to renounce their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and embrace <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> without respect to age or sex. The town of Najran, to the north of Yemen, and the bulwark of South-Arabian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, suffered the most. Dhu Nuwas marched against the latter city and, finding it impregnable, treacherously promised the inhabitants full amnesty in the case of their surrender.

<p>On entering the city, Dhu Nuwas ordered a general massacre of all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. "Large pits were dug in the neighbourhood and filled with burning fuel, and all those who refused to <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and embrace <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, amounting to many thousands, including the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the surrounding regions, with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> virgins and the matrons who had retired to lead a monastic life, were committed to the flames. The chief men of the town, with their prince, Arethas [called by some Arabian writers Abdallah ibn Athamir], a man distinguished for his wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, were put in chains. Dhu Nuwas next sought their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Paul, and when informed that he had been some time dead, he ordered his bones to be disinterred and burnt and their ashes scattered to the wind. Arethas and his companions were conducted to the side of a small brook in the neighbourhood, where they were beheaded. Their wives, who had shown the same constancy, were afterwards dragged to a similar fate. One named Ruma, the wife of the chief, was brought with her two virgin daughters before Dhu Nuwas; their surpassing beauty is said to have moved his compassion, but their constancy and devotion provoked in a still greater degree his vengeance; the daughters were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> before the face of their mother, and Ruma, after having been compelled to taste their blood, shared their fate. When he had thus perpetrated the tragedy of Najran, Dhu Nuwas returned with his army to Sanaa." &mdash; Wright, op. cit., 54-55.

<p>From here Dhu Nuwas hastened to inform his friends and allies, Kabad, King of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and Al-Mundhir, Prince of Hira, of the event, urging them to imitate his example and exterminate their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> subjects. Dhu Nuwas's messengers arrived 20 January, 524, at Hufhuf (El-Hassa), near the Persian Gulf, where Al-Mundhir was then entertaining an embassy sent to him by the Emperor Justin and composed of Sergius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rosapha, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Abramos, and many other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, among whom was the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Simeon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Beth-Arsam, in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. Al-Mundhir received and communicated the news of the massacre to the members of the embassy, who were horrified. According to Ibn Ishaq, the number of the massacred <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was 20,000, while the letter of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Beth-Arsam said there were 427 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> virgins, and more than 4,000 <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. This <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, immediately after his return to Hira, wrote a circumstantial account of the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Najran and sent it to Simeon, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Gabula, near Chalcis. In it he asks to have the news communicated to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, to the King of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, to the Bishops of Antioch, <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, Caesarea in Cappadocia, and <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, and urges his Roman brethren to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the afflicted Najranites and to take up their cause. A certain Dhu Thaleban, who escaped the massacre, fled to the court of Constantinople and implored the emperor to advocate the cause of his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> countrymen. In the meanwhile the news of the massacre had spread all over the Roman and Persian Empires; for in that same year John the Psalmist, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the Monastery of Beth Aphtonios, wrote in Greek an elegy on the Najranite <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and their chief, Harith. Bishop Sergius of Rosapha, the head of the embassy, wrote also a very detailed account of the same events in Greek. Even in the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a> (Surah lxxxv) the event is mentioned, and is universally alluded to by all subsequent Arab, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, Jacobite, and Occidental historians and writers.

<p>The news of the massacre weighed heavily on Elesbaan, King of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, who is said to have now become a very fervent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. He determined to take revenge on Dhu Nuwas, to avenge the massacre of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Najranites, and to punish the Yemenite <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Accordingly, at the head of seventy thousand men and a powerful flotilla, he descended upon Himyar, invaded Yemen, and with relentless fury massacred thousands of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Dhu Nuwas, after a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> fight, was defeated and slain, and his whole army routed. The whole fertile land was once more a scene of bloodshed and devastation. The churches built before the days of Dhu Nuwas were again rebuilt on the sites of their ruins, and new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were appointed in the place of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. An <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> general, Esimephaeus, was appointed King of Himyar, and during his reign a certain Dhu Giadan, of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Dhu Nuwas, attempted to raise the standard of revolt, but was defeated. A few years later the Himyarites, under the leadership of Abramos, or Abraha, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a>, revolted against Esimephaeus, and in order to put down the revolution the King of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> sent an army under the command of one of his relatives, Arethas, or Aryat. The latter was slain, however, by his own soldiers who joined the party of Abramos. A second <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> army took the field, but was cut to pieces and destroyed. Abramos became King of Himyar, and from Procopius we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he, after the death of Elesbaan, made peace with the Emperor of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> and acknowledged his sovereignty.

<p>During the reign of Abramos <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in South Arabia enjoyed great peace and prosperity. "Paying tribute only to the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> crown, and at peace with all the Arab tribes, Abraha was <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> for his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and moderation by all his subjects and idolized by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for his burning <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in their religion." Large numbers of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> who were said to have been <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by a public dispute between them and St. Gregentius, the Arabian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dhafar. In this dispute the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were represented by Herban, one of their most learned rabbis, and Christ is said to have appeared in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a> sought admission to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; new schemes of benevolence were inaugurated, and the foundations were being laid for a magnificent <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Sanaa, where is said to have existed a picture of the Madonna, afterwards moved by the Quraishites and placed in the Caaba, at <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a> (Margoliouth, op. cit., 42).

<p>In short, South-Arabian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, during the reign of Abramos i.e. in the first half of the sixth century, "seemed on the eve of its Golden Age" (Zwemer, Arabia, the Cradle of Islam, 308). The king is also said to have framed, with the assistance of Bishop Gregentius, his great friend, admirer and counsellor, a code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the people of Himyar, still extant in Greek, and divided in twenty-three sections. The authenticity of this code, however, is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> by many, as it is more ascetic and monastic in character than social. The whole career, in fact, of St. Gregentius and his relations with Elesbaan, Abramos, and Herban are interwoven with legend (Duchesne, op. cit., 334-336). In 550, Abramos's glorious reign came to a disastrous end. According to Arab historians, the event took place in 570, the year of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> birth; but, as Noeldeke has shown, this is simply an ingenious arrangement in order to connect the rise of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> with the overthrow of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rule in Yemen; for the latter event must have taken place at least twenty years earlier (Tabar, I, 203). Abramos's defeat is reported by all <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> historians with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and satisfaction, and is known among them as the "Day of the Elephant." <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> himself devoted to it an entire surah of his <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>. This defeat forms the last chapter in the history of South-Arabian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the preface to the advent of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. It was brought about as follows.

<p>Towards the first half of the sixth century the temple of Caaba, in <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a>, had become, as of old, the Eleusis of Arabia. It was sought and annually visited by thousands of Arabs from all parts of the peninsula, and enriched with presents and donations of every kind and description. Its custodians were of the tribe of Quraish, to which <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> belonged, and which had then become the most powerful and illustrious one of Hijaz. Abramos, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> King of Himyar, beheld with grief the multitudes of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who went to pay their <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> devotions to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> of the Caaba, and, in order to divert the attention and worship of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Arabs to another object, he resolved to build a magnificent church at Sanaa. The edifice was completed, and far surpassed the Caaba in the splendour of its decorations. To attain his object, Abramos issued a proclamation ordering the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to relinquish their former route for the shorter and more convenient journey to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church of Sanaa. The object was attained, and the Quraish found themselves reduced to a precarious financial and politico-religious condition. To avenge themselves and to depreciate in the eyes of the Arab tribes the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church of Sanaa they hired a certain man of the Kenanah tribe to enter the church and defile it by strewing it with dung, which was enough to make the Arabs look at the place with horror and disgust. The <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> was successfully effected, and its criminal agent fled, spreading everywhere in his flight the news of the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">profanation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church. The <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> was a signal of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and vengeance, and Abramos determined to destroy the tribes of Kenanah and Quraish, and to demolish the Caaba. Accordingly at the head of a powerful army, accompanied by numerous elephants, he invaded Hijaz, defeated the hostile tribes in his way, and approached Mecca.

<p>The chief of the tribe of Quraish and the guardian of the Caaba was then the venerable Abdul-Muttalib ibn Hashim, the grandfather of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>. This chief, at the news of the approach of the Himyarite army, sought peace with Abramos, offering him as a ransom for the Caaba a third part of the wealth of Hijaz; but Abramos was inflexible. Despairing of victory and overwhelmed with terror, the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a>, led by Abdul-Muttalib, took refuge in the neighbouring mountains that overhung the narrow pass through which the enemy must advance. Approaching the city by way of the narrow valley, Abramos and his army, not knowing that the heights were occupied by the Quraishites, fell beneath the numberless masses of rock and other missiles incessantly poured upon them and their elephants by the assailants. Abramos was defeated and compelled to retreat. His army was almost annihilated, and the king himself returned a fugitive to Sanaa, where he died soon after, as much of vexation as of his wounds.

<p><a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> writers attribute the defeat of Abramos and the victory of Quraish to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> intervention, not unlike that which defeated the army of Sennacherib under the walls of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Be this as it may, by the defeat of the Himyarite army Quraish became supreme in command and authority. In the meanwhile, Yaksoum and Masrouq, sons of Abramos, had succeeded him in turn, but their power had so much declined that they had to seek alliance with the Sassanian kings of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, which caused a general revolt in southern and central Arabia. In 568, two years before <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> birth, a <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> military expedition invaded Yemen and Oman and brought the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> dynasty and that of Abramos to an end. A tributary prince was appointed over Himyar by the Sassanian kings, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Saif dhu Yezen, a descendant of the old royal race of Himyar. This prince, during the rein of Masrouq, and at the instigation of some noble and rich Himyarites who had assisted him with money and all the means available, repaired to Constantinople and appealed to Mauricius, the Byzantine emperor, for assistance in delivering Himyar from the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> yoke. Mauricius refused to help him, on the ground that the unity of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> between the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> prevented him from taking any such action. Saif, disappointed and hopeless, went to Nu'm&acirc;n ibn al Mundhir, Prince of Hira. This prince presented Saif to Khosroes Noushirwan, King of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, to whom he explained the object of his mission. Khosroes at first was unwilling to undertake so dangerous an enterprise, but afterwards, won over by the promises of Saif and the advice of his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, sent an army of 4,000 Persian soldiers, drawn from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, under the command of Wahriz and accompanied by Saif himself.

<p>The army advanced to Hadramaut, where it was joined by Saif's own adherents, 2,000 strong, and attacked Masrouq, who was defeated and slain in battle. Saif was installed king over Himyar but subject to Khosroes Noushirwan. His first act was to expel from Himyar most of the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> residents, among whom were many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Subsequently, Saif was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by some <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> members of his own court; and after his death no more native Himyarite princes were placed on the throne. He was succeeded first by Wahriz, leader of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> army, then by Zin, Binegan, Chore, Chosrau, and Badhan, the last of whom was the governor of Himyar at the time of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> conquest of Arabia. With the overthrow of the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Dynasty in the south, the increase of factional rivalries between the Byzantine and the Persian Empires in the north, and the advent of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Arabia came to an end. It must not be imagined, however, that this violent end came without heroic resistance. The famous church, built by Abramos at Sanaa, was still in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> at the time of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, who speaks of his own visit to it, and of listening to the sermons of its famous and eloquent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Quss ibn Sa'ida. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Najran successfully resisted, during the life of the Prophet, all attempts at <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamic</a> proselytism, although, under 'Omar, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> second successor (634-644), they were finally compelled to embrace <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>; many refused to do so and were expelled. These migrated to Kufa and Hira, on the Euphrates, where, towards the end of the eighth century, the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> patriarch, Timotheus I (778-820), appointed over them a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with both native and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and churches.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, in the time of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, under one form or another, must have had also some followers in Hijaz, the stronghold of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, and especially around Mecca. Slaves were not infrequently <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> captives brought in by the trading Arabs in their journeys to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Mesopotamia. An Arab poet, quoted by Wellhausen (Skizzen und Vorarbeiten, IV, 200), says: "Whence has Al-A'sha his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>? From the wine-traders of Hira of whom he bought his wine; they brought them to him." These <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> influences are clearly visible in the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>. Among the early friends and followers of the Prophet were Zaid, his adopted son, who was of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> parentage, and many others, who, like the three famous hanif (which is translated by many as "hermits," "monks," etc.), abandoned <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> for <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. One of these, Warqa, is credited by <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> writers with a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">Christian Scriptures</a>, and even with having translated some portions of them into Arabic. Father L. Sheikho, S.J., of the Catholic University of <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, has made a good collection of extracts from ante-Islamic and immediately post-Islamic Arabic poets, in which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, and practices are alluded to. (See "Al-Mashriq" in "The Orient" of 1905, also published separately.)

<p>At Medina, the Prophet is said to have received repeated embassies from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tribes. His treatment of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Arabs was distinctly more liberal and courteous than that accorded by him to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. He looked on the latter as a dangerous political menace, while he regarded the former not only as subjects, but also as friends and allies. In one of his supposed letters to the Bishop Ka'b of the tribe of Harith, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Najran, and to their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, we read: "There shall be guaranteed to you the protection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> for the possession of your churches and your worship and your <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, shall be molested. . .so long as you remain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and fulfil your <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>." To Bishop Yuhanna ibn Ruba and to the chiefs of the people of Ayla he wrote: "Peace to you. I commend you to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> besides Whom there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I would not <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against you without first writing to you. Either accept <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> or pay poll-tax. And hearken to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His Apostle and to these envoys. . . . If you turn my envoys back and are not friendly to them then I will accept no reparation from you, but I will <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against you and will take the children captive and will slay the aged. . . . If you will hearken to my envoys, then shall you be under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> protection and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> and that of his allies." &mdash; W. A. Shedd, Islam and the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> (1904), 103. To the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Arabs he held out no compromise; they had either to embrace <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> or die; but to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of his country he always showed himself generous and tolerant, although the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> tradition tells us that on his deathbed he changed his policy towards them and is said to have commanded that none but <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> should dwell in the land. In one of his controversies with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tribe of Taghlib, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> agreed that the adults should remain <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> but the children should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> (Wellhausen, op. cit.). The feelings between the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> Arabs were so friendly at the time of the Prophet that many of the latter sought refuge with the former on more than one occasion. Under 'Omar however, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> second successor, the policy of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> completely changed, as can be seen from the so-called "Constitution of 'Omar," which, though generally regarded as spurious, cannot be entirely disregarded.

<p>'Omar's policy practically put an end to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Arabia, and certainly dealt a death-blow to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> in the newly conquered West-Asiatic provinces. This extinction and dissolution was violent, but gradual in the peninsula, where many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, moved by the wonderful success of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> arms, abandoned their religion and accepted <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. Some preferred to pay the poll-tax and retain their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Others, like the Najranites, in spite of the promise of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> that they should be undisturbed, were forced to leave Arabia and settled partly in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and partly near Kufa in lower Mesopotamia (Muir, History of the Caliphate, 150; and Arnold, Preaching of Islam, 44 sqq.). The tribe of Taghlib was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and Bar-Hebraeus tells us of two of its chieftains who later suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> (Chronicon Syriacum, 112, 115). We continue to hear for a long time of Jacobite and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Arabs, one even being <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sanaa, Yemen, and Bahrein, and of the border regions [Bar-Hebraeus, Chronicon Ecclesiasticum, I, 303; III, 123, 193; and Thomas of Marga, Book of Governors (ed. Budge, 1893), II, 448 sqq.].

<p>Under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphs, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> enjoyed, with few exceptions, great freedom and respect throughout all the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan Empire</a>, as can be seen from the facts and data collected by Assemani and Bar-Hebraeus, according to which many <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and Jacobite <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> from the seventh to the eleventh centuries received diplomas, or firmans, of some sort from <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> himself, from Umar, Ali, Merwan, Al-Mansur, Harounal-Raschid, Abu Ja'far, and others. (Shedd, op. cit., 239-241; Assemani, De Catholicis Nestorianis, 41-433 sqq.; Bar-Hebraeus, Chronicon Ecclesiasticum I, 309, 317, 319, 325; II, 465, 625; III, 307, 317, 229, 433, etc.; and Thomas of Marga, op. cit., II, 123, note.)

<p>In conclusion, a few words may be said of the various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and creeds to which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Arabs of the north and of the south belonged, as well as of their practical observance of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> religion and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. We have already seen how that part of Arabia adjacent to the Syrian borders was, from the third century on, regarded as the "mother of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>." The religious and political freedom of the Arab tribes opened the door to all creeds, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Before the rise and spread of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a> was the prevailing creed of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Arabs. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> was supplanted by <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, which had then become the official creeds of the two most representative Churches of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, Mesopotamia, and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. Like the Arabian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Arabs did not, as a rule, particularly in the times immediately before and after <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, attach much importance to the practical observance of their religion. The Arabs of pre-Islamic times were <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> for their indifference to their theoretical and practical religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and observances. Every religion and practice was welcomed so long as it was compatible with Arab freedom of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and sensuality; and, as Wellhausen truly remarks, although <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thought and sentiment could have been infused among the Arabs only through the channel of poetry, it is in this that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirituality performs rather a silent part (op. cit., 203).

<p>Arabian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was a seed sown on stony ground, whose product had no power of resistance when the heat came; it perished without leaving a trace when <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> appeared. It seems strange that these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Arabs, who had <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and churches, and even <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, of their own apparently took no steps towards translating into their language any of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> books; or, if any such translation existed, it has left no trace. The same strange fact is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the case of the numerous <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Yemen (Margoliouth, op. cit., 35, and Harnack, Expansion of Christianity, II, 300). Of these Emmanuel Deutsch remarks that, "Acquainted with the Halachah and Haggada, they seemed, under the peculiar story-loving influence of their countrymen, to have cultivated the latter with all its gorgeous hues and colours" [Remains of Emmanuel Deutsch, Islam (New York), 92]. As to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, at least the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> must have had some religious books; but as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of their existence, we are forced to suppose that these books were written in a language which they learned abroad, probably in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.
