<h1>Arason J&oacute;n</h1>  

<p>The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Iceland before the introduction of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, b. 1484; d. 7 November, 1550. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of H&oacute;lar by his <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in the Metropolitan See of Nidaros (Trondhjem), in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, 1524. He was a typical <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Icelander</a> and a man of extraordinary talents, though poorly versed in Latin, and openly neglectful of the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">law of celibacy</a>. He was thoroughly devoted to the cause of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but was more of a war-chief than a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Christian III, King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, having ordered a change of religion in <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Iceland</a>, in 1538, he encountered there the opposition of &Ouml;gmundur P&aacute;lsson, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sk&aacute;lholt, as well as that of Arason. &Ouml;gmundur P&aacute;lsson, who was old and blind, was made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by Kristoffer Huitfeldt, a royal leader, and taken to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, where he died in 1542. <span class="stiki">He actually died aboard one of Huitfeld's ships while en route to Denmark.</span> His successors were <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The leadership of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> consequently devolved on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of H&oacute;lar, Arason J&oacute;n. He maintained the defensive until 1548, when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of Sk&aacute;lholt was made vacant by the death of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> Gissur Einarsson. Then he assumed the offensive, in order to rule the Diocese of Sk&aacute;lholt in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> spirit, and to have a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> there. Marteinn Einarsson had returned from <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, confirmed as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the king, to oppose him; but Arason J&oacute;n took him <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Although suspended and declared an outlaw by the king, Arason J&oacute;n felt himself encouraged by a letter from <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> to continue his efforts to extirpate <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. His energy and his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no bounds. In an attempt to capture his greatest adversary, Dadi Gudmundsson, he was himself taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and handed over to the king's bailiff, Christian Skriver. The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Marteinn Einarsson, was at once set free, and without awaiting any formal judgment the decapitation of Arason and two of his sons, Are and Bj&ouml;rn, who had been stanch allies of their father, was agreed upon.

<p>Some fishermen avenged the death of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by killing Christian Skriver and his adherents in the following year. The body of Arason was then transferred, in triumph, from Sk&aacute;lholt to H&oacute;lar. The people, as a sign of their veneration for him, elected his son J&oacute;n as his successor. But the election lacked confirmation. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, now that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> had no leader, met with no open opposition. The people, however, continued to cherish the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their fathers for a long time and looked on Arason as a national hero and a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. Five <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Skail, and three of H&oacute;lar, were descendants of his, and in later times, among the converts at a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission given in Iceland was a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> descended from the hero <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.
