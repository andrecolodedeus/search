<h1>Arcanum</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> Letter on <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a>, issued 10 February, 1880, by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. Its scope is to show that, since <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life is the germ of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and marriage is the basis of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life, the healthy condition of civil no less than of religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> depends on the inviolability of the marriage contract. The argument of the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> runs as follows: The mission of Christ was to restore man in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. That should benefit man also in the natural order; first, the individual; and then, as a consequence, human <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Having laid down this principle, the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> deals with <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a> which sanctifies the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, i.e. the unit of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The marriage contract, Divinely instituted, had from the beginning two properties: unity and indissolubility. Through human weakness and wilfulness it was corrupted in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> destroyed its unity, and <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> its indissolubility. Christ restored the original <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of human marriage, and to sanctify more thoroughly this institution He raised the marriage contract to the dignity of a sacrament. Mutual <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were secured to husband and wife; mutual <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> between <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and children were also asserted: to the former, authority to govern and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of training; to the latter, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> care and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of reverence. Christ instituted His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to continue His mission to men. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to her commission, has always asserted the unity and indissolubility of marriage, the relative <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of husband, wife, and children; she has also maintained that, the natural contract in marriage having been raised to the dignity of a sacrament, these two are henceforth one and the same thing so that there cannot be a marriage contract amongst <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> which is not a sacrament. Hence, while admitting the right of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> to regulate the civil concerns and consequences of marriage, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always claimed exclusive authority over the marriage contract and its essentials, since it is a sacrament. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> shows by the light of history that for centuries the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exercised, and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> admitted, that authority. But human weakness and wilfulness began to throw off the bridle of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> discipline in <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life; civil rulers began to disown the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> over the marriage tie; and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> sought to sustain them by establishing the principle that the marriage contract is not a sacrament at all, or at least that the natural contract and the sacrament are separable and distinct things. Hence arose the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the dissolubility of marriage and <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, superseding the unity and indissolubility of the marriage bond. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> points to the consequences of that departure in the breaking up of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life, and its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> effects on <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> at large. It points out as a consequence, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in asserting its authority over the marriage contract, has shown itself not the enemy but the best friend of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> and the guardian of civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. In conclusion, the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> commissions all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to oppose <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a>, and it warns the faithful against the dangers of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>.
