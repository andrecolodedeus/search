<h1>Archbishop</h1>  

<p>(<em>Archiepiskopos</em>, <em>archiepiscopus</em>).
<h2 id="section1">In the Catholic Church</h2>

<p>An archbishop or <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, in the present sense of the term, is a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who governs a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> strictly his own, while he presides at the same time over the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of a well-defined district composed of simple <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> but not of provinces. Hence none of these subordinate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> rule over others. These <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are called the suffragans or comprovincials. The archbishop's own <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the archdiocese. The several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the district form the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">province</a>.
<h3>Historical origin</h3>

<p>Some writers wrongly point to Sts. Timothy and Titus, the disciples of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, as to the first archbishops in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Probably they were <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> in the wider sense of the term, one for <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, the other for the island of Crete. But it remains impossible to assign the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> when archbishops, as we now use the term, were first appointed. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> are mentioned as a well-known institution in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325) in its fourth, fifth and sixth canons, and by the Council of Antioch (341) whose seventh canon is a classical passage in this matter. It reads: "The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of every province must be aware that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presiding in the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> has charge of the whole province; because all who have business come together from all quarters to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>. For this reason it is decided that he should, according to the ancient and recognized canon of our fathers, do nothing beyond what concerns their respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and the districts belonging thereto", etc. But it cannot be denied that even at, this period the term "metropolitan" was used indiscriminately for all higher ranks above the simple episcopate. It was thus applied also to <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>. The same must be said of the term "archbishop" which does not occur in the present meaning before the sixth century, although the office of archbishop or <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> in the stricter sense, indicating a hierarchical rank above the ordinary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> but below the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> and patriarch, was already substantially the same in the fifth century as it is today. A peculiar condition obtained in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, where the archiepiscopal office was not attached to a certain see, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, but where it always devolved upon the senior <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the province, whatever see he might occupy. He was called "the first or chief bishop", or also "the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the first or chief see".
<h3>Jurisdiction</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the archbishop is twofold, episcopal and archiepiscopal. The first extends to his own diocese exclusively and comprises the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and powers of the fullest government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, spiritual and temporal, except as restricted by Church law. Unless such restriction be clearly stated in law, the presumption is in favour of the episcopal authority. The contrary holds in regard to the archiepiscopal authority. It extends to the province and the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only in as far as it is explicitly stated in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Where the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is silent, the presumption is against the archbishop. Be it remembered, however, that rightfully established and approved custom obtains the force of law. Archiepiscopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, being permanently attached to the office as such, is ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, not merely delegated or vicarious. It reaches immediately the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and mediately the faithful of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. However, it has not always been the same either in regard to time or place. While the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> office was everywhere the same in character, the extent and measure of its right and power would be greatly modified by local conditions, particular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and customs, and sometimes by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> privileges. Although many of these <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> are mentioned in different places of the <a href="../cathen/04391a.htm"><em>Corpus Juris Canonici</em></a>, yet there never was a uniform law to define them all in detail. In former times the archbishop's <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was far more ample than it is at present. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> could confirm, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, and transfer the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his province, accept from them the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance and fidelity, summon them singly or collectively to his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> (even outside of a council) at his pleasure, cite the suffragans into his court in civil and criminal trials, give them leave of absence from their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and letters commendatory in their travels, allow them to dispose of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, regulate the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> calendar of the province by fixing and announcing the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, administer the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in case of vacancy, and, finally, receive appeals lodged with him from any part of his province. But this extensive power of archbishops was later on greatly restricted, specially in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, by several of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and lastly by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The charge made by the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> curtailed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of archbishops in order to increase and strengthen their own claim of universal primacy, is best refuted by the fact that the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> authority in it struggles against encroaching <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> and <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> or rival <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, found no stronger support than that given by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had also to defend the native or acquired <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> against usurping claims of their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>. That the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> did not exceed its powers is further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the fact the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> restricted <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> even more than the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had done. In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and Africa the former <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> office is today merged in the patriarchal office. The archbishops under those <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> have no province nor archiepiscopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but only hold the rank or archiepiscopal dignity. But in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, Roumania, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, and Herzegovina the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the different Oriental rites, <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, Greeks, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, still have archbishops in the proper sense, who retain a large portion of their former <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, more than those of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. Since the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of an archbishop in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> may be described as follows:



<p>(1) In regard to his suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> may compel them to assemble in provincial council every three years, and to attend faithfully to their episcopal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, in particular those of residing regularly within their own diocese, of holding <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and of maintaining <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> (where <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> candidates cannot otherwise receive an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> training). In the provincial council the archbishop is invested with all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the presiding officer, but his voice counts no more than any of his suffragans. Modern practice has it also that when the archbishop's warning is not heeded by the delinquent suffragan, he will not himself use compulsory measures, e.g. censures, but report the case to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Only civil, not criminal, cases of suffragans come within the competency of the archbishop.

<p>(2) Generally speaking, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> has no direct <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the subjects of his suffragans. But he acquires such <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in three ways, namely: by appeal, by devolution, and by the <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a>. Today archbishops cannot visit a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, unless the matter has been discussed and approved by the provincial council. Matters of episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> will devolve upon the archbishop in certain cases mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, when the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> neglects to do his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, e.g. to fill in due time vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, or to absolve from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> when the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conditions have been complied with. This proceeds on the general principle that superiors ought to remedy the neglect of their inferiors lest too great harm be done to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her faithful children. When a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> becomes vacant the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter is bound to elect a <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar-capitular</a> who will act as administrator of the vacant diocese. If such election is not made in eight days the archbishop of the province will appoint the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar-capitular</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the archbishop appoints an administrator of the vacant diocese until <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> shall further provide. If the archdiocese becomes vacant, the senior suffragan appoints the administrator. An appeal or recourse, judicial or extrajudicial, lies directly, at least in the regular course of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> procedure, from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to his archbishop, as to the next higher instance. Whenever some disputed matter is thus brought, according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, from a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> before the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> for adjudication, he acquires direct <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the case. Appeals and recourses by the archbishop's own subjects against his judicial sentences, or other ordinances given in the first instance, lie directly, when allowed by law, to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, at least in the absence of a proper <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> or patriarch. But, to expedite and facilitate matters, other ways are usually granted by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, e.g. to appeal from the archbishop to his senior suffragan, as in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; or to the nearest other <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; or to a second and special metropolitic court in the same province called Metropoliticum as in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Since the establishment of the Apostolic Delegation in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> cases from the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> (except matrimonial cases) are usually brought directly before the delegate and no longer before the archbishop.

<p>(3) Archbishops also have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of compelling, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, the superiors of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, even those who are otherwise exempt, in charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or congregations, to have the Gospel preached in such <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> according to the provisions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. It may be observed, however that, although such are by law the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of an archbishop, their exercise is now seldom called for, so that his more prominent position is rather one of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and dignity than of actual <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Still, with all this, it remains <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to distinguish the incumbent of a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> from the bearer of a mere honorary title of archbishop (who never receives the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> and is never called <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>), often granted by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> without an actual see and sometimes to ordinary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> conquest nearly all of the early <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a> in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and Africa became extinct. In more recent time some of these were restored by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, being made residential <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. But the titles of the others are conferred as a mere honorary distinction, mostly upon <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the Roman courts and coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>. Besides the powers of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, archbishops also enjoy certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> within their province. The foremost among these is the right of wearing the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. Before receiving the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the archbishop cannot exercise any metropolitic functions nor officiate in pontifical vestments within the province, unless by a special privilege from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Other honorary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> are: to have the processional cross carried immediately before him, to wear the <a href="../cathen/10624b.htm">mozetta</a> or short cape, to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the people, to precede his suffragans, and to occupy the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> throne, all this anywhere in the province. In the archiepiscopal <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> the episcopal hat is flanked by ten tassels on each side. His address is "Your (His) Grace", "Most Reverend".
<h3>Manner of appointment</h3>

<p>The vacancy of an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> is filled in the same manner as that of an ordinary <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, whether it be by an election properly so called, or by a presentation or <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>, or by direct <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> appointment. If the new archbishop be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he will receive episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; if already a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he will be solemnly installed in the new office. But it is neither the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> nor the installation which makes the archbishop. It is his appointment to an archdiocese.
<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>There are at present (1906) in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> 164 archbishops with provinces, and 37 with only their diocese but no province, and, lastly, 89 purely titular archbishops. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> there are now 14 provinces, in British America 9, in Cuba 1, in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a> 1. For a full description of the present <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> organization in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, East and West, see the article <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">HIERARCHY</a>.
<h2 id="section2">In the Eastern Orthodox Church</h2>

<p>Archbishops are as a rule only titular, without any suffragans, but with their own diocese, the same as most of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> in the East. But in the autocephalous, or independent, national churches of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, Roumania, <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia</a>, and Herzegovina the so-called archbishops or <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> exercise, in union with the autocephalous synod, the highest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of such country. Their office, therefore, resembles that of a patriarch.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> has two archbishops in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, one of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, the other of York, both of whom are invested with <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> dignity; and two archbishops in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, one of Armagh, the other of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. Their authority is similar to that of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> archbishops. In <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> the <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a> have no archbishop; but one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is chosen by the rest to act as "Primus" without <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">BISHOP</a>, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">DIOCESE</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">METROPOLITAN</a>, <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">HIERARCHY</a>, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">PRIMATE</a>).
