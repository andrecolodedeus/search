<h1>Archconfraternity</h1>  

<p>A confraternity empowered to aggregate or affiliate other confraternities of the same nature, and to impart to them its <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and privileges. The preliminary requisite, the conditions governing aggregation, the ordinary method of conducting the process, and a list of the principal archconfraternities comprehend the information <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to a proper understanding of the general subject.

<p>A preliminary requisite to gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> is the canonical erection of the confraternity to be aggregated. Canonical erection is the approval of the proper <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority which gives the organization a legal existence. Archconfraternities do not erect confraternities; they merely aggregate them. It ordinarily belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to erect confraternities. In the case, however, of many confraternities and archconfraternities the power of erection is vested in the heads of certain <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Sometimes, especially in missionary countries or under abnormal conditions, the privileges of these heads of orders are imparted to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Such extraordinary powers have been considerably restricted within recent years. The <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> may not erect confraternities unless he has been expressly delegated for the purpose by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. For the aggregation itself the following are the principal regulations to be observed under penalty of forfeiting the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. Aggregation, or affiliation, as it is also called, may be made by those only who have received from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> express powers for that purpose. They must make use of a prescribed formula. In the same church only one confraternity of the same name and purpose may be aggregated. The consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be given in writing. But in the case of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders aggregating their own confraternities in their own churches, the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> given for the erection of the house or church of the order is sufficient. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must approve, but may modify the practices and regulations of the confraternity to be aggregated, except those to which the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> have been expressly attached. Only those <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are imparted by aggregation which have been conceded with that provision. Such <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> must be enumerated in detail, as is usually done in the prescribed formula of aggregation; no tax may be imposed for aggregation, not even for diplomas, except the expenses requisite for paper and postage. For modifications of these regulations, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the various archconfraternities should be consulted.

<p>Only the general process of conducting the aggregation is given. If it pertains to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to erect the confraternity, then the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of a church or the superior of a religious house petitions him for canonical erection, giving the kind of confraternity desired, its title, its <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, the church and locality where it is to be erected, its directors, and any deviations from the ordinary rules of the confraternity in question, and asking the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for aggregation to the archconfraternity. If the erection pertains to the head of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> consent to the aggregation is required. In all cases the information just detailed must be sent to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and to the head of the order to insure the validity of the process. Formul&aelig; embodying such essential information may be obtained usually from the authorities in charge of a confraternity. Some of the more widely known the archconfraternities are those of the Holy Name, the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Precious Blood, the Holy Face, the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Holy Rosary</a>, Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Sodality of the Blessed Heart of Mary for the Conversion of Sinners, the Cord of St. Francis, <a href="../cathen/03711b.htm">Christian Doctrine</a>, <a href="../cathen/02648a.htm">Bona Mors</a>, Christian Mothers.
