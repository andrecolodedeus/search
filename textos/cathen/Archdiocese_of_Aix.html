<h1>Archdiocese of Aix</h1>  

<p>(<em>Aquae Sextiae</em>). Full title, the Archdiocese of Aix, Arles, and Embrun.

<p>Includes the districts of Aix and Arles (Department of the Bouches-du-Rh&ocirc;ne). Before the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> the Archdiocese of Aix had as its suffragans the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of Apt, Riez, <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a>, <a href="../cathen/06378a.htm">Gap</a>, and Sisteron; the Archdiocese of Embrun, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">Digne</a>, Grasse, Vence, Gland&egrave;ve, Senez, and Nice; the Archdiocese of Arles, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of Marseille, St. Paul-Trois-Ch&acirc;teaux, Toulon, and Orange. The Archbishoprics of Arles and Embrun do not exist today, and the Archbishopric of Aix has as dependents the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of Marseille, <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a>, <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">Digne</a>, <a href="../cathen/06378a.htm">Gap</a>, <a href="../cathen/01238b.htm">Ajaccio</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>. Certain traditions make <a href="../cathen/10077a.htm">St. Maximinus</a> the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aix, one of the seventy-two Disciples and the companion of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> in Provence. The Abb&eacute; Duchesne seems to have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that this <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, the object of a very ancient local cult, was not considered the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Aix, or connected with the life of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a>, except in very recent legends, devised towards the middle of the eleventh century by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of V&eacute;zelay. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Aix is Lazarus, who occupied this see about the beginning of the fifth century. It was only at the end of the eighth century that Aix became an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>; up to that time it was dependent upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles. Arles, which today is not even a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, formerly played a very important <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> role. Its first incumbent was St. Trophimus, whose episcopate <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> places about the year 250. In a letter to Pope Leo, in 450, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of Arles said that Trophimus was sent there by St. Peter. Is the apostolic origin of the episcopate of St. Trophimus authentic, or was it invented to serve the claims of the church of Arles? This is hard to decide, but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the date given by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> is much too late, as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Arles existed before the middle of the third century, and was already flourishing and esteemed in 254 when the Bishop Marcianus was tainted with the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Celebrated names first became connected with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Arles in 417 when <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> made Bishop Patrocles the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, not only of the province of Vienne, to which Arles belonged, but of the two provinces of Narbonne; and to prevent the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul from following the custom of appealing to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Zosimus made Patrocles a kind of intermediary between the episcopate of Gaul and the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Pope Boniface</a>, the successor of Zosimus, the Bishops of Narbonne and Vienne were proclaimed <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, and Arles was authorized to keep the southern province of Vienne, the second province of Narbonne, and the Maritime Alps. The church of Arles had then two great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at its head, <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a>, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09188b.htm">L&eacute;rins</a> (427-429), and St. Hilarius, disciple of <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a>, celebrated as a preacher (429-449), who, after his conflicts with the church of Vienne, had animated disputes with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a>. Pope Hilary (461-468), intending to confer certain privileges on the Bishopric of Arles, in 474 or 475, reassembled 30 <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of Gaul against the <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestination heresy</a> and increased the importance of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. With <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">St. Caesarius</a>, Arles (502-542) reached its greatest prosperity; there the Prefect of the Praetorium of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> had his seat, while St. Caesarius represented the Pope with the episcopate of Gaul and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and exercised an indefatigable activity in codifying the canon law of Merovingian Gaul. After Caesarius the superiority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Arles was merely nominal; <a href="../cathen/15447b.htm">St. Virgilius</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of L&eacute;rins, was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles in 588, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, sent to Great Britain by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>. But after the sixth century there was no longer any question of intermediation; and in the succeeding centuries the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of Arles and Vienne existed side by side, not without frequent discussion as to the limits of their territory. The creation of the special <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> at Aix and at Embrun in 794, at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1475, diminished the power of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Arles, which was suppressed in 1802. The Blessed Louis Aleman, who played an important part in the councils of the fifteenth century, was <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles from 1423 to 1450.

<p>Among other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who brought fame to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Aix, must be mentioned Sabran, who was sent to Jerusalem in 1107 by <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pascal II</a>, and rounded the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Bethlehem; Philaster, Alphonse Louis du Plessis de Richelieu (1625-29), and Michel Mazarin (1644-55), nephews of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the same name; Monsignor du Lau, killed at the Carmes' <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in 1792.

<p>The church of Arles honors the memory of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Genesius, public registrar of Arles, at the beginning of the fourth century, who was beheaded for having refused to copy the edict of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; the church of Aix honors the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Mitre. The city of Tarascon has for its patron, St. Martha, who, according to the legend, delivered the country of a monster called "Tarasque". The church of the "Saintes Maries de la Mer" in the Camargue contains three <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, which are objects of a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>; according to a tradition which is attached to the legends concerning the emigration of St. Lazarus, St. Martha, <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10077a.htm">St. Maximinus</a>, these <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> contain the bodies of the three Marys of the Gospel. The principal councils held at Arles were: that of 314, convened by order of Constantine to condemn the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>; that of 353, which defended the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> against <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>; and that of 1234, which dealt with the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian heresy</a>. A faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, established at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Aix in 1802, was suppressed in 1876. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Arles, at first dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">St. Stephen</a>, and in 1152 under the patronage of St. Trophimus, possesses a doorway and Gothic <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of the most imposing type of beauty. The cemetery of Alyscamps, celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, contained, up to the end of the thirteenth century, the remains of St. Trophimus, which were finally moved to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The ruins of Montmajour, in the suburbs of Arles, perpetuate the memory of a great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> founded in the twelfth century. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Aix is a very beautiful edifice of the twelfth century. The Archdiocese of Aix, at the close of the year 1905, had 188, 872 inhabitants, 25 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the first, 106 of the second class and 21 curacies formerly paid by the State.
