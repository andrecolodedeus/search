<h1>Archdiocese of Albi (Albia)</h1>  

<p>Comprises the Department of the Tarn. An <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> from 1678 up to the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> Albi had as suffragans the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a>, Castres, Vabres, <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, and Mende; it was not re-established until 1822, and by this new distribution it united the ancient Bishopric of Castres and had for suffragans, besides the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a> (joined with Vabres) of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/10180a.htm">Mende</a>, the Bishopric of Perpignan. A local tradition which dates from the twelfth century attributes the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to St. Clarus, of African birth, who installed his disciple Anthimus as his successor, and went to Lectoure where he was beheaded. The details of this legend have caused the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> to legitimately suspect its authenticity. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> known to history is Diogenianus (about 406). The church at Albi is rich in mementos; it was at Vieux, in the Diocese of Albi, at the end of the fifth century, that the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Gauls (<em>coetus sanctorum</em>) was founded by St. Eugene, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> exiled from Carthage, St. Longin, and St. Vindemialis, near the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Amarandus (<a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of the third century). From the sixth to the eighth centuries, two great <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of Albi gave many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Salvia <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to which belonged St. Desiderius, Bishops of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, also St. Disciola, the companion of St. Radegonda; the Ansbertina <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to which belonged St. Go&eacute;ric and St. Sigisbald, Bishops of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, and the latter's sister, St. Sigolina, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of Traclar in the Diocese of Albi. The celebrated Cardinal de Bernis, ambassador of Louis XV, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Albi from 1764 to 1794. The memory of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> who vigorously combated the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian heresy</a> is still very fresh in the Diocese of Albi; in the vicinity of Castres there is a natural grotto containing several rooms, which is called the grotto of St. Dominic; tradition asserts that it was the retreat of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01267b.htm">Council of Albi</a>, in 1254, triumphed over the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian heresy</a> by organizing the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in that region. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Lautrec is said to have been founded in the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Cecilia of Albi (1282-1512) is a typical model of a fortified church; its sculptured gallery is the largest of its kind in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The ancient <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbey of Sor&eacute;ze, founded in 757, was converted into a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in 1854 under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>. The cities of Castres and Gaillac owe their origin to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, the first of which, it is said, was founded by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and the second by Raimond I, Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, in 960. The Archdiocese of Albi, at the end of the year 1905, contained 339,369 inhabitants, 49 first-class <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 447 second-class <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 68 vicariates with salaries formerly paid by the State.
