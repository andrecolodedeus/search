<h1>Archdiocese of Baltimore</h1>  

<p>The senior see of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>, established as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> 6 April, 1789; as an archdiocese 8 April, 1808; embraces all that part of the <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">State of Maryland</a> west of the Chesapeake Bay (6,442 square miles) including also the <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">District of Columbia</a> (64 square miles), making in all 6,502 square miles. The entire population of this area is about 1,273,000. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> numbering 255,000, are principally of English, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and German descent. There are also Polish, Lithuanian, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, and Italian congregations, and six churches exclusively for black people, four in Baltimore, two in Washington. (See <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">WASHINGTON, D.C.</a>.)
<h2 id="section1">Colonial period</h2>
<h3 id="A">Politico-religious beginnings</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, the first colony in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> where <a href="../cathen/14763a.htm">religious toleration</a> was established, was planned by <a href="../cathen/03192a.htm">George Calvert</a> (first Lord Baltimore), a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> convert; founded by his son <a href="../cathen/03193a.htm">Cecilius Calvert</a> (second Lord Baltimore), and named for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> queen, Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Except for the period of Ingle's Rebellion (1645-47) its government was controlled by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the landing of the first colony under <a href="../cathen/03194b.htm">Leonard Calvert</a> (25 March, 1634) until after 1649, when the Assembly passed the famous act of <a href="../cathen/14763a.htm">religious toleration</a>. The first three Lords Baltimore, George, Cecilius, and Charles, were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The last three, Benedict Leonard, Charles, and Frederick, were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> who had been given an asylum in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> rebelled and seised the government (165868) and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were excluded from the administration of the province and restrained in the exercise of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. When Lord Baltimore again obtained control (1658), religious liberty was restored until 1692.

<p>Taking advantage of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> disturbance in the colony, William of Orange, King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, declared the Proprietary's claim forfeited, made <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> a royal province, and sent over Copley, the first royal governor (1692). The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> was then made the established church of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, every colonist being taxed for its support. In 1702, religious liberty was extended to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> except <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were forbidden (1704) to instruct their children in their religion or to send them out of the colony for such instruction (1715). Priests were forbidden to exercise their functions and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children could be taken from a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> parent. Appealed to by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Queen Anne intervened and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were permitted to perform their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of private <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> (9 December, 1704). Thus originated the manor <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and the so-called "Priests' Mass-Houses" The apostasy of Benedict Leonard Calvert (1713) was a cruel blow to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1716 an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was exacted of office-holders renouncing their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>. An act disfranchising <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> followed (1718). Charles Carroll, father of the Signer, went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1752) for the purpose of obtaining a grant of land on the Arkansas River for his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> brethren. This plan, however, failed. To exterminate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> an attempt was made to pass a bill confiscating the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (3 May, 1754, Lower House Journal in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Archives). The missionaries, having received land from the Proprietaries upon the same conditions as the other colonists, divided their time between the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and the cultivation of their mission supporting farms. The cutting off of these revenues, would therefore have been disastrous to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Fortunately this attempt did not succeed. Such were the political conditions until the time of the Revolution (Archives <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Hist. Sec. Baltimore; Johnson, Foundations of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, Baltimore, 1883; <a href="../cathen/08484c.htm">Johnston</a>, Religious Liberty in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and Rhode Island, <a href="../cathen/15077a.htm">Catholic Truth Society</a> Publications; Browne, George and <a href="../cathen/03193a.htm">Cecilius Calvert</a>, New York, 1890; Hall, The Lords of Baltimore, ibid., 1902).
<h3 id="B">The first missionaries</h3>

<p>In the first colony brought over by the Ark and the Dove (25 March, 1634) were three <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Fathers <a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">Andrew White</a> and John Althan, and a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, Thomas Gervase (White, Relatio Itineris in Marylandiam, Baltimore ed., 1874; cf. Am. Hist. Review, April 1907 p. 584; Treacy, Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, Swedesboro, N.J., 1889; Hughes, Hist. of S.J. in N. America, 1907). The following year another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> arrived. Fathers <a href="../cathen/06083b.htm">Philip Fisher (real name Thomas Copley)</a> and John Knolles landed in 1637. In 1642, the Roman <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a>, at Lord Baltimore's request, sent to <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> two <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, Fathers Gilmett and Territt. Two <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> arrived in 1673, one of whom was Father Masaeus Massey a Santa Barbara, a truly apostolic man. There were not more than six <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at any time on the missions in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. Their missions ceased with the death of Father Haddock in 1720. In 1716 two Scotch Recollects (Franciscans) came to the Eastern Shore of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. The title "Apostle of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>" belongs unquestionably to <a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">Father Andrew White, S.J.</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was boundless. During Ingle's Rebellion (1645-47) Fathers <a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">White</a> and <a href="../cathen/06083b.htm">Fisher</a> were taken in chains to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> where the former died. <a href="../cathen/06083b.htm">Father Fisher</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> in 1648, dying in 1653, leaving the Rev. Lawrence Stanley on the mission. Fourteen years after the first colony landed nearly all the natives south of what is now Washington had embraced the Faith, living in peaceful <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> intercourse with the settlers. <a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">Father White</a> said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the princess of the tribe in his wigwam on the Port Tobacco River. A <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> farther down the stream replaced the wigwam which was in turn succeeded by St. Thomas's Manor church built in 1798 by the Rev. Charles Sewell, S.J. Such was the glorious result of the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> (a U. Campbell, in U. S. Cath. Hist. Magazine, Baltimore; Calvert Papers, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Hist. Society, 1889-94; Treacy, op. cit.; The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Cabinet, St. Louie, 1843-45. The Religious Cabinet, Baltimore, 1842)



<p>In accordance with Lord Baltimore's instruction a church was built in the early days at St. Mary's, the capital of the province. William Bretton and his wife, Temperance, in 1661 deeded the ground for the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Ignatius and the cemetery at Newtown. Newtown Manor was afterwards purchased by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In 1677 a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college was opened by Father Foster, S.J., and Mr. Thomas Hothersall, a scholastic. In 1697 we finds brick <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at St. Mary's; frame <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> at St. Inigoes, Newtown, Port Tobacco, Newport; Father Hobart's <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> (Franciscan) near Newport; one on the Boarman estate, and one at Doncaster in Talbot County. During this period (1634-1700) there were about thirty-five <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in the missions of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> all of whom with two or three exceptions were English. They were men of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> and disinterestedness. The mission at <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, in Cecil County was founded by Father Mansell (1706) the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of this mission carrying the Faith into <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">Delaware</a>. St. Inigoes house was established in 1708 end later a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was added. Hickory Mission, from which Baltimore was afterwards attended, was established in 1720, and St. Joseph's Chapel, Deer Creek (the Rev. John Digges, Jr.), in 1742. We find the Rev. Benedict Neale at Priest's Ford, Harford County, in 1747. St. Ignatius's Church, Hickory, was established (1792) by the Rev. Sylvester Boarman. About 1755, 900 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Acadian refugees settled in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were forbidden to give them hospitality. Many of them lost the Faith, but some of their descendants still preserve the Faith for which their fathers suffered. An unfinished house in Baltimore (north-west corner of Calvert and Fayette Streets) was used by them as a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was established in Baltimore (1757) by Mary Ann March, but was closed on account of the violent <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>. The historic Whitemarsh mission was founded in 1760 by the Rev. John Lewis. Frederick Chapel (St. John's) was built by Father Williams, S.J.; the church was built in 1800 by the Rev. John Dubois, at that time the only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> between Baltimore and St. Louis. The present church was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1837. In 1903 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> gave up the church and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was opened at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, D.C., 1806. During the War of 1812, it was at St. Inigoes and Frederick for a few years, then returned to Georgetown was removed to Whitemarsh about 1820, and to Frederick in 1833, whence in 1903 it was finally removed to St. Andrews-on-the-Hudson, near Poughkeepsie, New York.

<p>In 1669, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population numbered 2,000; in 1708 it was 2,979 in a population of 40,000; in 1755 about 7,000. In 1766, the following missions were about 7 attended by <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>: St. Inigoes, Newtown, Port Tobacco, Whitemarsh, Deer Creek, Fredericktown, Queenstown, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Baltimore. The twenty <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> on the <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> mission at the time of their order's suppression (1773) remained at their posts. The first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> born in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> was the Rev. Robert Brooks (1663). His four brothers also became <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Conspicuous for unselfish <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> at this period was Rev. William Hunter; whilst for over forty years Father George Thorold laboured in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> (170043). The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was, in general, self-supporting. (Treacy, op. cit.; Extracts from Letters of Missionaries, Baltimore, 1877; Sheet, Life and Times of Archbishop Carroll, New York, 1888.)
<h3 id="C">The Catholic colonists</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, mostly rural, was generous to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and hospitable to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. We find many deeds and bequests for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> purposes in the early records. Enduring one hundred years of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to whom they had offered asylum, proscribed, disfranchised, offered peace and emolument in exchange for apostasy, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> generally continued faithful, and it is inspiring to read the list of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> names that survived the dark days, and that are still in evidence on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> roll of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> &#151; Brent, Lee, Fenwick, Boarman, Sewell, Lowe, Gardiner, Carroll, Neale, Jenkins, Digges, Bowling, Edelin, Matthews, Lancaster, Stonestreet, Boone, Mattingly, Brooks, Hunter, Coombes, Spalding Semmes, Dyer, Jamison, Queen, Hill, Gwynn, Wheeler, Elder, McAtee, Pye Miles, Abell, Camalier, Smith, Plowden, Freeman, Maddox, Greenwell, Floyd, Drury, Mudd, <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Hamilton</a>, Clark, Payne, Brock, Walton, Doyne, Darnall. During the American Revolution, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, with very rare exceptions, sided with the patriots; Maryland's best <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> names are to be found on the rolls of the Continental army, both as officers and privates. The most prominent and influential citizens of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> during this epoch was <a href="../cathen/03379c.htm">Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a>, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. At this time only <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, and Delaware had removed the disabilities against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The National Convention (Philadelphia, 1787) granted religious liberty to all. (McSherry, Hist. of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, Baltimore, 1882; Scharf, Hist. of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, Baltimore, 1879.)
<h2 id="section2">American period</h2>

<p>Such were the conditions in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> when the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was appointed. Speaking of this period in 1790 Bishop Carroll said "it is surprising that there remained even so much as there was of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. In general <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were regular and unoffensive in their conduct, such, I mean, as were natives of the country" &#151; but he complains bitterly of the injury to the Faith caused by those <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who came to the colony about this time (Shea, Life of Archbishop Carroll, 49). In fact the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> began to recover from this <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> only forty years after. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Americans were subject spiritually to English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> superiors (the archpriests), until 6 September, 1665, when <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> appointed Dr. John Leyburn, Vicar-Apostolic of all The British Colonies in America remained <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Dr. Leyburn and his successors, Bishops Gifford, Petre, Challoner, and <a href="../cathen/14432a.htm">Talbot</a>, until the appointment of Dr. Carroll. After the Revolution it was plain that the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> could not conveniently remain subject in spirituals to a superior in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. A meeting was called at Whitemarsh (27 June, 1783) by the Rev. John Lewis, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. This meeting was attended by the Revs. John Carroll, <a href="../cathen/01776e.htm">John Ashton</a>, Charles Sewell, Bernard Diderick, Sylvester Boarman, and Leonard Neale. It resulted in a petition asking for the appointment of the Rev. John Lewis as Superior, with quasi-episcopal faculties. At this time the French Minister to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> schemed to make the missions of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Benjamin Franklin, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> representative to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> state of affairs, at first supported this intrigue. Congress, however, informed Franklin that the project was one "without the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and power of Congress, who have no authority to permit or refuse it". The American <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> then presented a memorial to <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>. As a result the appointment of the Rev. John Carroll as Superior of the missions of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, with power to administer confirmation, was ratified (9 June, 1784). He received the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> appointing him <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> 26 November, 1784. At this time, there were, according to Dr. Carroll, 15,800 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> (of whom 3,000 were negroes); 7000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; 200 in Virginia; 1,500 in New York. In 1782 the total population of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> was 254,000. There were nineteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and five in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Dr. Carroll made his first visitation in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> in 1785, and administered confirmation. About this time he took up his residence in Baltimore where the Rev. Charles Sewell was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In 1788, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> petitioned <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> for the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Their request was granted. They were permitted to determine whether the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be merely titular, or should have a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> &#151; and to choose the place for, as well as to elect the occupant of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>.
<h3>Election of Bishop Carroll</h3>

<p>Twenty-four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> assembled at Whitemarsh. Twenty-three voted for Dr. Carroll, who was, accordingly, appointed first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Baltimore, subject to the Roman <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a>. Dr. Carroll was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Lulworth Castle, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 15 August, 1790, the consecrator being the <a href="../cathen/15539b.htm">Right Rev. Charles Walmesley</a>, Senior <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Before leaving <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Dr. Carroll arranged with the Sulpician Fathers to establish an <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> in Baltimore at their own expense. Accordingly, the superior, the Rev. Francis Nagot with three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and five seminarians arrived at Baltimore in July, 1791. The "One Mile Tavern" and four acres of land were purchased and on 18 July, St. Mary's Seminary was opened.
<h3 id="A">Progress of Catholicism</h3>

<p>The next year the Revs. J.R. David and B.J. Flaget, afterwards Bishops of Bardstown (Louisville), <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, with <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Mr. Stephen Badin</a> who was the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in Baltimore (1793), arrived. In 1787, the Rev. Joseph Mosley died leaving about 600 communicants on the Eastern Shore, where he had laboured twenty-two years. At this time there was only one other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> stationed there. The next, year the veteran John Lewis died, being the last of the original <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> missions. In 1789 <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a> was founded. A frame church was erected at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> (1789), succeeded by Christ Church (1805) under the Rev. Joseph Zucchi. In 1791 the Diocese of Baltimore included all the territory east of the Mississippi, except Florida; in this vast territory there mere churches at Baltimore, New York (1785), <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> (1788), Charleston (1785); in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> at St. Inigoes, Newtown, Newport, Port Tobacco. Rock Creek, Annapolis, Whitemarsh, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, Tuckahoe Deer Creek, Frederick, Westminster; in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>: at Philadelphia, Lancaster, Conewago, Goshenhoppen; in <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">Delaware</a>, at Coffee Run, also at Vincennes, Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Prairie du Rocher. In 1790, a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> community was established at Port Tobacco under Mother Frances Dickinson. The <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> remained there until 1831, when twenty-four sisters under Mother Angela Mudd removed to Baltimore. In 1791, the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was opened at the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> house in Baltimore. Twenty-two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> were present. At this synod the offertory collections were inaugurated. Between 1791 and 1798 seventeen French arrived, some of whom became famous in the of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> &#151; the Revs. John Dubois (1791), <a href="../cathen/06093a.htm">Benedict Flaget</a>, J.B. David, Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal (1792), William DuBourg, and John Moranville (1794), and <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">John Lef&egrave;vre Cheverus</a> (1796). Until this time the burden of the missions of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> had been borne by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. From 1700 to 1805 about ninety <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had laboured on the mission, of whom about sixty were English, sixteen Americans, and the rest German, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a>, and French. They were apostolic men who devoted their lives without earthly reward to the service of others.

<p>In 1792, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the eastern section of Baltimore, finding it inconvenient to attend the pro-cathedral, asked for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and rented a room in the third story of a house, corner of Fleet and Bond Streets, where the first Mass was said by Bishop Carroll. This congregation numbered about twelve <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The Rev. Antoine* Garnier, from St. Mary's Seminary, visited them twice weekly until 17 December, 1795, when the Rev. John Floyd took charge. The first church was erected on Apple Alley near Wilks Street. Father Floyd dying in 1797, Father Garnier was again made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> until 1803, when the Rev. Michael Coddy succeeded him. Dying within the year, his place was taken by the Rev. John Moranville, through whose <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> the cornerstone of St. Patrick's Church (Broadway and Bank Streets) was laid 10 July, 1804. It was dedicated 29 November, 1807, being then the most imposing church in the diocese. Father Moranville died in 1824, and was succeeded by the Rev. Nicholas Kearney (d. 1840), the Rev. John Dolan (d. 1870), and the Rev. John T. Gaitley (d. 1892). In 1898 the old church was replaced by the present handsome Gothic edifice. St. Patrick's School, begun by Father Moranville, preceded all public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> In Baltimore. The earliest German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation was established 17 February, 1702, assembling for the first time for Divine service in a house near Centre Market. About 1800 Father Reuter* a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in charge of the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, fomented a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> amongst them. They built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> where St. Alphonsus's now stands, called it St. John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist's</a>, and defied the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who carried the case to the courts, which decided in his favour (1805). <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Archbishop Eccleston</a> confided the church to the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> in 1840. The cornerstone of the new church was laid in 1841, the name being changed to St. Alphonsus's. This church is distinguished for two <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> whose repute for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> entitles them to special mention, the Venerable John N. Neumann (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia, 1852-60), the process of whose <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> is still pending in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Berger, Life of Right Rev. John N. Neumann, D.D. New York, 1884); and the <a href="../cathen/13681b.htm">Rev. Francis X. Seelos</a> who died in 1867, the first steps towards whose <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> were taken in 1901 (Zimmer, Life of Rev. F.X. Seelos, New York, 1887). St. Joseph's, Emmitsburg was founded in 1793, by the Rev. Matthew Ryan. The Revs. John Dubois and Simon Brute were afterwards <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of this church. The first <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> record of St. Mary's Church, Bryantown, was entered in 1793. Father David, the first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, was transferred to Georgetown in 1804. In 1794, the first church was built in Hagerstown, attended by the Rev. D. Cahill. About 1795 a log church (St. Mary's) was built at Cumberland; a brick church was substituted in 1838. It was replaced by the present church (St. Patrick's) begun in 1849 by the Rev. O. L. Obermeyer, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1883. St. Joseph's, Taneytown, was built by Mr. Brookes (1796). Its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> was the well-known Russian nobleman and convert, <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Father Demetrius A. Gallitzin</a>.

<p>It was soon seen that a coadjutor for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was desirable in case of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> death, and the Rev. Lawrence Graessel, a German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Philadelphia, was appointed to that office. This <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> dying soon after, the Rev. Leonard Neale, a native of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, was selected, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 7 December, 1800, at the Baltimore pro-cathedral. A notable event at this time was the marriage of Jerome Bonaparte, brother of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, to Miss Patterson of Baltimore, Bishop Carroll officiating (24 December, 1803).
<h3 id="B">Educational institutions</h3>

<p>As already stated <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a> was opened by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> in 1791. (Centennial Hist. of <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a>, Washington, 1891.) In 1803 the faculty of St. Mary's Seminary instituted an undenominational college course which continued until 1852, when Loyola, College was opened. During this period it numbered among its students many who afterwards became prominent; among others Robert Walsh, A.B. Roman the Latrobes, the Carrolls, the Jenkins, the Foleys, <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">S. Eccleston</a>, J. Chanche, F.E. Chatard, <a href="../cathen/15611a.htm">C.I. White</a>. S.T. Wallis, Robert McLane, C.C. Biddle, Reverdy Johnson, Oden Bowie, Leo Knott, Christopher Johnson. At one time (1839-40) it had 207 students. In the meantime an attempt was made to separate the college from the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and in 1807 Father Nagot established a, college at Pigeon Hills, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, but in 1808, the sixteen students were transferred to a new institution begun at Emmitsburg by the Rev. John Dubois, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician. Such was the beginning of Mt. St. Mary's College. It gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> one <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (McCloskey) five <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, twenty-one Bishops, and five hundred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. To carry out a design long entertained by the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, St. Charles College, <em>petit seminaire</em>, was begun and built on land donated by <a href="../cathen/03379c.htm">Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a>. The cornerstone was laid in 1831, but owing to the lack of funds the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was not opened until 1848. The Rev. O.L. Jenkins was its first president, with one instructor and four students, but at his death (1869) there were thirteen instructors, 140 students, and one hundred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> among-its alumni. Since 1853, St. Mary's Seminary has been exclusively a <em>grand seminaire</em>, with philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> courses. The memories of the devoted <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who during more than a century have composed its faculties, men of great learning and deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, are cherished with loving reverence by the numerous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> they have taught. The alumni roll of St. Mary's contains the names of one <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, 30 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 1.400 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (Centennial History of St. Mary's Seminary Baltimore, 1891). The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was re-established in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> (1805) with the Rev. Robert Molyneux as superior.

<p>In 1808, Mrs. Elisabeth Ann Seton, a convert from Episcopalianism, went from New York to Baltimore and lived with some companions next to St. Mary's Seminary. A convert, the Rev. Samuel S. Cooper, having given Mrs. Seton and her nine companions a lot at Emmitsburg, they founded there (1810) the Academy of St. Joseph. In 1812, the community was established under the rules of the Sisters of Charity and Mrs. Seton was elected mother superior. She died in 1821, leaving a flourishing community of fifty sisters (White, "Life of Eliza A. Seton", New York, 1853; Seton, "Memoir Letters and Journal of Elizabeth Seton", New York 1869; De Barbarry, "Elisabeth Seton", 2 vols., Paris, 1881; Sadlier, New York, s.d.). The community remained independent until 1850, when the sisters allied themselves with the Sisters of Charity of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, adopting the French costume. Thirty-one sisters in the Diocese of New York preferred to continue under the old rule and organized a separate body. During the Civil War (1862-63), 140 Sisters of Charity gave their services on the field and in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. The following notable institutions have been founded in the diocese from the mother house at Emmitsburg: St. Mary's Orphan Asylum (1817); Mt. Hope Retreat (1840); St. Vincent's Infant Asylum (1856); St. Joseph's House of Industry (1863); St. Agnes's Hospital (1863).
<h3 id="C">The Baltimore cathedral</h3>

<p>The acquisition of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> increased the labours of Bishop Carroll. In 1805, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> made him Administrator Apostolic of Louisiana and the Floridas. Until this time the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had officiated in St. Peter's Church, built about 1770, at the corner of Northeast and Forrest Streets. The Rev. Bernard Diderick, a <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, attended the church monthly from 1775-82. The Rev. Charles Sewell of St. Mary's County was the first resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. Persuaded by Dr. DuBourg, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and trustees decided (1806) to erect the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> on the present site. The cornerstone was laid 7 July, 1806, by Bishop Carroll. The first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was the Rev. Francis Beeston. He died (1809) before the church was finished. His successor was the Rev. Enoch Fenwick (d. 1827), to whose untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was due the completion of the church in 1821. During the building of the church the congregation had so large that the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> opened to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Mary's Seminary, then newly dedicated (1808). For half a century it continued to be the succursal church of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. On 31 May, 1821, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was dedicated by Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal. The architect who had generously given his services gratis, and faithfully watched over the erection of the edifice was Benjamin H. Latrobe, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> gentleman, and a devoted friend of Archbishop Carroll. He was engaged at the same time in building the National Capitol. The <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was a gift to Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal from his pupils in <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. The imposing portico of the building was added in 1863, under the direction of the architect, Eben Faxon. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 5 May, 1876, by Archbishop Bayley. During Cardinal Gibbons's administration a commodious <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> was erected (1879); the sanctuary was extended (1888); two altars, gifts of Mrs. Michael Jenkins and James Sloan, were added, and the <a href="../cathen/01356c.htm">altar rail</a> in memory of William Boggs donated (1906). There are few edifices in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> as rich in historical memories as the Baltimore Cathedral. Within its walls have been held three plenary council (1852, 1866, 1884), ten provincial councils, and nine <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>; three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> have been invested, Gibbons, 1886; Satolli, 1890; Martinelli, 1901; six <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> have received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, twenty-fire <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and 644 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Cardinal Gibbons alone. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> were, B.J.

In the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> built by Cardinal Gibbons under the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> repose the ashes of Carroll, Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal, Whitfield, <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Eccleston</a>, <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Kenrick</a>, and Spalding.

It is worthy of remark that although the trustee System has been continued at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> for over one hundred years, there has never been any serious disagreement between the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> residence was built during Dr. Whitfield's administration, and the two wings were added in 1865 by Captain William Kennedy.
<h3 id="D">Division of the diocese</h3>

<p>In compliance with Bishop Carroll's request for a division of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (8 April, 1808) issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> treating four new sees, naming the Rev. Richard L. Concannen, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> for New York; the Rev. Michael Egan, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> for Philadelphia; the Rev. John <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> for <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, and the Rev. Benedict Joseph Flaget, Suplician, for Bardstown. At the same time Baltimore was made the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> with Dr. Carroll as the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Dr. Concannen, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1808), died at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (1810) when about to sail. Dr. Egan and <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Dr. Cheverus</a> were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Baltimore in the pro-cathedral (1810) and Dr. Flaget at St. Patrick's the same year. The <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> was conferred on Archbishop Carroll in St. Peter's, Baltimore, 18 August, 1811. At this time there were in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> about seventy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and eighty churches. <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">District of Columbia</a>, the Carolinas, what is now Alabama, <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">Mississippi</a>, <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and Florida were still under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Baltimore, and 1811 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> added some of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> West Indies. At this period occurred the interference of Archbishop Troy and other <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in American affairs (Shea, Life and Times of Abp. Carroll, pp. 664-668). Dr. Carroll's protest at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was rendered ineffectual, owing to the representations of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers Harold, who had hastened the death of Bishop Egan of Philadelphia, and afterwards, in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, enlisted against the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> the support of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. Worn out with the struggle, he died 3 December, 1815.
<h2 id="section3">Successors of archbishop Carroll</h2>
<h3 id="A">Leonard Neale</h3>

<p>Archbishop Carroll was succeeded by Leonard Neale, a native of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> (Mother Mary de la March&eacute; end two others) had already opened an academy in 1801 at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, with Miss Alice Lalor as assistant teacher. These <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> after the death of the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>; Miss Lalor continued the academy. Archbishop Neale erected the community of teachers into a house of the Order of the Visitation 28 December, 1817. Archbishop Neale died 17 June, at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>.
<h3 id="B">Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal</h3>

<p>Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal was born in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and joined the Company of St. Sulpice. He had already refused the See of Philadelphia (1816), but finally consented to become Archbishop Neale's coadjutor. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at St. Peter's, Baltimore, 14 December, 1817, by Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a>. In his first visitation he confirmed 2,506 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. In his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which comprised <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, the Carolinas, <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, and the territory west of <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a> to the Mississippi, there were then, according to his estimate, 100,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. About 10,000 were in Baltimore, having increased to that figure from 800 in 1792. In one year there were 10,000 communions in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> alone. There were fifty-two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, principally French and American born. The Diocese of Baltimore at this time (1819) mourned the loss of Thomas Sim Lee, twice governor, and Maryland's representative in the Convention which ratified the Constitution. In 1820, two <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, aided by intriguing <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, succeeded in having Patrick Kelly secretly appointed to the <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">See of Richmond</a> and <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">John England</a> to that of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>. Thus, without the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or consent, New York, Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, and Charleston were given for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> utter strangers, bound by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, then at variance with the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The Diocese of Baltimore was thus divided into two parts, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">District of Columbia</a> on the Atlantic, and a thousand miles off Alabama and Mississippi, with Richmond and Charleston between. Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal while at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, (1821) obtained for the provincial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to recommend candidates for vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Mississippi was erected into a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariate Apostolic</a> with Dr. DuBourg as Vicar Apostolic; Alabama and Florida were attached to the Vicariate Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a> (1825). In 1822. Bishop Kelly returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal was appointed Administrator of the <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Diocese of Richmond</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> died 29 January, 1628.
<h3 id="C">James Whitfield</h3>

<p>He was succeeded by James Whitfield, an Englishman by birth. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> by Bishop Flaget took place 25 May, 1828, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. October 4, 1829, the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Baltimore was opened, and the same day the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. The Fathers of this council were Archbishop Whitfield, Bishops Flaget, the two Fenwicks (<a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> and Cincinnati), <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Rosati, and Rev. William Matthews, representing Philadelphia. (See THE PROVINCIAL COUNCILS OF BALTIMORE.) To carry out the council's decrees, a Synod, attended by thirty-five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, was held 31 October, 1831. There were at this time in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> about 80,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in a population of 407,000; in the <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">District of Columbia</a> about 7,000 in a population of 33,000. There were fifty-two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the diocese. Out of his private fortune, Archbishop Whitfield built St. James's Church, Baltimore (1833) It was first used by English-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who, finding it too small for their increasing numbers, commenced the erection of St. Vincent's Church (1841). About the same time the German congregation of St. John's (Saratoga Street) began the building of their new church, St. Alphonsus; needing in the meantime a place for worship, they were granted the use of St. James's, after the opening of St. Vincent's (of which Father Gildea was the first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> from St. Alphonsus took charge henceforth of St. James's and built there the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of their order in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Several other churches were established by the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>. In 1845, they founded St. Michael's, a small church on the corner of Pratt and Regester Streets; the present church on the corner of Lombard and Wolfe Streets was commenced in 1857. Its congregation is now one of the largest in the city. The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> also founded Holy Cross <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, the cornerstone of the church being laid in 1858. Since 1869, the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> have been in charge. The church of the Fourteen Holy Martyrs was begun (1870) by the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>; in 1874, they transferred it to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. Rev. Meinrad Jeggle, O.S.B., was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> from 1878 to 1896. The new church was commenced in 1902. St. Wenceslaus's, dedicated in 1872, formed the nucleus of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> congregations in Baltimore. The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> took charge of it in 1882. A new church and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were commenced in 1903. In 1873 they began the Sacred Heart Church (Canton).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Province of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was formally established in 1833, with Father William McSherry, a <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginian</a>, as first provincial. The Second <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> met at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, Baltimore, 20 October, 1833. Besides Archbishop Whitfield, there were present Bishops David, England, Rosati, Fenwick (<a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>), Dubois Portier, <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">F.P. Kenrick</a>, Rese, Purcell. Bishop Flaget was absent; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were represented. A <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> adapted to the wants of this country was ordered to be prepared. <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Rev. Samuel Eccleston</a> elected coadjutor, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> 14 September, 1834, by Archbishop Whitfield, who died the following October.
<h3 id="D">Samuel Eccleston</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Archbishop Eccleston</a>, a native of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, a convert and a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician, was thirty-three years old when he succeeded to the See of Baltimore. During his administration the anti <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sentiment began to lose its <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and the tide of conversions set in. In 1834 there were within the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Baltimore (Maryland, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">District of Columbia</a>) 70 churches and 69 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. There were only 327 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the whole <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The Visitation Nuns from Georgetown established a house in Baltimore (1837) with Mother Juliana Matthews as first superioress. Mother Anastasia Coombes established another Visitation <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Frederick in 1846. In 1852 another house was established (Mt. de Sales) at Catonsville, under Mother Cecilia Brooks.

<p>The Third <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> was held in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, 1837. It was attended by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and Rosati, Fenwick (<a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>), <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">F. P.

The <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> were also represented. Rev. Richard Whelan and Rev. John Chanche were recommended by this council, respectively for the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a> and Natchez, thus freeing the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> from the administration of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a> was established in the diocese (1840) and the Young <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Friends' Society in 1848. In 1842, the cornerstone of Calvert Hall was laid on the site of the pro-cathedral (Saratoga. Street). The present imposing building was opened 1891. Rock Hill Academy was purchased by the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> (1857) and Rock Hill College incorporated 1865.

<p>The Fifth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> was held in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, May, 1843. It was attended by seventeen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. At this time there were 90,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 58 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 70 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, two <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, three colleges, two academies for boys, six for girls, five <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, and ten free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The total population of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> in 1840 was 469,232. The Sixth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> met at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, 10 May, 1846. Twenty-three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were present and four <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were represented. "The Blessed Virgin Mary Conceived Without Sin" was chosen as patroness of the Province. Sisters of Notre Dame (mother-house of Eastern Province on Aisquith Street) came to Baltimore, 5 August, 1817. "Notre Dame of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>" was established 22 September, 1873. The Seventh <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> met at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, May, 1849. <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Archbishop Eccleston</a>, in pursuance of the council's decision, issued a pastoral letter reviving the custom of <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's-pence</a> and inviting <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> then in exile at <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, to attend. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Baltimore and St. Louis and twenty-three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were present; seven <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were represented. This council recommended <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, and New York as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a>, also the creation of the Sees of <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a>, <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>. The fathers petitioned for the definition of the Immaculate Conception. One of their decrees forbade <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> officiating at marriages where a minister had officiated or intended to do so. The Province of Baltimore now comprised the Dioceses of Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>, <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, and Savanna.

<p>About this time Rev. John Hickey established a precedent by refusing to testify in court concerning <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> restored through a penitent. The court sustained him. During <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Archbishop Eccleston's</a> time, besides those mentioned above, several other churches were erected. The cornerstone of St. Joseph's was laid in 1839. In 1849, it was given to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, but returned to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in 1860.

They afterwards opened Mt. St. Agnes (1867) of which Mother de Chantal Digges was first superioress; they also have charge of the City Hospital. St. Augustine's (Elkridge) was founded 1845. Its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> was Rev. B. Plot the present beautiful church is the gift of Mr. C. D. Kenney (1902). St. Charles Borromeo (Pikesville) was commenced 16 July, 1848, by <a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">Father White</a>. The present imposing Romanesque edifice was dedicated 12 March, 1899. The Immaculate Conception <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was organized in 1850 with Rev. Mark Anthony, C.M., as its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> the present church was dedicated in 1858, during the pastorate of Rev. Joseph Giustiniani, C.M. <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Archbishop Eccleston</a> died at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, 22 April, 1851, and was buried in Baltimore. At this time there were in the diocese (Maryland and <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">District of Columbia</a>) 83 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 103 priests; 6 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a>; 12 free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and 23 <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population 100,000. Rev. H. B.  Coskery was administrator until the following August, when <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Dr. Francis P. Kenrick</a>, Coadjutor-Bishop of Philadelphia, was elevated to the See of Baltimore.
<h3 id="E">Francis Patrick Kenrik</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> convoked the First Plenary Council of Baltimore, 9 May, 1852. (See PLENARY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.) to carry out the council's decrees a synod was called (June, 1853), attended by 35 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and 17 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

In 1856 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the city of Baltimore numbered 81,000, and had 13 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, while in the entire diocese (Maryland and the <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">District of Columbia</a>) there were 99 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 130 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and a population of 120,000. The <a href="../cathen/06151a.htm">Forty Hours' Devotion</a> was established in the diocese (1858). In 1858 the Ninth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> was held in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; 8 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were present and 6 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were represented. At the Council's request the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> granted to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Baltimore the precedence in councils and meetings, held by the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, even though he were not senior <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The petition of the Fathers of this Council for a perpetual <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the Saturday abstinence was granted. In 1862, the Baltimore Province comprised Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a>, <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>, <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Erie</a>, and the Vicariate Apostolic of Florida. In the Diocese of Baltimore there were 124 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 170 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 36 free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 35 <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population 150,000.

<p>A synod was convened (1863) at which the version of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> revised by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was adopted as the one to be used in the diocese. Under <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a>, the following churches were built in Baltimore: St. John's in 1853, with Rev. J. B.  McManus as first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The present church was opened in 1856. The church of <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 15 August 1856. Rev. John Early, S.J., was its first, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and founder of Loyola College on Holliday Street (1852); in 1855 the present college was opened on Calvert Street (Hist. Sketch of Loyola Baltimore, 1902). Many distinguished citizens claim it as their <a href="../cathen/01326c.htm">Alma</a> Mater. St. Bridget's Church (Canton) was dedicated 1854 and was built by Rev. James Dolan out of his private means, as were also St. Mary's, Govanstown, and the Dolan Orphans' Home. Rev. John Constance was first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Bridget's. New churches were begun in Kent County, Long Green, and Clarkesville during 1855. <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> died 6 July, 1863, and Very Rev. H.B. Coskery, a native of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, again became administrator. He had been appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a> in 1854, but had returned the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>.

<p><em>Black Catholics</em>.

<p>During his administration <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> Church for <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> was dedicated (1864). Its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> was Father Michael O'Connor. It was put in charge of the <a href="../cathen/08519b.htm">Josephites</a> (1871) from Mill Hill College, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, brought to Baltimore by <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Rev. Herbert Vaughan</a>. These missionaries came to minister to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, there being &#151; greatly to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> masters &#151; 16,000 of them in the State at the time of the emancipation. From St. Francis sprung St. Monica's, St. Peter Claver's (1889), and St. Barnabas's (1907), all churches for black people. As early as 1828 the Sulpician Father Jacques Joubert founded at Baltimore a house of Coloured Oblate Sisters of Providence. They conduct at present St. Frances's Academy and Orphanage, and in Washington St. Cyprian's Parochial School and Academy. St. Joseph's Seminary was opened in Baltimore by the <a href="../cathen/08519b.htm">Josephites</a> (1888) with three white and one black student. Epiphany Apostolic College, its preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, was opened in 1889 by Rev. Dominic Manley. 1881 St. Elizabeth's Home for black children was established in Baltimore by Mother Winifred and three English Sisters of St. Francis. Their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> on <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Avenue was opened in 1889, the house being a gift to the order from Mrs. E. Austin Jenkins.
<h3 id="F">Martin John Spalding</h3>

<p>At <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick's</a> death the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Government attempted to interfere in the selection of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, but failed (Cathedral Records, Baltimore, 100G. p. 46; Shea, Hist. of Cath. Ch. in U. S., 1844-66, New York 1889-92 p. 393), and the Rt. Rev. Martin John Spalding, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, was elected 23 May, 1864. Archbishop Spalding invited the Sisters of the Good Shepherd from <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a> (1864) to come to Baltimore, and established them in a home given by Mrs. Emily Mactavish Their work is the reformation of fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and the preservation of young girls. At this time (1864) the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> lost one of its foremost members, <a href="../cathen/14442c.htm">Roger B. Taney</a>, Chief Justice of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The Tenth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> was opened in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, 25 April 1869; 14 <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were present. The <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> met 7 October, 1866, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. It recommended the establishment of the Apostolic Vicariate of North Carolina. St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, erected on land donated by Mrs. Emily Mactavish, was opened in 1866, and placed in charge of the <a href="../cathen/15728b.htm">Xaverian Brothers</a> from <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Mt. St. Joseph's College, begun (1876) as an aid to the Xaverian Noviate has now 40 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and 150 students. St. James's Home (Baltimore) furthers the work of the Industrial School by securing positions for, and boarding, older boys. It has about 70 boarders. A somewhat unusual event took place in August, 1868, when Revs. James Gibbons and <a href="../cathen/02382a.htm">Thomas Becker</a> were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> together in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by Archbishop Spalding. Woodstock College, the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, was opened in 1869; Father Angelo Barasci was its first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. Since then many standard treatises on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> philosophy, and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> have been published by its professors, the best known being the works of Mazzella, De Augustinis, Sabetti, Maas, Piccirelii. and <a href="../cathen/13738a.htm">Sestini</a>. In 1865 John T. Stephanini and Charles Long, <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> Fathers, were appointed to St. Agnes's Church, Catonsville. The <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Joseph was completed in 1868; Father Long was elected its first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. It was destroyed by fire in 1883 and a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was built in 1886. The <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> were established in Baltimore, 6 April, 1869. Since then 3,082 old people have been cared for by them. Rev. Thomas Foley, who had been at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> for twenty-two years, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Administrator of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> in 1870. Archbishop Spalding died 7 February, 1872. During his administration the churches built in Baltimore were: St. Martin's (Fulton Avenue) cornerstone laid in 1865, Rev. John Foley, first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>; St. Mary's Star of the Sea founded in 1869, by Rev. Peter McCoy. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> came to this <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in 1875. After Archbishop Spalding's death, Very Rev. John Dougherty administered the diocese until the installation of Archbishop Bayley (October, 1872).
<h3 id="G">James Roosevelt Bayley</h3>

<p>Archbishop Bayley had been an Episcopalian minister in New York, <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and at the time of his elevation to Baltimore, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>. Philadelphia was made a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> in 1875. The Province of Baltimore was thus limited to the Sees of Baltimore, <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>, <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a>, <a href="../cathen/15646c.htm">Wilmington</a>, St. Augustine (created 1870), and the Vicariate of North Carolina. There were in the diocese in 1870, 160 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 230 priests; 18 charitable, and six <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, institutions. In one year the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> confirmed two hundred times. Of the: 6,405 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> confirmed, 817 were converts The Eighth Provincial Synod opened in Baltimore, 27 August, 1875; 93 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and representatives of 8 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities were present. St. Ann's (York Road) built by Capt. William Kennedy and his wife, was dedicated in 1874, Rev. William E. Bartlett being its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Fathers</a> established themselves in the diocese (1875) in the Monastery of St. Peter and Paul, Cumberland. In 1882, it was made the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the order; 59 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> there. Previous to this, the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a>, Rev. John N. Neumann, had built the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter and Paul on the site of Fort Cumberland (1848). In 1866, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> succeeded the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> and remained until 1815, when the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Fathers</a> took charge. When the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> left Cumberland, they established (1867) their House of studies at Ilchester (Hist. of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> at Annapolis, Ilchester, 1904). St. Catherine's Normal Institute for training <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers was established in Baltimore (1875) by <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>. They have <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> also attached to the churches of St. Patrick and St. Pius. The latter church was begun by Archbishop Bayley, its erection being made possible by a generous donation of Mr. Columbus O'Donnell. It was dedicated in 1879, with Rev. L.S. Malloy first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The Right Rev. James Gibbons, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, was made coadjutor with right of succession 20 May. 1877. Archbishop Bayley died the following October.
<h3 id="H">James Gibbons</h3>

<p>Archbishop Gibbons is the only <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Baltimore born in that city. The Third Plenary Council met in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> 9 November, 1884 &#151; being the largest council held outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> since the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The zuchetta was conferred upon Cardinal Gibbons 7 June, 1886, and the following March he was invested in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and took possession of his titular church, Santa Maria in Trastevere. The Ninth Provincial Synod was convened in Baltimore September, 1886, 115 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at tending; 8 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were represented. The <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a> was instituted in 1887, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Baltimore was named, <em>ex officio</em>, the Chancellor. The centenary of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was celebrated November, 1889. There were present Cardinals Gibbons and <a href="../cathen/14462b.htm">Taschereau</a>; <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Msgr. Satolli</a>, representative of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 8 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 75 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 18 monsignori, and 400 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> Mexico, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> were represented. On that occasion leading <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> took part in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congress (Hughes, Proceedings of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congress Detroit, 1890) and there was a procession of 30,000 men with Mr. James R. Wheeler as marshal. In 1893, the cardinal's Silver Jubilee was celebrated. Nearly every see in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was represented; there were also present representatives of the Holy Father, and of the episcopate of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and Oceania. Bishop A. A. Curtis was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> November, 1886 and Bishop P. J. Donahue in 1894. 29 April, 1906, the centenary of the laying of the cornerstone of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was celebrated. There were present the cardinal, the apostolic delegate Most Rev. Diomede Falconio, 9 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 56 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 4 <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and about 800 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>Among the late additions to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are the Mission Helpers and the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>. The Mission Helpers opened a house in Baltimore in 1890 it was canonically organized, 5 November 1906. The Sisters of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> (of Kentucky) were established in the diocese in 1892, having charge of the household interests of the Catholic University, St. Mary's Seminary, and the cardinal's residence. The churches built during Cardinal Gibbons's administration, in addition to those already mentioned are: St. Andrew's, dedicated 6 October, 1878; St. Paul's founded in 1899 (the present imposing church was erected in 1903); St. Gregory's by means of a donation of Mr. Patrick McKenna (1884); St. Stanislaus's (Polish), founded in 1880 and taken over in 1906 by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> built through the munificence of the sons and daughters of Mr. Thomas C. Jenkins, in memory of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. and dedicated 1 January, 1891; St. Lee's (Italian); begun in 1880, by Rev. J.L. Andreis. During the administration of Cardinal Gibbons 86 new churches have been erected in the diocese. At present there are 211 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and 273 of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. There are 128 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and 136 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. In Baltimore there are 44 (24 built during the administration of Cardinal Gibbons) and 18 in Washington (10 built in the same period). There are three <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, 11 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, 13 colleges and academies, 95 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 21,711 pupils, and 7 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is at present about 255,000. The increase (1906) was 10,611, of whom 800 were converts.

<p>Owing to the disinterested spirit of its <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, the Archdiocese of Baltimore, the Mother Church of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, has been subdivided until, in extent of territory, it is one of the smallest. Yet it yields to none in its spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in the generosity of its people. Whenever called upon by the voice of religion its children have responded in a manner beyond their proportionate share. In support of the Catholic University, it is surpassed by none in proportion to its population. In the gatherings of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> homes of Baltimore have welcomed the visitors to their hospitality. Probably no diocese has been so enriched by private donations for churches and institutions. The growth of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is due first to natural increase, secondly to immigration and thirdly to conversion. The large proportion of conversions must be attributed in a great measure to the personal popularity of its present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Cardinal Gibbons, and to the influence of his convert-making book, "The Faith of <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Fathers</a>".
