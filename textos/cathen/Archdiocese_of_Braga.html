<h1>Archdiocese of Braga</h1>  

<p>(Bracara Augusta, Civitas Bracarensis).

<p>Braga is situated in a flat fertile tract of land between the rivers Este and Cavado, in the province of Minho, in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The name was derived from the costume worn by the ancient native inhabitants, which reached from the waist to the knee, unlike the tunics worn by the Romans; for this reason the latter called these <em>bragas</em> (<em>bracas</em>) a barbarous costume, and those who wore them--<a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, Scythians, and the Celtic inhabitants of Gaul--barbarians. The city of Braga is very ancient as the etymology of the name implies. Some, like St. Isidore, believe it is derived from the Greek <em>Brachys</em>, short, others from <em>hrachos</em>, thorn-bush; others again, like Diodorus Siculus, say that it is of Celtic origin. In the fifth book of his "Historical Library", speaking of the Gauls he says, <em>quas bracas illi nominant</em>. Braga, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Galicia, was one of the principal cities of Lusitania (Portugal), until the <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Emperor Augustus</a>, having brought his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> to a close, made a new division of the provinces and united it to Hispania Tarraconensis, giving it the name of <a href="../cathen/02078b.htm">Augusta</a>, and making it one of the three judicial divisions into which the provinces of Galicia was divided. It was one of the first cities of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to receive the light of the Gospel. The tradition that St. Peter de Rates, a disciple of St. James, preached here, is handed down in the ancient <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of Braga (Breviarium Bracarense) and in that of <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a>; but this, as the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> tell us, is purely traditional. Paternus was certainly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> about 390.

<p>Some have denied that Braga was a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>; others have attempted without sufficient evidence, however, to claim two <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a> for Galicia before the sixth century. The real facts in the case are that after the destruction of <a href="../cathen/02018d.htm">Astorga</a> (433) by the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> Braga was elevated to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo I</a> (440-461). Balconius was then its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and Agrestius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a>, was the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. At the latter's death the right of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank was restored to the oldest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the province, who was the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Braga. From this time, until the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> invaded <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (711) he retained the supremacy over all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of the province. In 1110 <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pope Paschal II</a> restored Braga to its former <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank. When <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> separated from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Braga assumed even greater importance. It contested with Toledo the primacy over all the Spanish sees, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> decided in favour of the latter city. At present it has for suffragans the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Porto, <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, Visco, <a href="../cathen/02729b.htm">Bragan&ccedil;a-Miranda</a>, Aveiro, and Pinhel. There have been many very famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and writers in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Among its earlier <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, besides the traditional St. Peter already mentioned, the most famous is <a href="../cathen/09731b.htm">St. Martin of Braga</a> who died in 580, noted for his wisdom and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> says of him (Hist. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, V, xxxvii) that he was born in Pannonia, visited the Holy Land, and became the foremost scholar of his time. <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a> ("De Viris illustribus", c. xxxv) tells us that he "was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Dumio near Braga, came to Galicia from the East, converted the Suevic inhabitants from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, taught them <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and discipline, strengthened their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization, and founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. He also left a number of letters in which he recommended a reform of manners, a life of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and giving of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, the constant practice of all virtues and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." For his writings, see Bardenhewer, "Patrologie" (2nd ed., 1901), 579-581. Braga having been destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, and restored in 1071, a succession of illustrious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Among these were Mauricio Burdinho (1111-14), sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Emperor Henry V</a> (1118), and by him created <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> with the title of <a href="../cathen/06795b.htm">Gregory VIII</a>; Pedro Juliano, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Braga in 1274, created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> in 1276, and finally elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/08429c.htm">John XXI</a>; Blessed Bartholomew a Martyribus (1559-67), a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, who in 1566, together with Father Luis de Sotomayor, Francisco Foreiro, and others, assisted at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; the Agust&iacute;n de Castro, an Augustinian (1589-1609), who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, 28 July 1592. Alejo de Meneses, also an Augustinian, was transferred to Braga from the <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">archiepiscopal see of Goa</a>. He had been an apostle to the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> of the Malabar Coast in Farther <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and had converted them to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> with the help of missionaries of the various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Under him was held the Council of Diamper (1599), for the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the Malabar Coast. He died at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1617 in his fifty-eighth year. in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, being then President of the Council of Castile. Three other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of note were Roderico de Cunha (1627-35), historian of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>; Roderico de Moura (1704-28), who restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and Cayetano Brand&atilde;o, who was reputed a saint among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.

<p>In its early period the Diocese of Braga produced the famous writer Paulus Orosius (fi.418) also Avitus of Braga. At the beginning of the eighteenth century a contest was waged over the birthplace of Orosius, some claiming him for Braga and others for Tarragona. The Marquis of Mondejar, with all the evidence in his favour, supported the claim of Braga; Dalmas, the chronicler of <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>. Avitus of Braga, another writer of some importance, was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who went to the East to consult with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> at the same time that Orosius, who had been sent by St. Augustine, returned from consulting <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. It was through him that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Lucian of Caphar Gamala near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, made known to the West the discovery of the body of St. Stephen (December, 415). The Greek encyclical letter of Lucian was translated into Latin by Avitus and sent to Braga with another for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Balconius, his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and people, together with a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of St. Stephen. Avitus also attended the Council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> against <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> (415). There were two others of the same name, men of note, who, however, wrought incalculable harm by introducing into these provinces the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and Victorinus.

<p>In 1390 Braga was divided to make the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, and in 1540 its territory was again divided to create the <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Archdiocese of Evora</a>. There are some fine edifices in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, among them the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of the Assumption, very large and architecturally perfect; the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> palace; the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and the Institute of Charity. The sanctuary of <em>do Senhor Jesus do Monte</em> is the object of great devotion to which many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> are made every year.
