<h1>Archdiocese of Cagliari</h1>  

<p>(Calaritana)

<p>Cagliari, called by the ancient <em>Caralis</em>, is the principal city and capital of the Island of Sardinia, and an important port on the Gulf of Cagliari. It was founded by the Carthaginians, and after the War of the Mercenaries fell into the hands of the Romans, but in the fifth century A.D. was seized by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, and in the eighth, like the whole of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> became subject to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. In 1022 the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> were expelled with the help of the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, and from that time Cagliari was governed by a "Judge". In 1324 Jaime of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> captured Cagliari and with it the rest of the island, which remained under Spanish domination until 1714, when for a short time it acknowledged the authority of Emperor Charles VI; in 1717 it was placed under the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, thenceforth known as the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. According to a legend, evidently <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, the gospel was preached in Cagliari by Bonifatius, a disciple of Christ. Historians give a long list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cagliari, said to have suffered for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> during the persecutions, and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> in his second letter to Lucifer, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cagliari, speaks of his predecessors as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that St. Juvenal, during the reign of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, escaped death by flight. Quintasius, who attended the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (314), is possibly identical with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cagliari, present at the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (343). The best known of the early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is Lucifer (354-71), the champion of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and a friend of St. Athanasius. One of his contemporaries praises his unworldliness, his constancy in the Faith, and his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sacred literature. Towards the end of his life, however, he became the author of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, which persisted after his death. For this reason, considerable controversy arose in the seventeenth century as to the veneration of Lucifer. In 1615, the foundations of his church were discovered outside of the city, not far from the church of <a href="../cathen/13486b.htm">St. Saturninus</a>, and in 1633 his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were found in a marble urn, with two inscriptions. During the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, more especially Cagliari, offered a refuge to many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from North Africa, among them Sts. Eugenius and Fulgentius, who found there the freedom of worship denied them in their own country. Primasius was an important contemporary of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> mentions in his correspondence two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cagliari, Thomas and <a href="../cathen/08295a.htm">Januarius</a>. Deusdedit came twice to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the reigns of Honorius I and <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Martin I</a>. Citonatus assisted at the <a href="../cathen/04308b.htm">Second Council of Constantinople</a> (681), was accused of treason, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his innocence. The acts of that council exhibit Cagliari at this early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> as a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>. In 787, Bishop Thomas sent as representative to the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicea</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Epiphanius. In 1075, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> reproached (Epp., VIII, x) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cagliari for wearing a <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>, a fashion which had been introduced into <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> at an earlier date; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> asked the "Judge" of Cagliari to <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to abandon this custom. The same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his colleagues were blamed by <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Victor III</a> (1087) for neglect of their churches. Under this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cagliari became known as the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. Archbishop Peter restored many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, among them that of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> St. Antiochus. In 1158, the title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> and <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a> was given to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, but in 1409 it was reassumed by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cagliari, whence arose a controversy between those sees, which has not yet been settled. Other famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cagliari were: Ildefonso Lasso Sedeno (1597), commissioned by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> to reform the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>; Ambrogio Machini, General of the Macedonians, historian of Cagliari and advocate of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Lucifer. In time several other sees were united to Cagliari: Doglia (the ancient Bona Dola), incorporated with Cagliari by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>; Forum Trajani, which in the fifth century had its own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and is believed to be the present Tortoli; Fasiana (Phausania), mentioned by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>; Suello (Susaleo), which in the ninth century had its own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and was united to Cagliari by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1427). The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built by the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, but has undergone many restorations of the <a href="../cathen/02303b.htm">barocco</a> style. The <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdiocese</a> has 143,000 inhabitants, 81 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 118 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 162 secular, and 38 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and contains 7 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of men and 2 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The suffragans are <a href="../cathen/06371a.htm">Galtelli-Nuoro</a>, <a href="../cathen/07638b.htm">Iglesias</a>, Ogliastra.
