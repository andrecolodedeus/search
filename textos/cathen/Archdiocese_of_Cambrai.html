<h1>Archdiocese of Cambrai</h1>  

<p>(CAMERACENSIS.)

<p>Comprises the entire D&eacute;partement du Nord of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Prior to 1559 Cambrai was only a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, but its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was immense and included even <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> and <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. The creation of the new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Malines in 1559 and of eleven other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> was at the request of <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a> in order to facilitate the struggle against the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The change greatly restricted the limits of the Diocese of Cambrai which, when thus dismembered, was made by way of compensation an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> with <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>, <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> and Namur as suffragans. By the Concordat of 1802 Cambrai was again reduced to a simple <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, suffragan to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and included remnants of the former <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, Ypres, and <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>. In 1817 both the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the king were eager for the erection of a see at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, but Bishop Belmas (1757-1841), a former constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, vigorously opposed it. Immediately upon his death, in 1841, Cambrai once more became an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> with Arras as suffragan.

<p>For the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> and Cambrai, who resided at the former place, see <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">ARRAS</a>. On the death of St. Vedulphus (545-580) the episcopal residence was transferred from <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> to Cambrai. Among his successors were: St. Gaugericus (580-619); St. Berthoaldus (about 625); St. Aubert (d. 667); <a href="../cathen/15445a.htm">St. Vindicianus</a> (667-693), who brought King Thierri to account for the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of St. L&eacute;ger of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>; St. Hadulfus (d. 728); Alberic and Hildoard, contemporaries of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and who gave to the diocese a sacramentary and important canons; Halitgarius (817-831), an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer and apostle of the Danes; St. John (866-879); St. Rothadus (879-886); Wiboldus (965-966), author of the <em>ludus secularis</em> which furnished amusement to clerkly persons; Gerard the Great (1013-1051), formerly <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to <a href="../cathen/07227a.htm">St. Henry II</a>, Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and helpful to the latter in his negotiations with Robert the Pious, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; (Gerard also converted by persuasion the Gondulphian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who denied the Blessed Eucharist); St. Lietbertus (1057-1076), who defended Cambrai against Robert the Frisian; Blessed Odo (1105-1113), celebrated as a professor and director of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, also as a writer and founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Martin near Tournai; Burchard (1115-1131), who sent St. Norbert and the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> to Antwerp to combat the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Tanquelin's disciples concerning the Blessed Eucharist; Robert II of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> (1368-1371), <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> in 1378 under the name of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>; Jean IV T'serclaes (1378-1389), during whose episcopate John the Fearless, son of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, married Margaret of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> at Cambrai (1385); the illustrious Pierre d'Ailly (1396-1411); the celebrated <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> (1695-1715); and Cardinal Dubois (1720-1723), minister to Louis XV.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the Diocese of Cambrai was included in that part of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> which, after various vicissitudes, passed under German rule in 940, and in 941 the Emperor Otto the Great ratified all the privileges that had been accorded the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cambrai by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kings. Later, in 1007, <a href="../cathen/07227a.htm">St. Henry II</a> invested him with authority over the countship of Cambr&eacute;sis; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cambrai was thus the overlord of the twelve "peers of Cambresis". Under <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> (1678) the Bishopric of Cambrai once more became French. The councils of Leptines, at which <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> played an important role, were held in what was then the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> part of the former Diocese of Cambrai. Under the old regime the Archdiocese of Cambrai had forty-one <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, eighteen of which belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. Chief among them were the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/06537b.htm">St. G&eacute;ry</a>, founded near Cambrai about the year 600 in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. M&eacute;dard by <a href="../cathen/06537b.htm">St. G&eacute;ry</a> (580-619), <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the church of Treves, and who built a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the bank of the Senne, on the site of the future city of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>; the Abbey of Hautmont, founded in the seventh century by St. Vincent, the husband of St. Wandru, who was foundress of the chapter at Mons; the Abbey of Soignies, founded by the same St. Vincent, and having for <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> his son Landri and, in the eleventh century, St. Richard; the Abbey of Maubeuge, founded in 661 by St. Aldegonde the sister of St. Wandru and a descendant of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> and the kings of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, among whose successors as abbesses were her niece, St. Aldetrude (d. 696) and another niece, St. Amalberte (d. 705), herself the mother of two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, one of whom, St. Gudule, was a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> at Nivennes and became patroness of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and the other, St. Raynalde, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; the Abbey of Lobbes which, in the seventh and eighth centuries, had as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> St. Landelin, St. Ursmar, St. Ermin, and St. Theodulph, and in the tenth century, <a href="../cathen/07264c.htm">Heriger</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer; the Abbey of Crespin, founded in the seventh century by St. Landelin, who was succeeded by St. Adelin; the Abbey of Maroilles (seventh century), which St. Humbert I, who died in 682, was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>; the Abbey of Elnon, founded in the seventh century by <a href="../cathen/01380b.htm">St. Amandus</a> and endowed by Dagobert; the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/06547a.htm">St. Ghislain</a>, founded in the seventh century by the Athenian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <a href="../cathen/06547a.htm">St. Ghislain</a>, and having as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> <a href="../cathen/06465b.htm">St. Gerard</a> (tenth century) and <a href="../cathen/12275a.htm">St. Poppo</a> (eleventh century); the Abbey of Marchiennes, founded by St. Rictrudes (end of the seventh century); the Abbey of Liessies (eighth century) which, in the sixteenth century, had for <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> Ven. Louis de Blois (1506-1566), author of numerous spiritual writings (see <a href="../cathen/02604a.htm">BLOSIUS</a>); the Abbey of St. Sauve de Valenciennes (ninth century), founded in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the itinerant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> St. Sauve (Salvius), <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in Hainault at the end of the eighth century; and the Abbey of Cysoing, founded about 854 by St. Evrard, Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> and son-in-law of Louis the Debonair.

<p>The list of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the Diocese of Cambrai is very extensive, and their biographies, although short, take up no less than four volumes of the work by Canon Destombes. Exclusive of those <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whose history would be of interest only in connection with the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> territory formerly belonging to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, mention may be made of St. Eubertus, an itinerant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a> (third century); St. Chrysole, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, patron of Comines, and St. Piat, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, patron of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> and Seclin (end of third century); St. Pherailde, patron of Bruay near Valenciennes (eighth century); the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionaries Fursy, Caidac, Fricor, and Ultan (seventh and eighth centuries); <a href="../cathen/15658a.htm">St. Winnoc</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bergues (end of seventh century); Blessed Evermore, disciple of St. Norbert and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ratzburg in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (twelfth century); Blessed Charles le Bon, Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, son of King Canute of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and assassinated at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> in 1127; and Blessed Beatrice of Lens, a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> (thirteenth century). The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Cortyl and du B&eacute;ron, first apostles of the Pelew (Caroline) Islands, were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 1701, and Chom&eacute; (1696-1767), who was prominent in the Missions of Paraguay, and the Oratorian <a href="../cathen/06731b.htm">Gratry</a> (1805-1872), <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>, were natives of the Diocese of Cambrai. The English college of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, founded by William Allen in 1568, gave in subsequent centuries a certain number of apostles and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Since the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1875 on higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, Lille has been the seat of important <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> faculties. (See <a href="../cathen/02352a.htm">BAUNARD</a>; <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">LILLE</a>.)

<p>The principal places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: Notre-Dame de la Treille at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, a church dedicated in 1066 by Baldwin V, Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, visited by <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>, and where, on 14 June, 1254, fifty-three cripples were suddenly cured; Notre-Dame de Gr&acirc;ce at Cambrai, containing a picture ascribed to St. Luke; Notre-Dame des Dunes at Dunkerque, where the special object of interest is a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> which, in the beginning of the fifteenth century, was discovered near the castle of Dunkerque; the feast associated with this, 8 September, 1793, coincided with the raising of the siege of this city by the Duke of York; Notre-Dame des Miracles at Bourbourg, made famous by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> wrought in 1383, an account of which was given by the chronicler <a href="../cathen/06308b.htm">Froissart</a>, who was an eyewitness. A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> formerly extant here was converted by <a href="../cathen/09665a.htm">Marie Antoinette</a> into a house of noble canonesses. Until a comparatively recent date, the great religious solemnities in the diocese often gave rise to <em>ducasses</em>, sumptuous processions in which giants, huge fishes, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, and representations of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> figured prominently. Before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 was enforced there were in the diocese Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, Camillians, Brothers of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>; the last-named still remain. Numerous local congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are engaged in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and among the sick, as, for instance: the Augustinian Nuns (founded in the sixth century, mother-house at Cambrai); the <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a> of Our Lady of Flines (founded in the thirteenth century); the Daughters of the Infant Jesus (founded in 1824, mother-house at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>); the <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a> of Esquernes (founded in 1827); the Sisters of Providence, or of St. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se (mother-house at Avesnes); the Sisters of Our Lady of Treille (mother-house at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>), and the Religious of the Holy Union of the Sacred Hearts (mother-house at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>).

<p>In 1900 the religious institutions of the archdiocese included 7 foundling asylums, 260 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 4 infirmaries for sick children, 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the blind, 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for deaf-mutes, 19 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 57 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 20 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 trades' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of domestic economy, 5 reformatories, 89 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and hospices, 32 houses of religious nurses, 7 houses of retreat, 2 <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">insane asylums</a>, and 177 conferences of the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a>. The development of charitable establishments, to which should be added many institutions founded by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> employers for their workmen, may be accounted for by the immense labouring class in the Archdiocese of Cambrai. The retreats of Notre-Dame de Hautmont are well patronized by the working <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the district. Statistics for the end of 1905 (close of the Concordat period) show a population of 1,866,994 with 67 pastorates, 599 succursales, or second-class <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 157 curacies then remunerated by the State.
