<h1>Archdiocese of Chicago</h1>  

<p>(Chicagiensis).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> created 28 November, 1842; raised to the rank of an archdiocese, 10 September, 1880; comprises the <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">State of Illinois</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> north of the south line of Whiteside, Lee, De Kalb, Grundy, and Kankakee Counties, a territory of 10,379 square miles.

<p>Any historical sketch of the Archdiocese of Chicago, however brief, must commence with the name of the intrepid <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary James Marquette, who on 25 October, 1674, set out with two attendants from the station of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> on Green Bay, to found a mission on the Illinois River. This was in pursuance of a promise he and made to the Illinois whom he had met at their village of Kaskaskia when returning from his voyage down the Mississippi the year previous. On the 4th of December he reached on his journey the mouth of the Chicago River. With his two companions he pushed his way over the frozen surface of the river, following the South Branch. Having proceeded about four miles, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to halt because of sickness. Here he built a cabin, the first white habitation, it would appear, erected on the site of the city of Chicago. After Marquette, many of the French missionaries and voyageurs traversed the land now covered by that municipality. Father St. Cosme, in all probability, passed this way in 1699. <a href="../cathen/06732b.htm">Father Gravier</a> was there in the year following. In 1795 the Pottawotomies by the treaty of Greenville ceded to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> a track of land six miles square at the mouth of the Chicago River. Here, in 1804, Fort Dearborn was erected, and about this garrison settled the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pioneers. The Rev. Gabriel Richard of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> preached at the fort in 1821. In 1822 Alexander Beaubien was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> there by <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Father Badin</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> within the limits of the thirteen original <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. As far as known this is the first case of the administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to a white <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in the vicinity of Fort Dearborn. In 1833 a petition was addressed to the Right Rev. Joseph Rosati, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Louis and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Bardstown in which latter diocese the state of Illinois then lay, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the appointment of a resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The petition declared that there were about one hundred <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Chicago and was signed by thirty-eight men representing one hundred and twenty-two <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In answer to this request Bishop Rosati appointed Father John Mary Iren&aelig;us St. Cyr to take charge at Chicago, and he celebrated the first Mass in Mark Beaubien's log cabin on Lake Street, near Market, 1833. Shortly thereafter Fr. St. Cyr secured a lot near the corner of Lake and State Streets and put up a church building twenty-five by thirty-five feet, at the cost of four hundred dollars. This modest structure was dedicated in October, 1833. A little later when Bishop Brut&eacute;, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes, visited Chicago, he found there a congregation of four hundred <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The growing necessities of the missions in northern Illinois soon demanded the services of more than one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. So, at the solicitation of Bishop Rosati, Bishop Brut&eacute; sent Fathers Fischer, Shaefer. St. Palais and Dupontavice. The last named was appointed to Joliet. Father St. Cyr was recalled in 1837. He was succeeded as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the English-speaking congregation by Father O'Meara, who removed the church building erected by Father St. Cyr to Wabash Avenue and Madison Street. After the departure of Father O'Meara, Father St. Palais built on this site a new brick structure. To the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> already mentioned the names of Fathers Plunkett and Gueguen should be added as having rendered good services in the first period of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> history in Chicago.
<h2>Creation of the diocese</h2>

<p>The needs as well as possibilities of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlement about Fort Dearborn and its vicinity were recognized to be such that the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> recommended in May, 1843, the formation of the new See of Chicago. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> acted favorably upon this advice, and in 1844 appointed as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> the Rev. William Quarter of New York. He was born in Killurine, Kings Co., <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 21 January, 1806. After a classical course made in private academies, he attended <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>. He <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to America in 1822, where, soon after his arrival, he entered Mt. St. Mary's College at Emmitsburg, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 19 September, 1829, he laboured thereafter with marked success in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of New York, until summoned to the new see of the West, for which he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, by the Right Rev. John Hughes, 13 March, 1844. On his arrival in Chicago, the fifth of May following, he found there less than twenty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Of these, only two were in Chicago, and they were of the number loaned to the mission by Bishop Brut&eacute;. Hardly a month after Bishop Quarter's arrival they were recalled to Vincennes. But one church, St. Mary's was in the city limits at the time. The new building commenced by Father St, Palais was unfinished, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> moreover was encumbered with a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of nearly five thousand dollars. This, owing to their poverty, the parishioners were unable to liquidate. It is eloquent of the unselfish <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his brother that out of their private means they paid off all the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. The demand for the services of more <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was in large measure soon met. Only two years after his arrival Bishop Quarter was able to summon to a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> synod thirty-two <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>. To the credit of his administration it must be noted that he established the first <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conferences held in America.



<p>Thirty days after his arrival in Chicago, Bishop Quarter opened a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>. Two professors, Rev. Jeremiah Kinsella and Rev. B. R. McGorsk. constituted the teaching corps of this institution in the beginning, while six young men made up its student body. Not content with a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, however, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> projected a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In December, 1844, a charter was granted for the University of St. Mary's of the Lake, and on the 4th of July, 1846, the new institution, the first of its kind to appear in the city of Chicago, was ready to receive students. To provide for the religious instruction of young ladies, Bishop Quarter secured the services of five <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>. These, with <a href="../cathen/15553a.htm">Sister Mary Francis Ward</a>, arrived in Chicago from <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburgh</a>, 23 September, 1846. The work of this <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community, begun in the first days of the Chicago diocese, has kept pace with the city's development. It was due principally to Bishop Quarter that the legislature of the <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">State of Illinois</a> passed in 1845 the bill according to which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Chicago was incorporated as a "corporation sole" with power to "hold real and other <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in trust for religious purposes". Bishop Quarter died 10 April, 1848. The four years of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> were years of foresight, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and energy, fraught with lasting <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> for the Diocese of Chicago.
<h3>Second bishop</h3>

<p>The successor of Bishop Quarter was a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, James Oliver Van de Velde, born 3 April, 1795, near Tearmonde in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was obtained from a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who had escaped to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> during the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. Young Van de Velde had a marked talent for languages and, while a professor of languages while at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, hearing the apostolic Father Nerinckx appeal for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the American missions, he decided to go to the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, where he entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>. In 1827 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. After some years of missionary work in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, Father Van de Velde was made professor of rhetoric and mathematics in the Jesuit College at St. Louis. He was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of this institution in 1820, and a year later was sent to represent the Missouri province at a general congregation of the order held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Consecrated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chicago at <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> Church, St. Louis, 11 February, 1849, he was installed in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> 1 April following. At this time there were in the diocese forty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and fifty-six churches. In the city of Chicago itself there were four churches: the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Mary; St. Patrick's founded in 1846 by Rev. Walter J. Quarter; St. Peter's (German) founded by Rev. John Jung; and St. Joseph's (German), the first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of which was the Father Jung above mentioned. Bishop Van de Velde in 1849 erected, on Wabash Avenue between Jackson and Van Buren Streets, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, to shelter the little ones bereft of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> through the cholera that visited the city that year. His name is to be associated too with the General Hospital of the Lake, founded at this time by the faculty of Rush Medical College, but in which, with the permission of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> took care of the sick. Bishop Van de Velde found the climate of Chicago detrimental to his health, and tendered his resignation to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. This was at first refused; finally, however, he was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, where, after two years, he died a victim of yellow fever.
<h3>Third bishop</h3>

<p>The third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Chicago was the Right Rev. Anthony O'Regan, b. at Lavalleyroe, County Mayo, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1809. After completing his studies at <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a> he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> November, 1833, and for ten years was professor of Scripture, Hebrew, and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/08323c.htm">St. Jarlath's</a> College, <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, of which institution he later became president. He then accepted the invitation of Archbishop Kendrick to become the head of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Louis, U.S.A. It was from this post he was summoned to occupy the See of Chicago. Consecrated in St. Louis, 25 July, 1854, he was installed in St. Mary's Cathedral the third of September following. Bishop O'Regan invited the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to establish themselves in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. One of those sent in response to this call was the Reverend Arnold Damen, who arrived in Chicago, May, 1857, and though offered the pastorate of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Name, preferred instead to found a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> out upon (what then appeared) an uninhabitable prairie. Undaunted by obstacles, he persevered until a monument to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> appeared in the capacious edifice of the church of the Holy Family. But Father Damen's work was not circumscribed by the limits of a single <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. No quarter of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> but could testify to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> as a missionary. Gifted with a power of rugged eloquence, Father Damen was particularly effective as a preacher to the masses. Adjoining the Holy Family Church is Saint Ignatius' College, begun in 1869. For years it was the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institution of its kind in the city of Chicago, and its alumni are counted in large numbers not only the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the archdiocese, but among the representatives of all the higher walks of civic life. In 1857 Bishop O'Regan was relieved of a portion of his responsibility by the erection of the new <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">See of Alton</a>. However, he was anxious to resign the high office which in the beginning he had sought to escape. His administration had met with severe complaint on the part of some of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. And so, after two years and a half in the administration of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he set forth for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to resign his charge. His resignation (3 May, 1858) was accepted, and he was appointed <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05133b.htm">Dora</a> 25 June, 1858. He died in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 13 November, 1866, having never returned to America.
<h3>Fourth bishop</h3>

<p>The Right Rev. James Duggan, who has acted as administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was then appointed its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He was born at <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth</a>, County Kildare, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 22 May, 1825, and <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a>, in 1842, to St. Louis U.S.A., where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 29 May, 1847. In 1857 he was appointed auxiliary to Archbishop Kendrick, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Antigone. Two years later he was transferred to the vacant see of Chicago. From this is dated a new era in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life of Chicago. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system was organized, and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> sprang up on all sides. In 1860 the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, and in the following year the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, established foundations among the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> of the North Side. The Religious of the Sacred Heart opened the institution that has since rendered high service in the cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Bishop Duggan chose as his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> the Rev. Dennis Dunne, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Patrick's, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whose noble and generous nature endured him to all who new him. The Rev. Thaddeus Butler was made secretary and the Rev. John McMullen chancellor. It was the last named who induced the sisters of the Good Shepherd to take up their beneficent work in Chicago. St. Columbkill's, St. Bridget's, St. James, the Immaculate Conception, and St. John's <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were also organized at this time. The refinement and gentleness of Bishop Duggan, his ease and grace of manner, made him socially very popular; while his public spirit was much appreciated by the community at large. In 1862 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be present at the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09744a.htm">Japanese martyrs</a>, and he attended, in 1866, the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>. It was about this time that he gave unmistakable signs of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> aberration of which he was finally to fall victim. Acting upon the advice of friends, he went to Carlsbad, expecting to recuperate his shattered health, but the effort was in vain, and the condition of Bishop Duggan became such that he was removed, 14 April, 1869, to the asylum of the Sisters of Charity in St. Louis. There, without recovering his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> powers, he remained till his death, 27 March 1899. Bishop Duggan being incapacitated, the Rev. H.T. Halligan took charge of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.
<h3>Administrator appointed</h3>

<p>The Right Reverend Thomas Foley was appointed coadjutor and administrator of the practically vacant see, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamus</a>, 27 February, 1870. He was born in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 6 March, 1822. On the completion of his preparatory studies at <a href="../cathen/11335c.htm">St. Mary's College</a>, in his native city, and of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> attached to this college, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by <a href="../cathen/05269a.htm">Archbishop Eccleston</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 16 August, 1846. After a short period spent of the mission of Montgomery County, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and as assistant <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Patrick's Church, Washington, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He was made chancellor by Archbishop Kendrick, and attended, in the capacity of secretary and notary, the plenary council held in that city in 1852 and 1866. He was installed in the pro-Cathedral of the Holy Name, Chicago, 10 March 1870. Bishop Foley had hardly more than become acquainted with the needs of his charge when he was called upon to witness the devastation of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> by the great Chicago fire. Seven churches together with their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residences and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the Alexian Brothers' Hospital, The House of Providence, St. Xavier's Academy and Convent, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, and a select <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> conducted by the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> were swept away. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sustained the disaster with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and set himself to the work of reconstruction with commendable energy. St. Mary's Cathedral being thus destroyed, the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the Holy Name soon appeared on the site of the old church of that name. The structure is one of the impressive church edifices of Chicago. With generous assistance from other diocese and the exercise of indomitable energy on the part of its <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Chicago soon arose from the prostrate state in which it had been left by the fire. At this time many of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders began to assist in the development of the new life which seemed to have been infused into the diocese. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> welcomed to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>, the Fathers of Saint-Viateur, and the Resurrectionists. Owing to the growth attained by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Bishop Foley in 1872 recommended that a portion of it be cut off and erected into a new see, and the <a href="../cathen/11661b.htm">Diocese of Peoria</a> was created. The period of Bishop Foley's administration was for much of the Diocese of Chicago a new birth. He saw churches, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, asylums, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the work of years, wiped out in a few hours. He saw these for the most part replaced by structures more commodious. He witnessed the erection of more than twenty-five new churches, and saw in process of construction five new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and seven academies. He purchased the Soldier's Home at the foot of Thirty-fifth street for an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, and St. Mary's church, at Wabash Avenue and Eldridge Court, he bought from the <a href="../cathen/04239a.htm">Congregationalists</a>. At his death, on the 19th of February, 1879, there were about three hundred churches in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had increased from one hundred and forty-two to two hundred and six. On the occasion of his installation he declared that he had come to do <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the peace of Christ. That his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> had rendered this promised service was universally admitted. Upon his death, after a brief administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by the Rev. Dr. John McMullen, who had been the late <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Bishop Feehan of <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Nashville</a>, <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>, was promoted to the vacancy.
<h2>Created archdiocese</h2>

<p>Patrick Augustine Feehan was born at Spring Hill, Co. Tipperary, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, on 29 August, 1829. At fifteen years of age he entered Castle Knock College, going from there to Maynooth, where he was appointed to the Dunboyne establishment. In 1852, he departed for America, proceeding to St. Louis. where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 1 November, 1852. Two years later he was appointed successor to Father O'Regan in the Theological Seminary of Carondelet. He was made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Michael's church in 1858, and shortly after was transferred to the pastorate of the church of the Immaculate Conception, in both of which charges he ever showed himself the devoted and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. On the 7th of July, 1867, Father Feehan was chosen to succeed Bishop Whelen of <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Nashville</a>, <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>. This diocese had suffered severely during the Civil War. Under the quiet but energetic administration of Bishop Feehan the demoralization of religion that followed in the wake of battle passed; churches multiplied, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were reared, while the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> increased during his administration from twelve to twenty-seven. During the visitation of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by cholera and yellow fever the labours and self-sacrifices of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> were unremitting. On 10 September, 1880, Chicago was raised to the dignity of an archdiocese, and Bishop Feehan was made its first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of his installation took place in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the Holy Name in the November following. The <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> at this time comprised of eighteen counties in the northern part of Illinois and there were one hundred and ninety-four churches and two hundred and four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In 1883 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the other <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of the country to prepare the matter to be submitted to the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>. In the next year he participated in the deliberations of this council. At this synod the first irremovable rectors of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> were appointed.

<p>On 1 November, 1890, Archbishop Feehan commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, and the demonstration with which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the archdiocese celebrated this event gave touching <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and esteem they felt for their venerable <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. In 1899, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, failing in health, and pressed with the constantly multiplying cares of his charge, asked for an episcopal assistant. In answer to this request, the Rev. Alexander McGavick was chosen <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Narcopolis, 1 May, 1899. Poor health, however, directly incapacitated him, and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was again petitioned for the needed aid, and the Reverend Peter James Muldoon was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14440b.htm">Tamassus</a>, 25 July, 1901. His energy and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> were of valuable assistance to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, while upon his personal loyalty the aged <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> could ever rely. Archbishop Feehan died 12 July, 1902. His administration in Chicago saw a development of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life unprecedented in any other period of the city's history. When he was installed there were in the diocese two hundred and four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, while at his death there were five hundred and thirty-eight. At his advent there were one hundred and ninety-four churches, when he died there were two hundred and ninety-eight. The city of Chicago, when he was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, had thirty-four churches, at his passing away there were in the city one hundred and fifty churches. Some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the manner in which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was promoted under this <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> can be gathered from the list of institutions which sprang up in his time, among them: the De La Salle Institute, St. Cyril's College, St. Vincent's College, St. Viateur's College at Bourbonnais, St. Patrick's Academy, and the Loretto Academy at Joliet.
<h3>Second archbishop</h3>

<p>Bishop James Edward Quigley of <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, New York, was promoted (8 January, 1903) to the Archbishopric of Chicago, and installed 11 March following. Born at Osshawa, <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, 15 October, 1855, he attended St. Joseph's College in <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, from which he was graduated in 1872. In this year he won a competitive examination for entrance into the military academy at West Point, but relinquished military <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> to study for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. To this end he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Our Lady of the Angels at Niagara Falls. In the following year he went for a time to the <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">university of Innsbruck</a> in the Austrian Tyrol, and thence to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where, having completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course in the College of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 13 April, 1879. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Vincent's Church, Attica, New York, in 1879, leaving this mission to become <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Joseph's Cathedral in Buffalo in 1884. Two years later he became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Bridget's Church in the same city and while ministering in this <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> taking place 24 February, 1897. The administration of Bishop Quigley in Buffalo was characterized by a clear, far-reaching discernment. His public spirit, too, made him ever a controlling power in the community, and he was particularly alert to the weal of the labouring classes. His mediation in the dock strike of <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a> in 1899 and his forceful pronouncements on Socialism were especially noteworthy. In Chicago his talent for mastering details and his regard for due procedure brought a new order and system into the government of the archdiocese, while a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held 14 December, 1905, marked the introduction to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of a body of beneficent legislation. A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students was opened in 1905, and the measures of previous administrations for the spiritual care of the immense foreign-born and constantly increasing population was continued and broadened.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>Ten nationalities other than English-speaking were represented in the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in 1908.
