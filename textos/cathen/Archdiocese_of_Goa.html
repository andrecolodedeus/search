<h1>Archdiocese of Goa</h1>  

<p>(GOANENSIS.)

<p>Patriarchate of the East Indies, the chief see of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> dominions in the East; <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> to the present province of Goa, which comprises as suffragans the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>, Mylapore, and Dam&atilde;o (or Damaun) in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, Macao in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and Mozambique in East Africa. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, who resides at Panjim, or New Goa, has the honorary titles of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of the East and (from 1886) <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the East Indies. He enjoys the privilege of presiding over all national councils of the East Indies, which must originally be held at Goa (Concordat of 1886 between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, art. 2). The Patronage of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and of its suffragans belongs to the Crown of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>.
<h2>Foundation and history</h2>

<p>The history of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> conquests in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> dates from the arrival of <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a> in 1498, followed by the acquisition of Cranganore in 1500, Cochin in 1506, Goa in 1510, Chaul in 1512, Calicut in 1513, Damao in 1531, <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, Salsette, and Bassein in 1534, Diu in 1535, etc. From the year 1500, missionaries of the different orders (Franciscans, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Augustinians, etc.) flocked out with the conquerors, and began at once to build churches along the coast districts wherever the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> power made itself felt. In 1534 was created an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> suffragan to Funchal in the Madeiras, with a <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extending potentially over all past and future conquests from the Cape of Good Hope to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1557 it was made an independent <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, and its first suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> were erected at <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a>. In 1576 the suffragan <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">See of Macao</a> (China) was added; and in 1588, that of Funai in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. In 1600 another suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was erected at Angamale (transferred to Craganore in 1605) for the sake of the newly-united <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Thomas Christians</a> (<em>see under</em> <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">EASTERN CHURCHES</a>, <em>Malabar <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a></em> and <em>Uniat Church of Malabar</em>); while, in 1606 a sixth suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was established at San Thome, Mylapore, near the modern Madras. In 1612 the prelacy of Mozambique was added, and in 1690 two other sees at Peking and Nanking in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> establishing these sees the right of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> was conferred in perpetuity on the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, under the titles of foundation and endowment.

<p>The limits between the various sees of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> were defined by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> in 1616. The suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> comprised roughly the south of the peninsula and the east coast, as far as Burma inclusive, the rest of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> remaining potentially under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the archdiocese and this potential <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was the actually exercised even outside Portuguese dominions wherever the Faith was extended by Portuguese missionaries. Missionary work progressed on a large scale and with great success along the western coasts, chiefly at Chaul, <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, Salsette, <a href="../cathen/02343a.htm">Bassein</a>, Damao, and Diu; and on the eastern coasts at San Thome of Mylapore, and as far as Bengal etc. In the southern districts the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> mission in Madura was the most famous. It extended to the Kistna river, with a number of outlying stations beyond it. The mission of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>, on the Malabar Coast, was also one of the most fruitful. Several missions were also established in the interior northwards, e.g., that of <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a> and Lahore in 1570 and that of <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a> in 1624. Still, even with these efforts, the greater part even of the coast line was by no means fully worked, and many vast tracts of the interior northwards were practically untouched.

<p>The decline of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> power in the seventeenth century, followed as it was by a decline in the supply of missionaries, etc., soon put limits to the extension of missionary work; and it was sometimes with difficulty that the results actually achieved could be kept up. Consequently, about this time the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> began, through the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> to send out missionaries independently of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>--appointing <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> over several districts (The Great Mogul, 1637; Verapoly, 1657; Burma, 1722; Karnatic and Madura, after the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1773; Tibet, 1826; Bengal, <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, and Ceylon, 1834, and others later). In certain places where these <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> came into contact with the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, there arose a conflict of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. This was particularly the case in <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, which had been ceded to the British in 1661. Here the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were at first allowed to remain in charge of the churches, but in 1720, on the ground that they caused disaffection among the people against the British power, they were expelled from the island, and the Vicar of the Great Mogul, with his <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> missionaries, was invited to take their place. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in authorizing this arrangement, did not deny or abrogate the ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Goa, but merely intended to make a temporary provision till such time as the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government should allow the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to return. (See <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">ARCHDIOCESE OF BOMBAY</a>). Efforts were made from time to time on the part of the Goan party to recover their place, and this ultimately, through a division of the churches in 1794, gave rise to the existence of two rival jurisdictions in Bombay--<em>Padroado</em> and <em><a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a></em>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had for a long time been dissatisfied with the general situation, and especially with the opposition shown to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> by the Goan <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. After the revolution of 1834 in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, the expulsion or abolition of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and the severing of diplomatic relations with the Vatican came the famous <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Multa praeclare" on 24 April, 1838 provisionally withdrawing <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> from the three suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>, Cranganore, and Mylapore, and assigning their territories to the nearest <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>--at the same time implicitly, or at least by subsequent interpretation and enactments, restricting the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Archdiocese of Goa to actual Portuguese territory. This <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> was, however, rejected by the Goan party as spurious or at least surreptitious, since they contended that even the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> could not rightly legislate in this manner without the consent of the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, as was declared in the original <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of foundation, etc. The principles underlying this dispute fall outside the scope of the present article, which is concerned solely with the main historical facts. The resistance which followed, both in <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a> and in other parts of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> has uniformly been called the "Goan or Indo-Portuguese Schism" by writers outside the Padroado party; and the term <em>schism</em> occurs frequently in the pronouncements of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; but the Padroadists themselves have always resented this title on the ground that the fault lay with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> misinformed by the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, and that they were only contending for their canonical and natural <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, etc. In 1857 a concordat was entered into which gave peace for a time, but a final settlement was not arrived at till 1886, when a further concordat was drawn up, and a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> ("Humanae Salutatis Auctor", 1 Sept., 1886) issued, by which the suspended <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> and Mylapore was restored, and a third suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (that of <a href="../cathen/04610a.htm">Dam&atilde;o</a>) added &#151; all in British territory; and after subsequent adjustments the present delimitations were agreed to. At the same time the Indian <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was established, and the whole of the country divided into provinces, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and prefectures Apostolic.

<h3>Synods</h3>

<p>The first and second <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> were presided over by Dom Gaspar de Le&atilde;o Pereira in 1567 and 1575 respectively, the third, in 1585, by Dom Vicente da Fonseca, the fourth, in 1592, by Dom Matheus de Medina; the fifth, in 1606, by Dom Aleixo de Menezes. In these five councils 316 decrees were framed relating to <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> (Fonseca, p. 67). In recent times one provincial council was held (1894) by Dom Antonio S. Valente, in which seventy-nine decrees were framed. The special Synod of Diamper, held in 1599, had for its scope the reunion of the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Thomas Christians</a>, for whom the See of Angamale was established in the following year.
<h2>The city of Goa</h2>

<p>The city of Goa, originally a fortress in the hands first of the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> and then of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, was taken by Albuquerque in 1510. As soon as he became master of the place he built the first church--that of St. Catherine, who thus became the patron of the new city. This was the beginning of a vast series of churches, large and small, numbering over fifty, with <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, hospices and other institutions attached, which made Goa one of the most interesting <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> cities in the world. The civil splendour was in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>. But the situation was an unfortunate one. Lying on a low stretch of coast-land, surrounded on two sides by shallow creeks and on the other two by miasmic marshes, the place was soon found unhealthy to such a degree that, after several ravages by epidemics, it was gradually abandoned in favour of Panjim, five miles nearer the sea. The transfer of the Government in 1759 soon led to the total desertion of the old city. In consequence the civil buildings gradually fell into decay or were demolished for the sake of building materials, and, especially after the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in 1835, many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> followed suit. In place of houses thick palmgroves gradually grew up, which now, with the exception of a few open spaces, occupy the whole area. The original city extended almost two miles from east to west along the river, and comprised three low hills <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">religious edifices</a>.

<p>Most of the churches have disappeared, leaving nothing but a cross to mark their site. Others are in various stages of decay, while a few are kept in repair. The finest of those still standing are grouped about the great square: the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (built 1571), in which alone the full liturgy is kept up by a body of resident canons, and adjoining which is an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace, the Bom Jesus church (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, built c. 1586), containing the body of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> incorrupt in a rich shrine; St. Cajetan's, built about 1655, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, built on the site of a mosque 1517-21: and finally the little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Catherine, built in 1510. Farther away, on the western hill, stand the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of St. Monica (1598), still in full repair, formerly occupied by a large community of native <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> --the only <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> religious in Goa; the Augustinian church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> built in 1572, now in ruins; <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and church of <a href="../cathen/08472c.htm">St. John of God</a> (1685), now partly in ruins; the Rosary church of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, built before 1543; the viceregal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Anthony, of about the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. The last two are still in full repair. To the south are the ruins of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of St. Paul, built about 1541, and the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, built about 1612, occupied after 1707 by <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, the scene of the "Domine, satis est", built before 1542, is still in repair. The following either have entirely disappeared or their sites are marked only by ruins: the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Martin, built shortly after 1547; college and <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Bonaventure (about 1602); Nossa Senhora de Serra (1513); <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Dominic, built about 1548, rebuilt 1550, Santa Luzia at Daujim (about 1544); <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Thomas, built to receive the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Thomas brought from Mylapore in 1560; <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Alexis, built before 1600; church of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, built about the same time; <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and church of Cruz dos Milagres, built after 1619; Nossa Senhora da Luz built before 1543; new college and <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Paul (<em>alias</em> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/13100c.htm">St. Roch</a>) used as a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in 1610, church rebuilt later. From the church of Our Lady of the Mount, on the eastern hill, which is still in repair, a magnificent panorama is obtained.

<p>Besides these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and churches there were others attached to the Royal Hospital, the Santa Casa de Misericordia, the retreats of N.S. de Serra and Santa Maria Magdalene, the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. Lazarus, the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of All Saints, etc. to say nothing of a long list of <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in the suburbs.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, which was introduced into Goa in 1500, possessed a majestic building in the great square close to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The staff (Dominicans) consisted originally of three principal officials. In 1565 there were five, whose joint salaries amounted only to about $355 per annum. In 1682 their number was raised to thirty-two, in 1800 it had increased to forty-seven. This institution, which had been once disbanded in 1774 and restored again in 1779, was finally abolished in 1812. The decaying building was pulled down in 1820, and at present only the site is preserved.

<p>From a government list drawn up in 1804, we learn the number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and regulars existing under the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> at that time. There were 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Observantine Fransciscans, with 63 inmates; 7 of Reformed Fransciscans, with 72 inmates; 10 of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, with 61 inmates; 9 of Augustinians, with 79 inmates; 1 of <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, with 28 inmates; 1 of <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, with 13 inmates, 4 of <a href="../cathen/08472c.htm">St. John of God</a>, with 30 inmates; 2 of <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>, with 61 inmates, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Monica, with 61 inmates; total, 38 houses, with 486 inmates. Collectively their funds at this time amounted to a capital of &#163;96,378 (about $491,000), with a resultant income of &#163;5876 (about $29,000) per year (Fonseca, p. 69). On the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in 1835, their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, with an aggregate value of &#163;122,566 (about $610,000), was appropriated by the government, while the number of religious expelled was 248. Their missions were transferred to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, who received some portion of the confiscated funds for their support. According to the budget of 1873-74 the state contribution to the maintenance of 110 missionaries was &#163;2145, while the total <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> expenditure for the same year was &#163;4955. (Fonseca, p. 70). These figures include the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In 1908 the total government expenditure amounted, it is said, to over &#163;16,000.
<h2>Present condition of the archdiocese</h2>

<p>In accordance with the concordat of 1886 (with subsequent adjustments) the Archdiocese of Goa comprises the whole of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> territory of Goa, and in British territory the three districts of North Canara, Savantwadi, and Belgaum, besides one exempted church in <a href="../cathen/12235b.htm">Poona</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Goa is <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> over 3 province comprising the three suffragan Sees of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>, Mylapore, and Damao in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, Macao in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and Mozambique in East Africa. The <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> territories consist of the Velhas Conquistas (llhas, Bardes, Salsette) and the Novas Conquistas. North Canara is under a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and Belgaum, <a href="../cathen/12235b.htm">Poona</a>, and the native State of Savantwadi etc., are under another called the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the Ghauts. The patriarchal residence is at Panjim, or New Goa. There is an episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Rachol containing at present about 534 students, of whom 82 are in the course of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. There is also a smaller <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Mapuca. The total member of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> belonging to the archdiocese is about 724, of whom four (at Belgaum) belong to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a>, the rest being <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. Besides these there are 20 religious of the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of St. Francis, who conduct a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for girls and an asylum at Panjim, and 10 Sisters of Charity of <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a> who have under them a asylum and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> at Belgaum. There are several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> affiliated to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Mapuca and also 145 elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The total <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population in Portuguese territory is reckoned at 293,628 out of a total population 365,291. In British territory the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is more scanty, numbering about 35,403. According to Madras Directory for 1908 the totals for the archdiocese are as follows: 102 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 22 missions, 129 churches and 336 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 619 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 312 confraternities, and 306 pious associations; 3879 children attending <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and a total <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 335,031.

<p>The map of Goa, representing an area of about a mile and a half by one mile, which accompanies this article is based on those of Cottineau de Kloguen and Fonseca, modified by personal observations made in 1907. It claims to be a rough sketch only. The crosses represent objects of which no notable features remain.
