<h1>Archdiocese of Gran</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/07560a.htm">Hungarian</a> ESZTERGOM; <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> STRIGONIUM, STRIGONIENSIS)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. From the earliest time of its existence (eighth century) up to the beginning of the eleventh century, the Diocese of Gran embraced the greater part of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, but as early as the beginning of the twelfth century its extent was considerably diminished by the founding of the Archdiocese of B&aacute;cs. Gran, however, always remained the most important, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Gran was looked upon as the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Gran extended originally over the whole of Upper <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> to the territory of the Cumans beyond the Theiss. In 1766 two more <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were established in this territory, Neusohl (Besztercze-B&aacute;nya) and Rosenau (Rozsny&oacute;), and in 1804 the Diocese of Erlau was separated from the Archdiocese of Gran, and raised to the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> rank, with the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/13192b.htm">Rosenau</a>, <a href="../cathen/15761b.htm">Szepes</a>, Kaschau (Kassa), and <a href="../cathen/14419b.htm">Szatm&aacute;r</a>. In 1776 the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Greek Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/05484c.htm">Eperies</a>, <a href="../cathen/10634a.htm">Munk&aacute;cs</a>, and Kreuz (K&ouml;r&ouml;s) were placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Archdiocese of Gran; but in 1852 Kreuz was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Archdiocese of Agram</a>, to which it had formerly belonged. The Archdiocese of Gran extends today over fourteen counties, and has as suffragans Neutra (Nyitra), <a href="../cathen/15392a.htm">Veszpr&eacute;m</a>, Waitzen (V&aacute;cz), Steinamanger (Szombathely), Stuhlweissenburg (Sz&eacute;kes-Feh&eacute;rv&aacute;r), Raab (Gy&ouml;r), F&uuml;nfkirchen (P&eacute;cs), and Neusohl (Besztercze-B&aacute;nya) (<a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>), also the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Greek Ruthenian</a> Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/05484c.htm">Eperies</a> and <a href="../cathen/10634a.htm">Munk&aacute;cs</a>. There are three chapters, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter at Gran with 22 members, the collegiate chapter of Presburg with 13 members, and the chapter at Tyrnau (Nagy-Szombat) with 6 members. The archdiocese is divided into three vicariates, Gran, Tyrnau, and Budapest; 8 archdeaneries, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> deanery of Gran and those of Bars, Hont, Komorn (Kom&aacute;rom), Neograd (N&oacute;gr&aacute;d), Neutra (Nyitra), Presburg (Pozsony), and Sassin (Sasv&aacute;r); and 46 deaneries, of which 21 belong to the Vicariate of Gran, one to that of Budapest, and 24 to that of Tyrnau. There are also in the archdiocese 13 <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and 24 exempt <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. At one time the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> numbered over a thousand, and as late as the middle of the sixteenth century exceeded nine hundred. On account of the continued advance of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and the spread of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, this number rapidly decreased, so that it was reduced to one hundred at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Under the great Peter P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> opponent of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, conditions were improved, and after his death there were 185 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Today the number is given as 480, and the total number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the archdiocese 923, of whom 729 are occupied with the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>. There are 5 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for the training of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the central <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Budapest, that of Gran, the Pazmaneum at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> at Presburg and Tyrnau. There is also an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> gymnasium connected with the Tyrnau <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The students number about 262. There are in the archdiocese 134 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, whose members number collectively 2487. In the three vicariates of the archdiocese (1909) there are 1,480,531 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and 1,057,282 members of other creeds.

<p>The already existing See of Gran was raised to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank by St. Stephen (c. 1000-38), first King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, who converted the country to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and organized the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there. He chose for the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> Gran, at that time the richest and most important city in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and the royal residence. <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, was chosen patron of the archdiocese. It was Adalbert who converted the royal family to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and evangelized the country. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church of Gran is dedicated to him, the titular patron being the Blessed Virgin. The first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun by St. Stephen in 998. The foundation stone of the present building was laid by Alexander von Rudnay (<a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> 1819-31), and it was finished under Johann Simor (1866-92). In 1198 the royal palace at Gran was given to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> for his residence. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was Astericus Anastasius (Astrik-Anastaz) (990-c. 1036), who was the most loyal co-operator of King Stephen in organizing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and who was sent by Stephen to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to beg <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> approval for the organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and to ask for the crown. It was also Astericus who, in the year 1000, <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Stephen as first King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> with the crown sent by Pope Sylvester II.

<p>On account of the part played by its <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, the history of the Archdiocese of Gran is closely connected with that of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Up to the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> resided at Gran, but when the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> overran <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> after the battle of Moh&aacute;cs, in which the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, Ladislaus Sz&aacute;lk&aacute;n (1524-26), was slain, Paul V&aacute;rdai (1527-49) removed the seat to Presburg, and when Gran also fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, to Tyrnau, which remained the seat of the archdiocese until 1820. This period is one of the saddest epochs in the history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Ecclesiastical discipline became relaxed, and notwithstanding the efforts of Nikolaus Ol&aacute;h (1553-68), <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> gained more and more territory. After the death of Anton Veranotius (1569-73), the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for twenty-three years. It was the greatest of all the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Gran, Peter P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny (1616-37), who stemmed the decline of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in Gran. He succeeded in reconciling with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> many influential <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and thus brought about the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reorganization of the country. A <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator of distinction, he earned imperishable fame by his cultivation of the Hungarian language and won a lasting place in the history of Hungarian literature. For the advancement of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion and the promotion of learning, he founded at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> the Pazmaneum, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the training of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The University of Tyrnau was also founded by him, but was transferred to Budat (Ofen) by <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>. In 1891 Klaudius Vaszary was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>.

<p>In virtue of his dignity as <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Gran possesses a number of extraordinary privileges. Johann von Kanizsai (1387-1418) was the first to be mentioned as <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, though the primacy was connected with the Archdiocese of Gran as early as 1279. The <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> is entitled to hold <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synods</a>, is Legatus Natus of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>, has therefore the right, inside of his legation, to have the cross carried before him, and deals directly with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. As <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> he has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to visit the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, with the exception of the exempt Archabbey of Pannonhalma (S. Martinus in Monte Pannoni&aelig;). Since 1715 the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> has also been a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, having the title of Prince Primate. He is the chief and privy chancellor of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and therefore keeper of the great seal of the kingdom. Formerly he was also a member of the supreme court, and in still earlier times, governor, viceroy, and First Count (<em>Erbobergespan</em>) of the County of Gran. To the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> also belonged the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to superintend the royal mint, and for this he received a certain sum out of its revenues (<em>jus piseti</em>). According to an ancient custom, he has the right of crowning the king and of anointing the queen. By a gift of <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> he was at one time able to confer nobility (Pr&auml;dialadel). The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> before a court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> through his deputy, and not personally, was another privilege of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> is also chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and chancellor of the Order of St. Stephen, established in 1764. As first banneret (<em>baro regni</em>) of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, he is a member of the Upper House.
