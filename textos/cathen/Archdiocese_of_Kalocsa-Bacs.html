<h1>Archdiocese of Kalocsa-Bacs</h1>  

<p>(Colocensis et Bachiensis.)

<p>This archdiocese embraces within its territories an archdiocese and a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/14287a.htm">St. Stephen of Hungary</a> in 1010. The question of the foundation of, and of the relations between, Kalocsa and Bacs was for a long time uncertain. George Fej&eacute;r was of opinion that St. Stephen founded Kalocsa and Bacs as independent sees, and that subsequently St. Ladislau raised Bacs to <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> rank in 1093, and united it with Kalocsa. Stephen Katona, on the other hand, held that the Archbishopric of Bacs was founded by <a href="../cathen/08737a.htm">St. Ladislaus</a> in 1903 by division of the Archbishopric of Kalocsa, the two <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> being afterwards reunited in 1135. To Julius V&aacute;rosy we are indebted for the solution of the question: he shows that the Archdiocese of Bacs never existed as an independent <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Kalocsa for various reasons changed their residence from time to time to Bacs, so that eventually there arose in this town an independent chapter with its own <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, etc. In 1135 the union of Kalocsa and Bacs was canonically confirmed, the chapter at Bacs was raised to <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> rank, and it was decided that in future the election of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> should rest with the united chapters, but should be held in some third locality. It was also decided that the name of the archdiocese should be Kalocsa-Bacs. Bacs remained the residence of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and likewise their burialplace, until 1526, when after the battle of Moh&aacute;cs it fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. When first established the archdiocese was very extensive. It embraced the lands between the Danube and the Theiss from Domsod, which is situated to the south of <a href="../cathen/15525b.htm">V&aacute;cz</a> (Waitzen), southwards as far as Titel, including also within its territories a portion of Syrmia. As early as 1229 it suffered its first diminution of territory, when Syrmia was formed into a separate diocese.

<p>The history of the archdiocese and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Kalocsa-Bacs is closely interwoven with that of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was Astrik, who later appears as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>. It is not quite clear whether the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was personal to Astrik, or was also transmissible to his successors, for, while his immediate successor, George, is spoken of as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, his second successor, Desiderius, is spoken of only as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Then again Desiderius's successor, Fabianus, is called <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Kalocsa from the beginning was next in rank to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>. In 1175, when Gran was vacant, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Kalocsa was chosen to crown B&eacute;la III; likewise, in 1204, Archbishop John <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Ladislaus III. Supported by these two precedents the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Kalocsa claimed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to crown the kings of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. In 1212 the question was so far settled that, in case Gran should be vacant, or its <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> should decline to act, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to crown the sovereign belonged to Kalocsa. Archbishop Saul (1192-1202) was held in great esteem by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which sought his opinion on many questions. Under Ugrin (1219-41) occured the foundation of the great <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in Kalocsa, and the establishment of the Diocese of Syrmia in 1229. In this time also the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the Patarenes in Bosnia broke out, and, more especially after the establishment of the See of Syrmia, these <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the Patarenes and other unbelievers were the chief occupation of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. Ugrin also took part in the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Andrew II. He fell in the battle of Muhi against the Tatar hordes in 1241. Archbishop Ladislaus (1317-37) was distinguished for great <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> learning. Andrew Brenti (1413-31) took an important part in the preparations for the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>. Stephan V&aacute;rday (1456-71) was distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> culture. He had studied at <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and brought back with him a taste for the splendour of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. As chancellor and intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">King Matthias Corvinus</a>, he was on of the most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoters of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a> and the renaissance in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Thanks to the recommendation of the king, he had the distinction of being the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Kalocsa to the named <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, but died before receiving the insignia. Peter V&aacute;radi (1480-1501) was also one of Matthias's confidants, but for some unknown reason forfeited the royal favour, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in 1484, and regained his freedom only after the king's death in 1490. He thenceforth devoted his energies mainly to the re-establishment of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. To this end he held a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, instituted canonical visitations of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, turned his attention to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, sent young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> for more extensive study, and founded a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. He also regulated the temporalities of the archidiocese.

<p>Archbishop Paul Tomori (1523-26) led the <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a> army in the decisive struggle against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, meeting his death in the disastrous battle of Moh&aacute;cs in 1526. The territories of the archdiocese were now overrun by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, who prevented the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> from exercising their authority. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> continued to appoint to the archdiocese, but the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> possessed only the title without being able to exercise any real <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. George Draskovich (1572-87) took a conspicuous part in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and received the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat. The population diminished at first under <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> rule, but as early as 1550 Dalmatian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> began to immigrate, and the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> subsequently increased. To satisfy the religious requirements of the population, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> adopted the expedient of treating the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> as missionary territory, and turned over the care of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. This condition lasted through the whole period of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> domination. Leopold Kolonits (1691-5) was first in a position to enter into personal occupation of the archdiocese, and resume <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, whereupon the archdiocese ceased to be a missionary district. Still, for a time it was governed by vicars. Paul Szechenyi (1696-1710), the second of this <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to become <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Kalocsa (the first, George Szechenyi, was <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> from 1668 to 1685), played an important part as mediator between Prince Francis Rak&oacute;czy II and the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Viennese</a> Court, but his efforts to effect a reconciliation were fruitless. A new <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> curia at Kalocsa was begun in his time, and also the reconstruction of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, etc. Count George Csaky (1710-32), successor of the last-mentioned, laid the foundation of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His successor, Count Gabriel Patachich, may be looked upon as the second founder of the archdiocese. He removed the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> residence permanently to Kalocsa, and concentrated all his efforts on the reorganization of the archdiocese. He built the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. Among the recent <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> may be specially mentioned Count Franz Nadasdy, whose short reign (1845-51) was devoted mainly to charitable works, but who also played an important part in the political events of these years; Joseph Kunszt (1852-66), who has perpetuated his name in various religious institutions. <a href="../cathen/07161b.htm">Archbishop Lajos Haynald</a> is treated in a separate article. The present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is Julius V&aacute;rosy. St. Stephen is now the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the archdiocese, although it was originally under the protection of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul the Apostle</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church is dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> chapter of Kalocsa was founded at the same time as the archdiocese. At first it was richly endowed, but in time became so impoverished that <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> reduced the number of canons from twelve to six, but <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>, in 1376, raised the number to ten, where it remained until the battle of Moh&aacute;cs in 1526. There was another chapter at Bacs, already mentioned, but <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> rule put an end to both. The chapter at Bacs was never re-established, but that of Kalocsa was revived by Archbishop Count Gabriel Patachich in 1738. <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> gave the members the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to wear the <em>cappa magna</em>, and the chapter also recovered its right as <em>locus credibilis</em>. There were four canons until 1763, when another stall was established, with which, in memory of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> chapter of Bacs, the title of Provost of Bacs was associated. Finally, in 1776, the number of canons was increased to ten, a figure which obtains to the present day. In 1779 <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> granted to the canons the badge which they still wear. The Archbishopric of Kalocsa-Bacs has today as suffragans the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/04558b.htm">Csan&aacute;d</a>, Grosswardein (Lat. Rite), and the (titular) See of Knin (Tinin). The archbishopric is divided into three archdeaconries &#151; the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and those of Bacs and Theiss &#151; subdivided into 16 vice-archdeaconries. Besides the 10 regular <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons, the archdiocese contains 8 titular stalls, 9 titular abbacies, and 10 titular provostships. The number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches is 126; of chapels-of-ease, 226; of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 105; of curates-in-charge, 23. The total number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the archdiocese is 284; of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 46. There are 5 orders in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> with 143 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and 32 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> with 548 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to give <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> is still exercised by 27 patrons. The population numbers 940,038, of whom 647,408 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 265,842 non-Catholics, 26,379 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, while 409 are attached to no denomination.
