<h1>Archdiocese of Lima</h1>  

<p>(Limana).

<p>The city of Lima, in the Department of the same name, is the capital of the Republic of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, South America. After the conquest of the Incas in the sixteenth century, Pizarro, convinced of the necessity of a capital near the coast, chose about 600 feet above the sea level, on the right bank of the River Rimac (of which name <em>Lima</em> is probably a corruption), and the first stone of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in the wide <em>plaza</em> was laid by Pizarro, on 18 January 1535. <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a> had been the Inca capital, and in 1534 Fray Valverde had been named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>. Lima continued to grow in importance, and in 1543 was made the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which became an archdiocese in 1545. Its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Loaysa. He died in 1575 and was succeeded by St. Torribio Mogrovejo, who died of fever contracted in the forests where he was visiting and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the Indians, whose language (Quichua) he had mastered. In 1551 the University of San Marcos, the first in the new world, was founded at Lima, and to this day it remains autonomous, and outside all Government influence. It is an important seat of learning, having eight faculties, including <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. In 1567 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> arrived at Lima, began founding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges, and introduced the printing press. It is of interest that the first book printed in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> was a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> issued from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> press at Juli on Lake Titicaca in 1577.

<p>Owing to its commodious harbour at Callao, nine miles distant, the town of Lima developed rapidly and was the centre of the Spanish trade monopoly, which lasted until the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). Its domestic affairs followed the changing fortunes of the viceroys of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> throughout the Colonial period (1542-1816). San Martin broke the Spanish power in 1821, and on 28 February, 1823, Riva Ag&uuml;ero entered upon office as first President of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, and took over the government of Lima.

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, Lima was assaulted and fell, 14 January, 1881; its national <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was turned into a barrack, and many valuable books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were destroyed or sold as waste paper. Works of art were carried off or broken by the victorious <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chileans</a>, who occupied the town for two years and nine months. After the evacuation Lima suffered from the political rivalries of C&aacute;ceres and Iglesias, and there was civil discord until the presidency of Nicolas de Pi&eacute;rola (1895), who in 1899 yielded the office to Eduardo Roma&ntilde;a, a Stonyhurst scholar, who held it until 1903. Everything now (1910) promises peace, political discussions are kept within bounds, and party government is carried on without bitterness or undue friction.

<p>There are three ways of ways of reaching Lima from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> or North America:

<ul> <li>by sailing to Colon, crossing the Isthmus of Panama, and taking a boat from <a href="../cathen/11438a.htm">Panama</a> to Callao; <li>via the Straits of Magellan; <li>by going to the river port of Iquitos, 2500 miles up the Amazon from the Atlantic, whence by steamer and rail, the journey to Lima is about 1200 miles.</ul>

<p>The trade with Lima and Callao is largely in the hands of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> merchants. The main exports are sugar, cotton, olives, wool, and tobacco. The city is built in parallel and cross streets, with a central <em>plaza</em> of which the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> occupies one side, and the various government buildings extend along another. At various times it has been damaged by earthquakes, the most serious being that of 1746, when Callao was swept away by a tidal wave, and Lima was almost reduced to ruins. The public buildings are handsome, and include the House of Congress and the Exposition Park. Spanish architecture predominates, and a walk through the streets is like a chapter in stone from old <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Among the monuments are the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Bolivar, the "Second of May" monument (commemorating the defeat of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> in 1866), and the Bolognesi monument. The population is variously computed at between 140,000 and 150,000. The press is ably represented by two daily papers, the "Comercio" and the "Prensa". Education is free and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> and the public exercise of religion other than the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, while allowed by courtesy, is not recognized by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>, was begun when Pizarro founded Lima; it took ninety years to build, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1625. It suffered considerably from the earthquake of 1746, and in the restoration which followed the two great towers were added. It is a handsome structure with five <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> and ten sides <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, one of which contains the remains of Pizarro. Its artistic treasures are valuable, and its <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is adorned with a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> by <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillo</a>. Other churches of note in the town of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, La Merced, and San Augustin. San Pedro and San Pablo formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a> was built by Pizarro, and contains <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>. There are, moreover, twelve <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, including Santa Rosa, where the body of Saint Rose, Lima's <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, is preserved. In all there are sixty-six <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> or establishments in the town.

<p>The archdiocese includes the Department of Lima, having an area of 13,310 square miles and a population of 250,000. At the present time its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> are <a href="../cathen/01701b.htm">Arequipa</a>, <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>, <a href="../cathen/12569a.htm">Puno</a>, <a href="../cathen/07506a.htm">Hu&aacute;nuco</a>, <a href="../cathen/02164a.htm">Ayacucho</a>, <a href="../cathen/07506b.htm">Huaraz</a>, <a href="../cathen/15070b.htm">Trujillo</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03551b.htm">Chachapoyas</a>. The last <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was Bartholom&eacute; de las Heras, who was expelled by San Martin, in 1821. He returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he died at the age of eighty, in 1823. The See of Lima remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> until June, 1834, when a native <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was installed. The present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Pedro Manuel Garcia Naranjo, was born at Lima, 29 April, 1838, and was appointed 19 December, 1907
