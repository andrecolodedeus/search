<h1>Archdiocese of Manfredonia</h1>  

<p>(SIPONTINA)

<p>The city of Manfredonia is situated in the province of <a href="../cathen/06123b.htm">Foggia</a> in Apulia, Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, on the borders of Mount Gargano. It was built by King Manfred in 1256 not far from the ruins of the ancient Sipontum, destroyed by an earthquake in 1233. Sipontum was a flourishing Greek colony; having fallen into the hands of the Samnites, it was retaken about 335 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> by King Alexander of Epirus, uncle of Alexander the Great. In 189 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> it became a Roman colony, and in <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 663 it was taken and destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. In the ninth century, Sipontum was for a time in the power of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>; ln 1042 the Normans made it the seat of one of their twelve counties. The latter won a decisive victory there over the Byzantine general Argyrus in 1052. According to legend, the Gospel was preached at Sipontum by St. Peter and by St. Mark; more trust, however, may be placed in the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> and his companions under <a href="../cathen/06366a.htm">Gallienus</a> and Maximian about 255. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose date may be fixed, was Felix, who was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 465. In the time of Bishop Lawrence, during the reign of Gelasius I (492-496), took place on Mt. Gargano the apparition of <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a>, in memory of which the famous Monastery of the Archangel was founded. About 688 Pope Vitalian was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to entrust to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> the pastoral care of Sipontum, which was almost abandoned, but the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was re-established in 1034, and under Bishop Saint Gerard (1066) it became an archdiocese. The ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> remained still at Sipontum, but, with the building of Manfredonia, the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> was transferred to the latter city. Among the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Matteo Orsini (1327), later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarione</a> (1447), administrator; Niccol&ograve; Pecotto (1458), a Greek scholar and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>; Giovanni del Monte (1512), subsequently <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>; Domenico Ginnasio (1586), who suppressed the use of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> at the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Sipontum, a custom which had obtained until his day; Antonio Marcello (1643) who founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1620; Vincenzo Orsini (1675), afterwards <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. In 1818 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Manfredonia was made perpetual administrator of the Diocese of Viesti, a see that dates at least from the eleventh century. The archdiocese is divided into 16 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; contains 101,800 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious house</a> of men and 4 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and 4 <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> institutes for girls.
