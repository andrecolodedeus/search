<h1>Archdiocese of Manila</h1>  

<p>(DE MANILA)

<p>This archdiocese comprises the city of Manila, the provinces of Bataan, Bulacan, Cavite, Mindoro, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Rizal, Tarlac, and Zambales; and the Districts of Infanta and Marinduque in the Province of Tayabas. The area of this territory is 18,175 square miles. The population, nearly all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, is estimated at 1,642,582. By the appointment (March, 1910) of the Rt. Rev. Jos&eacute; Patrelli as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lipa, Batangas, the provinces of Batangas and Laguna were separated from the archdiocese of which they had until then been a part. The archdiocese includes some 270 towns, or, more properly, townships or counties, since each town may include, together with the <em>pueblo</em> several <em>barrios</em> (villages) with a population of two or three thousand each. There are in the archdiocese 225 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 182 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> representing nine <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, 252 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (196 of which have resident priests), 70 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, 309 members of nine <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, a preparatory and a general <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, one <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, 52 colleges, academies, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with a total attendance of about 5000, and 9 <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> with approximately 2000 inmates.
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>Manila was formerly occupied by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> under Legaspi on 19 May, 1571. The natives whom the missionaries found there were <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolators</a>, ancestor-worshippers, and worshippers of the sun, moon, and stars, of animals and birds. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> (Moros) from Mindanao, however, had begun to force their creed among the natives before Legaspi arrived, and he was accompanied by Augustinian Friars, who immediately began to explain the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrines of Christianity</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. Their conversion was rapid, and in a comparatively short time churches were erected, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> opened, and a printing press established. The ease with which the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> conquered these Islands was due to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the missionaries. That the Filipinos have remained loyal to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is attested by the Philippine Commission (Atkinson, "The Philippine Islands", p. 329).

<p>The See of Manila, with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a> and suffragan to Mexico, was erected in 1578. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Domingo de Salazar (born 1512), arrived in Sept., 1581. One of the first acts of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was to publish (21 Dec., 1581) regulations for the government of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. He appointed a dean, canons, and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> officials, and in 1582 convoked a synod at Manila, interrupting it until 1586 on account of the absence from the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Sanchez. There were ninety <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, and six <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, at the council. After ten years of energetic work Salazar went to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to plead the cause of the Filipinos before the King. He was nominated <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Manila, with suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> at <a href="../cathen/03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a>, <a href="../cathen/11148a.htm">Nueva C&aacute;ceres</a>, and Nueva Segovia (Vigan). To these were added the <a href="../cathen/08323d.htm">Diocese of Jaro</a>, in 1865, and four other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, in 1902. Salazar died at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 4 Dec., 1594, before receiving the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of his appointment from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to reach Manila was the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Ignacio de Santiba&ntilde;ez. He took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1798, but died three months later. Five years passed before a successor was appointed, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Miguel de Benavides, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11149b.htm">Nueva Segovia</a> in Northern Luzon. The new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> had come to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> in 1587. He had laboured among the Chinese of Manila and built the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of San Gabriel for them. He was the founder of the celebrated University of Santo Tom&aacute;s at Manila, which exists to this day. During the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopacy</a> of his successor, Diego Vasquez de Mercado, there arrived in Manila a large band of confessors exiled from <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. Colin's "Labor Evangelica", pp. 434-562.

<p>Among the other <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> who filled the See of Manila were: Miguel Garcia Serrano, an Augustinian, noted for his great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life; Hernando Guerrero, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, who had laboured for more than thirty years among the Tagalos and Pampangans; Fernando Montero de Espinosa; Miguel Poblete, who rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and himself went about the city soliciting <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for that purpose; Felipe Pardo, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, who was banished from the city by the Audiencia, but was later restored; Francisco de la Cuesta, a <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a>, who, together with a large number of prominent <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by the tyrannical governor Bustamente, in Fort Santiago, whence he was afterwards taken and forced by the populace to accept the governorship of the islands <em>ad interim,</em> in place of Bustamente. Manuel Rojo, who took possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> 22 July, 1759, had been also appointed governor-general of the islands. During his rule the English, under Draper, besieged and captured Manila and then pillaged the city so wantonly that Draper himself was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to interfere. In order to raise the money demanded by the English, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to surrender all his <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, even to his own pastoral ring. Archbishop Pedro Payo, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, built the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at a cost of about $500,000. Bernardino Nozaleda, also a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, was the last <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> under the Spanish domination, resigning his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1901. The archdiocese was then administered by the Rt. Rev. Martin Garcia y Alcocer, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a>, until the appointment of the first American <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the Most Rev. Jeremiah J. Harty. Archbishop Harty was born at St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, 1 Nov., 1853, made his early studies under the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> University of St. Louis, entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Cape Girardeau in 1873, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 28 April, 1878. He had held various cures of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the Archdiocese of St. Louis, and had founded the Parish of St. Leo in that city, when <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> appointed him to the See of Manila by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 8 August, 1903. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 15 August, of the same year, <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> on 9 Nov., and took possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on 16 Jan., 1904. An Apostolic delegation to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a> was inaugurated in 1902 with the Most Rev. John Baptist Guidi, who died at Manila, 26 June, 1904, and was replaced two months later by the Most Rev. Ambrose Agius, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>. Monsignor Agius convoked the first <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, which was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> opened in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Manila on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, 1907.


<h2 id="section2">Religious orders</h2>

<p>Sawyer, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writer, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, says: "The <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> have fared badly at the hands of several writers on the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>; but it will be noticed that those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the least about them speak the worst of them" ("The Inhabitants of the Philippines", p. 65). "The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders . . . were hardy and adventurous pioneers of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and in the evangelization of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, by persuasion and teaching, they did more for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and civilization than any other missionaries of modern times. Of undaunted <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, they have ever been to the front when calamities threatened their flocks. In epidemics of plague and cholera they have not been dismayed, nor have they ever in such cases abandoned their flocks. . . . They have done much for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, having founded <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for both sexes, training colleges for teachers, the University of St. Thomas in Manila and other institutions. Hospitals and asylums attest their charity. They were formerly, and even lately, the protectors of the poor against the rich, and of the native against the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. They have consistently resisted the enslavement of the natives. They restrained the constant inclination of the natives to wander away into the woods and return to primitive savagery by keeping them in the towns, or, as they said, 'under the bells'" (ibid., p. 75).

<p>The first missionaries in the Archdiocese of Manila were Augustinians. They arrived in Ceb&uacute;, with Legaspi, in 1565, and six years later opened a house at Manila which became the central house of their order in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. They founded the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Tondo (Manila), Tambobong, and Pasig. In the Province of Bulacan they established the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Dapdap, Guiguinto, Bigaa, Angat, Baliuag, Quingua, Malolos, Paombong, Calumpit, and Hagonoy. In the Province of Pampanga they founded <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> at Bacolor, Macabebe, Porac, Mexico, Arayat, and Apalit. They had their churches also at Tarlac, San Miguel de Mayumo, and Candaba. In the Province of Batangas they founded the towns (now numbering from 20,000 to 40,000 inhabitants) of Taal, Balayan, Bauan, Batangas, Tanauan, and Lipa. They became masters of the dialects of the tribes among whom they laboured, reduced the languages to a system, and published grammars, dictionaries, and books of devotion for the natives. In all their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (and this may be said equally of the other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders) they erected magnificent stone churches which remain to this day as a lasting memorial to their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and church at <a href="../cathen/07043a.htm">Guadalupe</a> (near Manila) and their church at Malolos, one of the largest in the islands, were destroyed during the Filipino insurrection; but even the ruins bear splendid testimony to the Apostolic <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of these fervent missionaries.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> arrived at Manila 24 June, 1577. They were the first missionaries in the districts of Sampaloc and Santa Ana, Manila, and in the towns of Meycauayan, Bocaue, Morong, Baraa, Pagsanjan, Santa Cruz de la Laguna, and Mainit. They also established numerous <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the Provinces of Tayabas and Camarines. A <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, porter in the Convent of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, Manila, was the founder of the San Lazaro <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> in 1598. Five years later the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was removed outside the city; since the American occupation it has been in the possession of the American Government, though the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> cross still remains over the entrance. The Emperor of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> was responsible in a great measure for the increase of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> in the Islands, as he sent a shipload of the unfortunates to Manila with the double purpose of ridding his country of them and of manifesting his displeasure at the spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in his empire. He is reported to have sent a message with the convoy to the effect that, as the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> were so fond of caring for the sick, he desired to gratify their wishes by presenting them with the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>. To the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> is probably due, in great measure, the striking devotion to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Our Lord</a> which exists today among the Filipino people.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to arrive in the islands came with Bishop Salazar in 1581. One of them, Father Sedeno, had been a missionary in <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>. He opened the first <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> and founded colleges at Manila and <a href="../cathen/03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a>. He taught the Filipinos to cut stone, to make mortar, to weave, and to sew. He brought artists from <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> to teach them to draw and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a>, and erected the first stone building in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the patroness of the whole group of islands. His companion, Father Sanchez, was one of the most remarkable men of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in his day, and by a unanimous vote of all the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> of the colony, was sent to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to treat with Philip II and with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on the affairs of the colony. He was accompanied by a Filipino boy, a Pampangan youth named Martin, who later returned to his native land as the first Filipino <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>. The college and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of San Jos&eacute; was established by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of Manila in 1595. Though no longer under the control of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, it still exists, and is therefore the oldest of the colleges of the archipelago. By royal decree of 12 March, 1653, it took precedence of all centres of learning in the islands. During the first hundred years of its existence it counted among its <em>alumni</em> 8 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 39 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (4 of whom became <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a>), 11 Augustinians, 18 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of various branches of the order, 3 <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and 39 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> University of St. Ignatius, which opened its first classes in 1587, was confirmed as a pontifical <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1621, and asa royal <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1653. Besides their college and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for the training of their order at San Pedro Macati, near Manila. The solid stone church still exists, but today only massive ruins remain of the seventeenth-century <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> also possessed a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Cavite. They built the famous sanctuary of Antipolo, at present the most frequented place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in the islands. They established the Parishes of Santa Cruz and of San Miguel, Manila. They published numerous works in the Tagalog dialect, and some of their great folio dictionaries of that tongue exist today. Expelled from the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> in 1768, it was not until 1859 that they were permitted to continue the work they had begun 278 years before. They opened the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the Ateneo, which, from <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> beginnings became a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of secondary instruction in 1865, and now numbers about 1500 students, and they established a normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which, since the American occupation, has become a combined preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and college under the title of San Xavier. (See also <a href="../cathen/09601a.htm">MANILA OBSERVATORY</a>.)

<p>The first band of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missionaries to reach the islands arrived in Manila in 1587. A full account of the immense good accomplished by these fathers will be found in Fonseca's "Historia de la Provincia del Santisimo Rosario". In 1611 they founded the University of Santo Tom&aacute;s which was confirmed as a pontifical <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1645 and as a royal <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1680. In 1836 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> petitioned <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> for authority to establish a chair of Spanish and Insular Law. The petition was granted, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> department of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was begun. In 1871 departments of medicine and pharmacy were opened. As these drew revenue from the estate of the old San Jos&eacute; College, they are now known as the San Jos&eacute; College. The College of <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a> de Letr&aacute;n was begun by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers in 1640; it was elevated to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of secondary instruction in 1867. The students, who number about 1000, follow the usual college course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Of the professors of Santo Tom&aacute;s about thirty have been raised to the episcopal dignity, and one student, a native Chinese named Gregorio Lopez, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nanking, where he died in 1670. What is now the University Press was established at the end of the sixteenth century, before the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> itself. It was first established in the Hospital of San Gabriel, later transferred to Bataan, and in 1623 it was removed to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, where it has continued until the present day. During its long career the University Press has issued countless works of a religious and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> character, not only in the modern and classical languages, but in various native dialects of the Islands. Greek, Hebrew, and Sanskrit are included in its rich assortment of type. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">San Domingo</a> at Manila, which was rebuilt for the fifth time in 1868, contains the famous <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady of the Rosary</a> which is carried in solemn procession every year through the streets of Manila attended by a vast multitude of people from every part of the islands. That the devotion to the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Holy Rosary</a> is so deeply implanted in the hearts of the Filipino people, is due mainly to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers. Like their companions in missionary labours, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> extended their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> work in numerous provinces of the islands, founding towns, establishing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, building magnificent churches, opening <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and publishing books in the native dialects.

<p>The Recollect Fathers were first established in the archdiocese in 1600. Besides their work in Manila, where they have two large churches, the Recollects have converted the tribes in Mariveles and Zambales. Their apostolic labours have been extended to the lands of Mindoro, Tablas, Masbate, Burias, Ticao, Paragua, the Calamianes, Negros, and Mindanao. The <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> fathers came to Manila in 1862 to care for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. Since the American occupation the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of the archdiocese have been under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> continue in charge of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of <a href="../cathen/03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a>, Jaro (Iloilo), and <a href="../cathen/11148a.htm">Nueva C&aacute;ceres</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> fathers are in charge of two churches at Manila. They came to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> in 1886 to assume charge of the missions in the Caroline and Palaos Islands. The fathers of the Order of St. Benedict were first established in Manila in 1895. In 1901 they founded the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of San Beda, which has an attendance of about 400 students.

<p>A community of <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> was established at Manila in 1621. The sisters, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, mestizas, and natives, occupy the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Santa Clara, Manila. In 1694 Ignacia del Espiritu Santo founded the Congregation of the Sisters of the Blessed Virgin. The members are all natives. They conduct a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, to which is attached a home for aged <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. A large number of them are engaged in teaching in various mission stations of Mindanao. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a> opened their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Manila in 1698. They conduct the College of Santa Catalina. The Sisters of Santa Rita date their origin from 1730. They have charge of the Santa Rita Academy. The <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a> are in charge of the Colleges of Santa Isabel, of <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a>, and of Santa Rosa; of the Hospicio de San Jos&eacute;, of the Hospital of <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a> de Dios, of the School and Orphan Asylum of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> (Looban), all at Manila. They entered the archdiocese in 1862. The establishment of the <a href="../cathen/02006a.htm">Sisters of the Assumption</a> at Manila was made in 1892. The sisters are in charge of a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for young ladies and a free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the poor. The Augustinian Sisters are native <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who conduct the Academy of Our Lady of Consolation. The <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres</a> were established at Manila in 1904. Besides their <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work and a large <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of native nurses in the city, they have charge of several academies in the provinces. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters came to the islands from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1906. They established the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of St. Scholastica, and have organized in their <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> the devotion of the Perpetual Adoration.
<h2>Charitable institutions</h2>

<p>The Hospital of <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a> de Dios, situated in the Walled City of Manila, was founded in 1596 by the Confraternity of Santa Misericordia. In 1656 it passed into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02802b.htm">Order of St. John of God</a>, and in 1886 it was put under the care of the Sisters of Charity, who still conduct the institution. The <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was twice destroyed by earthquakes, and was severely damaged by the storm of 1882. The generosity of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> people, especially of the governor-general and of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, restored it; the building was enlarged and now occupies a large city square. The patients, the majority of whom are Filipinos, number between four hundred and five hundred, a fourth of whom are charity patients, supported by the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. St. Paul's Hospital, at present the best equipped <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in the Far East, was founded by Archbishop Harty in 1905. It is under the care of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres</a>. There are about 200 patients. The Hospicio de San Jos&eacute; is situated on an island in the Pasig River, adjacent to the Ayala Bridge, Manila. It was founded in 1806, and is under the care of the Sisters of Charity. It contains an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> for boys and girls, a home for the aged, a <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling asylum</a>, an insane asylum for men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, a reform <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for youthful <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> sentenced by the courts, and a department for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> with children under two years of age. There are about 600 inmates in this institution, which is supported by government appropriation and by donations of the charitable. A native <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who became a Sister of Charity, gave her home and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> for the founding of the Asylum of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, which is conducted by that congregation. It contains an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> for girls and an academy for extern students. The asylum is supported by charitable donations and by the sale of <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> made by the inmates. The College of Santa Isabel was founded in 1632 for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of Spanish <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> girls. It was supported until 1640 by the Confraternity of Mercy. In 1861 the College of Santa Potenciana was combined with that of Santa Isabel. At present the institution, besides providing for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, conducts a boarding- and day-school. The Monte de Piedad is a charitable pawnbroking establishment which was opened in 1880. Money is loaned to the poor at the rate of 6 per cent per annum. (The rate in Manila for small loans is commonly 5 per cent per month, and a much higher rate is not uncommon.) <a href="../cathen/08077a.htm">Interest</a> at 4 per cent per annum is allowed on all deposits. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Manila is the President of the Board of Directors of the Monte de Piedad. There are about 2000 students in Manila who have come from the provinces to attend the advanced classes of the government <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. To protect these boys and girls from the dangers to which they would be exposed in a large city, far removed from the salutary influence of home, to provide them, also, with the religious instruction of which they are deprived in the government <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, Archbishop Harty established in 1906 a dormitory for boys, and in 1909 one for girls. Board and lodging are furnished in these establishments at from $7.50 to $9.00 a month.
