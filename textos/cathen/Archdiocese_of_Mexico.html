<h1>Archdiocese of Mexico</h1>  

<p>(MEXICANA.)
<h2>Boundaries</h2>

<p>The boundaries of the Diocese of Mexico were at first not well defined. When Cuba was discovered three sees were erected, but when the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> arrived, their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> had been destroyed, and the inhabitants had fled. In order to avoid such mistakes, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> allowed the kings of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to fix the boundaries of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> erected on the American continent, still considered a part of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. From 1500 to 1863 the Diocese of Mexico extended from the Atlantic to the Pacific, namely from Tampico to Acapulco. At present it is confined to the Federal District, the States of Morelos, Mexico, and part of Hidalgo.
<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Zum&aacute;rraga, came to Mexico when <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> had just been released from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in Castel Sant' Angelo, where he was kept by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> for several months after the sack of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Bourbon's army. Strange as it may seem, he was allowed and even <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to come with only the emperor's <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>, governed the diocese without any <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> appointment, and styled himself "Omnimoda potestate Antistes". He returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, received his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> six years after his first arrival on the American continent. He has been falsely accused of having destroyed most valuable monuments; he ought not to be blamed for having burnt the idols, <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, and hieroglyphics which prevented the conversion of the aborigines. In his time the Blessed Virgin, according to Mexican tradition, appeared to the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a> Juan Diego, and became the patroness of America. He introduced the first printing office in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, published many books, founded many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges, and was a saintly man, a faithful follower of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, to whose order he belonged. He ruled over the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, raised before he died to the rank of an archdiocese, from 1528 to 1548.

<p>Five provincial councils have been held in the city of Mexico. The first and second under the second <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Alonso de Montufar. The third was presided over by the third <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Pedro Moya de Contreras. The twenty-fourth <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Francisco Antonio de Lorenzana assembled and presided over the fourth provincial council in 1770. Prospero Alarc&oacute;n, thirty-second <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, was the president of the fifth and last provincial council in 1896. The most important of all was the third council, which has been for centuries the code of ecclesiastical law for the Mexican Church.

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Moya de Contreras, Garc&iacute;a Guerra, <a href="../cathen/11414a.htm">Palafox</a>, Osorio, Ortega, Haro y Peralta, and Lizana y Beaumont were also viceroys and captains-general of New Spain, and were as able to brandish the sword as to wield the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>. Archbishop Labastida was regent of the short lived empire of Maximilian. He was the last <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> to be invested with any political authority.

<p>The most distinguished of the line was Francisco Antonio de Lorenzana, transferred to Toledo, and created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a>. He published several important books, founded many institutions both in New and Old <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, helped with his own means <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> when he was sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, and largely contributed to the support of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> assembled in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> that elected <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>.

<p>A few years after the conquest, viz., in the beginning of the sixteenth century, the Archdiocese of Mexico already possessed over fifty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, equal to that of Salamanca, several colleges, and numberless <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Their number went on increasing, until all religious progress was stopped by the War of Independence and the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> that followed. All were destroyed by law and in reality under President Ju&aacute;rez. President Diaz has treated the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> better; but the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> have not been repealed. The present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Mgr. Mora y del Rio was born at Pajuacar&aacute;n, 24 Feb., 1854; studied at Zamora and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, 22 Dec., 1877; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14473a.htm">Tehuantepec</a>, 19 Jan., 1893; and promoted to the See of Mexico, 2 Dec., 1908 in succession to Mgr. Alarc&oacute;n. The population almost entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is about 780,000.
