<h1>Archdiocese of Michoacan</h1>  

<p>(MICHOACANENSIS)

<p>Located in Mexico, the Diocese of Michoacan was established in 1536 by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> at the instance of the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, its boundaries to coincide with those of the ancient Kingdom of Michoacan. In 1863 it became an archdiocese, with L&eacute;on, <a href="../cathen/12601b.htm">Quer&eacute;taro</a>, and Zamora for suffragans, its limits being at the same time greatly reduced. Its population is about one million, and the principal cities are Morelia, Zit&aacute;cuaro, Maravat&iacute;o, P&aacute;tzcuaro, Puru&aacute;ndiro, and Piedad in the State of Michoacan, and Ac&aacute;mbaro, Salvatierra, Celaya, Salamanca, and P&eacute;njamo in the State of Guanajuato. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the eminent <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> D. Vasco de Quiroga (1538-65), one of the greatest missionaries to the Mexican aborigines. Among other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Spanish period, the following were distinguished for their learning and virtue: Ram&iacute;rez del Prado, who has been compared to <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>; S&aacute;nchez* de Tagle, who founded the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (<em>seminario tridentino</em>) for the diocese in 1770; Fray Antonio de San Miguel, builder of the great aqueduct of Morelia and commonly spoken of as the father of his people. Of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have governed the Diocese of Michoacan only two have been natives of Mexico, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and Mungu&iacute;a. The latter was named <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in 1863. <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> was the first American ecclesiastic to be named a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, although he died before receiving the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat. Mungu&iacute;a was the author of some very excellent books on law and philosophy, and lived up to his motto: "Lose wealth, but save principles". D.Ignacio Arciga and D. Atenogenes Silva succeeded Archbishop Mungu&iacute;a and, in the epoch of peace which the republic has since enjoyed, have achieved some notable results.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Seminary of Morelia numbers 76,000 volumes; there is also a physical laboratory and valuable <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> apparatus. In every one of the 64 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and the 18 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the archdiocese there is at least one <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys and another for girls. At Morelia the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are very numerous, the attendance being over three thousand, boys and girls. Celaya, Salvatierra, and Piedad have four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> each, and several other <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have two. Several <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> are admirably maintained by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In times of scarcity, when the price of corn goes up, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authorities follow the example of the great Bishop San Miguel, who, in 1785, with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, expended 280,000 pesos for the relief of the people &mdash; an enormous sum for those days. During the two last episcopates the improvement has been notable, the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> increasing to 348. Hidalgo, Morelas, Iturbide, heroes of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of Independence, the learned Mungu&iacute;a, the poet Navarrete, and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Abarca were all born within the limits of the Archdiocese of Michoacan. Morelia, the capital, has some notable buildings, among which may be mentioned the beautiful <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the government buildings, the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, the art <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (formerly a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>), and the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the Teresianas. In the same city the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servants of Mary</a> conduct institutions. The classes in the various <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are taught principally by French and Italian professors and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>.
