<h1>Archdiocese of Milan</h1>  

<p>(MEDIOLANENSIS)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated on the Orona River, which, with three canals, the Naviglio Grande (1257-72), the Naviglio Martesana (1457), and the Naviglio di Pavia (1805-19), is the highway of the commerce of this great industrial centre, called the moral capital of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The soil is very fertile and there is extensive cattle-raising and manufacturing throughout the province. The name of Milan is probably derived from the Celtic <em>met lan</em>, which means "in the middle of the plain". The city was founded in 396 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> by the Insubres, on the site of the ruined Melpum, and became the chief centre of the Cisalpine Gauls. After the defeat of the Gauls near Clastidium, Mediolanum was taken by the consul Lucius Scipio (221) and became a Roman <em>municipium</em>. In 45 <em>B. C.</em> it obtained Roman citizenship, and under the emperors it had famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and was a flourishing city, the Emperor Adrian having made it the seat of the <em>pr&oelig;fectus Liguri&oelig;</em> and Constantine, of the <em>vicarius Itali&oelig;</em>. After <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 296 it was several times the capital of the emperors of the West (<a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian Herculius</a>, Valentinian I, his Son Honorius, and later, of Ricimer and of Odoacer). The edict of toleration of Constantine and Licinius (313) was agreed on and published at Milan. In 452 the town was besieged by <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a>, and in 538 destroyed by Uraia, a nephew of Vitiges, King of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, with a loss, according to Procopius, of 300,000 men. Perchance for this reason the Lombard kings did not thereafter select Milan for their capital, though Bertarius did so during the brief division of the kingdom between the sons of Gundobad (661). After <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, Milan was the seat of counts, whose authority however, was overshadowed by the prestige of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, foremost among whom was Ansperto da Biassono (869-81), who fortified the town and adorned it with beautiful buildings. In 896-97 it endured a severe Siege by the Hungarians, and a century later <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> transferred the title of count to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. The most distinguished of these was Ariberto (1018-45), who induced Conrad II to take the crown of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. With the assistance of the people he made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on Pavia and Lodi (1027), on which account he incurred the enmity of the greater <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lords whom he exiled, but who, leagued together, defeated the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> at Campo Malo (1035), and returning to the city, called Conrad to their assistance; the latter, however, besieged Milan in vain (1037). Though the struggle continued, a noble, Lanzano, and no longer Ariberto, headed the popular party. Finally, nobles and burghers entered into compacts, and this intermingling of the classes brought the commune into existence. At the same time studies, the industries (especially wool), and commerce flourished.

<p>As the power of the burghers grew, that of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> waned, and with it the imperial authority which the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> represented, so that Milan in 1110, refused to pay tribute to Henry V, who had come into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 1116 the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">public authority</a> passed entirely into the hands of consuls elected by the people. Milan made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on cities faithful to the empire: Pavia, <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, Lodi (destroyed 1111), and Como (destroyed 1127). <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> wished to remedy these evils, and in 1158 <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> Milan to swear allegiance to him and to receive an imperial podest&agrave;. This officer was soon driven from the city, but in 1162 after a long siege, Milan was again reduced to obedience, and in part destroyed. The battle of Legnano (1176) secured their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the Lombard cities, and to Milan its consular government; but on many occasions the authority of a foreign podest&agrave; was substituted for the native consuls. The long period of peace was favourable to agriculture (greatly furthered by the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>), also to the wool and the silk industries, in the former of which, throughout Milanese territory, 60,000 men were employed, while the silk industry supported 40,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The struggle against the empire was renewed under <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, who ignored the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> won at the peace of Constance. A second Lombard League was formed, which Frederick defeated at Cortenuova, though he did not succeed in his ulterior purpose. Thereafter Milan entered into further <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> cities, especially with Pavia. The nobility remained favourable to Frederick and to his successors, and this caused internal strife in Milan, and the creation of a new office, that of <em>capitano del popolo</em>. The first to hold it was Pagano della Torre, elected in 1240 by the <em>Credenza di San Ambrogio</em>, the executive branch of the city government, composed of twelve members representative of the three orders of citizens. The legislative power was exercised by the General Council, the number of whose members was variable. The <em>capitano del popolo</em> was <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by the nobles, and when Pagano della Torre was succeeded (1247) by his nephew Martino, under the title of <em>anziano della Credensa</em>, the nobility sought the assistance of Ezzelino da Romano; but Martino overcame the resistance of the nobles, and also defeated Ezzelino, introduced reforms into the public administration, and distributed the public offices with equity. A new civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was prevented by the "peace of St. Ambrose" (1258), at which the equality of nobles and people was agreed on. As conflicts continued, Martino called to his assistance Oberto Pelavicino, a well-known soldier with whose help Martino had finally vanquished Ezzelinoda Romano. In 1263 Filippo, brother of Martino, was real lord of Milan, though he carefully avoided any such title, and as other cities &mdash; Como, <a href="../cathen/09322b.htm">Lodi</a>, <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, also La Valtellina, were subject to Milan, he may be called the founder of the duchy. His nephew Napoleone, under the title of <em>anziano del popolo</em>, exercised supreme power (1265-77), and in his later years was imperial vicar for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, notwithstanding the fact that he was a <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> Ottone Visconti, who since 1262 had been prevented from taking possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, organized the nobles exiled from Milan, and after several battles, succeeded in capturing Napoleone and his relatives, whom he locked up in cages at <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a>.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> then caused himself to be proclaimed perpetual lord, thus putting an end to the Republic of Milan and founding the power of the Visconti, which aimed at the conquest of the entire peninsula, though its real domain was limited by the Alps, the river Sesia, and the Po, while the east extended as far as <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, conquered in 1337. From 1302 to 1311, the della Torre were again in power, Guido of that <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> having driven Matteo I Visconti. from Milan. When the latter returned, he was made imperial vicar by Henry VII, and devoted himself to driving the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> party from the Lombard cities, On this account <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and sent Cardinal Bertrand du Poyet against Matteo. Galeazzo, Matteo's son, continued the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>, and adhered to the party of Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. His son Azzo (1329-59) contributed to the ruin of the Scaligers, obtained <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, and was succeeded by his sons Luchino (1339-49), famous for the refinement of his cruelty, and Giovanni II (1349-54), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Milan, who obtained possession of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and Bologna, though unable to hold either of these towns, or the cities of <a href="../cathen/02018b.htm">Asti</a>, <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. At the death of Giovanni, Milan was divided between three brothers, his nephews: Matteo II, who died in 1355; Galeazzo II (1354-78), and Bernab&ograve; (1354-85) all patrons of literature and of the arts, but odious through their cruelty, misgovernment, and exorbitant taxes. Accordingly, a strong league was formed against them in 1367, by <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Pope Urban V</a>, Charles IV, the towns of Florence, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, and others, but it was prevented, by fortuitous circumstances, from destroying the power of the Visconti. Galeazzo was succeeded by his son Giovanni Galeazzo, who was forced into <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, with his uncle Bernab&ograve;, and having taken him in ambush, cast him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where he died in 1385. The state of the Visconti was thus united again and in 1395, Giovanni Galeazzo received the title of duke. In 1387 he had conquered <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> and <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>. During his reign the duchy of Milan was at the height of its power, and contained the following cities: Pavia, <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a>, <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, Valenza, <a href="../cathen/14784c.htm">Tortona</a>, <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, <a href="../cathen/12717a.htm">Reggio</a>, <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, Belluno, <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. Giovanni Galeazzo was eminent, both for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Pavia is a witness of his religious sentiments and of his taste for the arts. He died in 1402, leaving two Sons, minors, Giovanni Maria and Filippo Maria. During their minority, many conquered possessions were lost; but, Giovanni Maria having been assassinated in 1412, Filippo Maria remained sole duke, and with the assistance of Carmagnola, retook a great portion of the lost territory. The offensive proceeding of Filippo Maria caused the house of Este, the Gonzagas, and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to form a league against him, which led to a long <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; in the course of it, several famous battles were fought, among them that of Maclodio (1427), by which the Duke of Milan lost Bergamo and <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, and the naval battle of Portofino (1431) disastrous to the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> allies of Milan. The peace concluded in 1433 was favourable to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out again, and continued until the death of Filippo Maria, in 1447, when the Ambrosian Republic was proclaimed (1447-50).

<p>For military reasons, Francesco Sforza was made <em>capitano del popolo</em>, and succeeded in taking possession of the fortress and in having himself recognized duke (1450). This event led to a new <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and the King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, closed by the peace of <a href="../cathen/09322b.htm">Lodi</a> in 1454. Francesco was succeeded in 1466 by his son Galeazzo Maria, who, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by his subjects, was stabbed to death in 1476. His son Giovanni Galeazzo had as regent, first his own mother, and then (1480), his ambitious uncle Ludovico il Moro, who succeeded his nephew, at the latter's death in 1494. Louis XII, who pretended to <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over Milan, entered into a compact with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> for the division of the duchy. Ludovico il Moro attempted to resist them, but was constrained to seek refuge in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and Milan came under the power of the French. In 1500, Duke Ludovico returned to his dominions for a time, but other French troops were sent against him, and he died a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The expulsion of the French from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> ensued upon the death of Gaston de Foix, the victor of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (1512), and Milan was given to Maximilian Sforza, a son of Ludovico il Moro, although the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> were its real masters. After the battle of Marignano, Maximilian surrendered Milan at the end of a brief siege, and remained a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. The French had been definitively excluded from the peninsula by the battle of Pavia when Francis II, a brother of Maximilian, became duke, and at his death <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> took the Duchy of Milan for himself, and bequeathed it to his successors on the Spanish throne. The peace of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> (1713) gave Milan to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, which power had occupied the duchy since 1706. During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the Austrian succession, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> dominion over Milan was interrupted for a time (1745), and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> even offered the duchy to <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> and <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> much was done for the prosperity of the Milanese, and civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms were also introduced. In 1796 Milan became the capital of the Cispadan Republic, soon transformed into the Cisalpine Republic, and (1805) into the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>; the Cispadan Republic was supported entirely by French arms, which checked by <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1799), returned victorious, after Marengo. In 1814 the Austrian domination was re-established, and lasted until 1859. Encouraged by the revolution of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1848, Milan revolted, in an effort to throw off the foreign yoke; and the five days (18 to 22 March of that year) remain famous; a provisional committee was formed and the Austrians were compelled to retreat; but the consequent <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> having taken up the cause of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was disastrous to the insurgents; and Milan (with <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>) again became subject to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1859, however, decided the final annexation of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>.

<p>Milan is an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>. According to an eleventh-century legend the Gospel was brought there by St. Barnabas, and the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Milan, St. Anathalon, was a disciple of that apostle. But a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> cannot have been established there before 200, and possibly not till much later, for the list of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Milan names only five predecessors of Merocles, who was at the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (313). During the persecutions several <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at Milan; among them <a href="../cathen/06537a.htm">Saints Gervasius and Protasius</a> (first <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>), St. Victor (304), <a href="../cathen/10666b.htm">Sts. Nabor and Felix</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10728a.htm">Sts. Nazarius and Celsus</a>. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be named St. Eustorgius, St. Protasius, and St. Dionysius, who firmly opposed the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> emperor Constantius, and was exiled to Cappadocia (355), while the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Auxentius was put on the episcopal throne of Milan. But the people remained faithful to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. At the death of St. Dionysius, the great St. Ambrose was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (375-97), vanquished <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, and was the guide of those good princes Gratian, <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian II</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>. He was succeeded by St. Simplicianus (397), and Venerius (400); Lazarus (438-49) appears to have amplified the Ambrosian rite of Milan; Laurentius (490-512) presided over the Roman councils in the cause of Pope Symmachus; St. Datius (530-52), lived almost always in exile at Constantinople, on account of the Gothic War; Vitalis (552) adhered to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> caused by the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">"Three Chapters"</a>, but Auxanus (556) re-established the union of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Honoratus (568) sought refuge in <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, with a great number of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, during the siege of Milan by the Lombard Alboin, and at his death the Milanese at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> elected to succeed him Laurentius II, while Fronto (elected at Milan) was not recognized. When Laurentius died, King Agilulfus wished to secure the election of an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in which, however, he was thwarted by the vigilance of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, and both at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and at Milan, Constantius was elected to the vacant see; under him, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Monza was erected, Agilulfus <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and the conversion of the Lombards to the Faith was begun, while the episcopal residence was again taken up at Milan. The first <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> who bore the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was St. Petrus (784), but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that St. Ambrose had already exercised <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, from Bologna to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king Childebert gave to Bishop Laurentius II the title of Patriarch. St. Petrus established an asylum for foundlings, one of the first institutions of its kind in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Mention has been made above of Ansperto da Biassono.

<p>In 980 Landolfo, a son of the imperial vicar, Bonizo, became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> through <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>; he was driven from the city on account of his abuse of power, but was taken back by the emperor <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, and repaired the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that he had done. He was succeeded by Arnolfo II (998) and Ariberto d'Intimiano (1018), mentioned above. The latter was succeeded by Guido (1045), also a <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniac</a>. At this time the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were deplorable: <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a> were common, and out of these conditions developed the famous <em>pataria</em>, a popular movement for social and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform, headed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Anselmo da Biaggio, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, and by the cleric Arialdo, both of whom used force to compel the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to observe continence, and to drive its members from <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> obtained by <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. From this great confusion ensued. In 1059 <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> sent to Milan <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> and the same Anselmo, at which the people murmured, demanding that the church of Milan be not subject to that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Archbishop Guido, however, promised amendment, and accepted the conditions imposed upon him, but soon relapsed, and Arialdo, with whom the noble warrior Erlembaldo was associated, began again to agitate the people, in consequence of which he was brutally assassinated 27 June, 1066. Erlembaldo then gave a military organization to the <em>pataria</em>, and Guido, who was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, was compelled to leave the city. While the election, of his successor was being discussed, Guido sold the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> dignity to his secretary. Until 1085 there were several pretenders to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>; and in one of the many tumults caused by this condition of affairs Erlembaldo was killed (1074). Under Anselm III order was re-established.

<p>Unfortunately, the <em>pataria</em> had created an anticlerical sentiment in the people, and had prepared them to accept the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>. In fact, the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were more frequently called Patari, and in Milan, one of their chief centres, they maintained a kind of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Archbishop Oberto was exiled by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> in 1162; and though his successor St. Galdino, was elected at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> Milanese, he was able to take possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1167; he reorganized the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> del Broglio. Archbishop Uberto Crivelli became <a href="../cathen/15211a.htm">Pope Urban III</a> in 1185. At an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> election, in 1263 no agreement could be reached, for the people wanted Raimondo della Torre, and the nobles a member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Settala; therefore <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> appointed Ottone Visconti, who was prevented by the Milanese from taking possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> until 1277, when he entered Milan, both as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and as lord. Roberto Visconti, who succeeded John in 1354, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to enter into litigation with his brothers for the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, which they regarded as the personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of their uncle. Among other <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Milan were Pietro Filargo (1402), who became <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>; Fra Gabriele Sforza (1454), an Augustinian, brother of Duke Francesco and founder of the <em>Ospedale Maggiore;</em> and the cardinals Stefano Nardini (1461), Giovanni Arcimboldi (1448), Ippolito d'Este (1497), also the latter's nephew Ippolito (1520). During the incumbency of this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, always absent from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, great abuses grew up which Giovanni Angelo Arcimboldo (1550) and <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> sought to remedy (1561). Here it is enough to mention the latter's <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the reformation of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, his earnestness in preserving the Ambrosian Rite and extending its use throughout the archdiocese (Monza alone retaining the Roman rite), and his foundation of the Oblates for <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> missions. His work was continued by Gaspare Visconti (1584) and by a nephew of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles</a>, Federigo (1594-1631), who was a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, as were all of his successors, to Filippo Visconti (1784-1801), whose <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> by <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, made without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, nearly brought on a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. He was followed by Cardinal Caprara, well-known as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic legate</a> to the court of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. After the death of this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> in 1811 the See of Milan remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for six years; the next <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Cardinal Carlo G&aelig;tano Gaisruck, was appointed in 1818 and governed the diocese until 1848 "more as a soldier than as a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>". He was especially opposed to the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Archbishop Paolo Angelo Ballerini (1859-67) was never able to take possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, because the Italian Government denied him the <em><a href="../cathen/05707a.htm">exequatur</a></em>; and his <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> Dominioni was also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>.

<p>Councils were held at Milan in 343 and 347, against Photinus; in the cause of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, at which the Emperor Constans menaced the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; 390, against <a href="../cathen/08530a.htm">Jovinian</a>; 451, against the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">Robber Council of Ephesus</a>; 680, against the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>; 1060, 1098, 1117, 1287, for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> and those of 1636 and of 1669 were also reform <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. Diocesan <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held in 1609 and 1850 respectively. The suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Milan were wont to meet each year at R&ograve;; their sees are <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a>, <a href="../cathen/04481b.htm">Crema</a>, <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, <a href="../cathen/09322b.htm">Lodi</a>, <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, and Pavia. The <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdiocese</a> has 788 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 1,828,000 inhabitants, 27 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, and of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> nearly 80 in the city and 220 throughout the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; it has 43 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> for boys and 176 for girls, 2 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> daily papers, and many important periodicals. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> there was a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Milan, St. Cosmas, for <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">Rule of St. Basil</a>; they depended, however, on a similar <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, and had no relation with <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. This order, which used the so-called Aquileian rite, was suppressed in 1650.
<h2>Religious edifices</h2>

<p>The wonderful Italian Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is built of white marble, has five <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, and is 486 feet in length; it is surmounted by 98 slender turrets, on the principal one of which is a bronze-gilt <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Madonna; there are, in all, 6000 <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, 2000 of which are on the exterior. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is situated on the site of the ancient basilica of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maggiore (fourth or fifth century), and was begun in 1386 by Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti. The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles</a> is under the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>. The treasury of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> contains, among other valuable objects, two <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles</a> and of St. Ambrose, made of silver and set with precious stones, the gift of the city. The <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is a gift of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Ambrose, built by its <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> in 386, and often restored, especially in the twelfth century, contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Emperor Louis II; in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Satyrus is a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> that dates, probably, from the fifth century, while the central door, with wood-carvings representing scenes from the life of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, is held, on seemingly good grounds, to be of the time of St. Ambrose; the church possesses also a golden altar-front (<em>palliotto</em>) of Angilbert (835). The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> annexed to this church had a fine <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and belonged at first to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, later to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>; it serves now as a military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Eustorgius contains the mausoleums of Stefano Visconti, Martino della Torre, and others. The church of St. Stefano Maggiore is of the fifth century; that of San Vittore <em>al corpo</em> is the Basilica Portiana, dating from before the time of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>; it contains the body of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> St. Victor, and also valuable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. San Nazaro Maggiore (382?) has a <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> by <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a>, and contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Trivulzio <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Aquilinus there is a beautiful <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> and the sarcophagus of a lady of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>. Santa Maria delle Grazie is a church in the style of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> (1465), with a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> by <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a>; it has valuable frescoes, beautiful carvings, and inlaid work in the choir; in the ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, is the famous Last Supper of <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. On the site of the principal hall of the baths of Maximiam, the peristyles of which remain, is built the church of San Lorenzo, containing ancient <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>. The church of San Marco (1254) has a beautiful <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, and valuable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>; that of San Maurizio, said to have been built by Queen Theodelinda, is covered with frescoes by <a href="../cathen/09419b.htm">Luini</a> between 1503 and 1509. San Satiro, a church that dates from 876, was restored by <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a>. There are also the church of the Holy Sepulchre, and others.
<h2>Secular edifices</h2>

<p>Among these are the Palazzo di Corte (1228), restored several times; whose garden contains the Royal Villa (1790); the Broletto Nuovo, from 1228 to 1786 the palace of the commune; the Palazzo della Ragione (1233); the Broletto (1413-24), at present containing public offices; the Collegio Elvetico, founded by <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, and now the seat of the Court of Assizes; the Vittorio Emanuele gallery and the Castello Sforzesco.

In the Castello Sforzesco is a museum of ancient and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> art, while many of the private palaces, such as those of the Borromeos and of the Trivulzios, contain valuable collections of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. The National Library in the Brera (1770) and the <a href="../cathen/01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a> are famous. The latter was founded by <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">Cardinal Federigo Borromeo</a> (1609) and contains 200,000 volumes, besides 8300 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, 126 of which are illuminated with miniatures. The State and the municipal archives are important; so, also, in their sphere, are the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> and the meteorological observatories.
