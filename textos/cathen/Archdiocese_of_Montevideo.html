<h1>Archdiocese of Montevideo</h1>  

<p>(MONTISVIDEI)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/15230c.htm">Uruguay</a>, comprises the whole of the republic. This territory was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Paraguayan Church till 1620, when it became subject to <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a>. In 1828 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> erected it into a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>. On 15 July, 1878, it was raised to episcopal rank, Mgr. Hyacinth Vera being first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; on 19 April, 1897, it was made an archdiocese. It was decided at that time to erect two suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, <a href="../cathen/10169a.htm">Melo</a> and Salt&oacute;, but no appointments have yet been made (1910). Since colonial days ended, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> at times, especially between 1880 and 1890 under Santos, who forbade religious under forty to make <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, instituted <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a>, and made it a crime to baptise a child before its birth was registered civilly. Today, however, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is flourishing, and the archdiocese contains many congregations of men (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, etc.), and over 300 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> engaged in teaching and charitable work. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains 72,210 square miles, and about 1,103,000 inhabitants (in 1906), almost all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, of whom 308,000 were in the Department of Montevideo. There are 46 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 7 filial cures, 122 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and about 100 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and churches. The present occupant of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is Mgr. Mariano Soler, born at San Carlo, <a href="../cathen/15230c.htm">Uruguay</a>, 25 March, 1846; elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 29 June, 1891; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, 19 April, 1897; he has two <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a>: Mgr. Ricardo Isasa (<a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01475c.htm">Anemurium</a>), born at Montevideo, 7 February, 1847; elected, 15 February, 1891; and Mgr. Pio Gaetano Secondo Stella (<a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Amizona), born at Paso del Molino, <a href="../cathen/15230c.htm">Uruguay</a>, 7 August, 1857; elected, 22 December, 1893. Almost all the inhabitants are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, there is, however, a small <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensian</a> agricultural colony in the East of <a href="../cathen/04125b.htm">Colonia</a>.

<p>Among the noteworthy buildings of the City of Montevideo may be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, begun in 1803, completed and restored in 1905; and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> churches. Within recent years conferences of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> have been established in all the city <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; likewise an excellent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> club; and an institute for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> working-men. The city dates back to early in the seventeenth century; a small fort, San Jos&eacute;, was built there in 1724; in January, 1728, the town was founded by Bruno de Zabala with the name San Felipe y Santiago; in 1807 it was captured by the British; in 1828 it became the capital of the republic; from 1842 to 1851 it withstood the nine years' siege by Oribe and his <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine</a> allies. Montevideo has within recent years grown to be one of the seven greatest seaports in the world (see <a href="../cathen/15230c.htm">URUGUAY</a>). San Jos&eacute; de Mayo (9000) contains a magnificent church, more massive than the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; and also the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the Sisters of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Huerto, which has a very pretty <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> attached. (For the early Uruguayan missions among the Indians see <a href="../cathen/12688b.htm">REDUCTIONS OF PARAGUAY</a>.)
