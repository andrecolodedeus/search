<h1>Archdiocese of New York</h1>  

<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK (NEO-EBORACENSIS).

<p>See erected 8 April, 1808; made <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> 19 July, 1850; comprises the Boroughs of Manhattan, Bronx, and Richmond in the City of New York, and the Counties of Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, York; also the Bahama Islands (British Possessions); an area of 4717 square miles in New York and 4466 in the Bahama Islands. The latter territory was placed in 1886 under this <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> because the facilities of access were best from New York; it formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Diocese of Charleston</a>. The suffragans of New York are the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, <a href="../cathen/11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a>, Rochester, and <a href="../cathen/14397a.htm">Syracuse</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>, and Newark and <a href="../cathen/15037a.htm">Trenton</a> in <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>. All these, in 1808, made up the territory of the original diocese. The first division took place 23 April, 1847, when the creation of the <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Diocese of Albany</a> and Buffalo cut off the northern and western sections of the State; and the second, in 1853, when Brooklyn and Newark were erected into separate <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>.

<p>New York is now the largest <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in population, and the most important in influence and material prosperity of all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">ecclesiastical divisions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Continental <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Colonial period</h2>

<p>Nearly a century before Henry Hudson sailed up the great river that bears his name, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> navigators <a href="../cathen/15364a.htm">Verrazano</a> and Gomez, had guided their ships along its shores and placed it under the patronage of St. Anthony. The <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> Hollanders, to whom Hudson gave this foundation for a new colony, manifested their loyalty to their state Church by ordaining that in New Netherlands the "Reformed Christian religion according to the doctrines of the Synod of Dordrecht" should be dominant. It is probable, but not certain, that there were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with <a href="../cathen/15364a.htm">Verrazano</a> and Gomez, and that from a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> altar went up the first <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> uttered on the site of the present great <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. While public worship by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was not tolerated, the generosity of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> governor, William Kieft, and the people of New Amsterdam to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Father <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Isaac Jogues</a>, in 1643, and after him, to his brother <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Fathers <a href="../cathen/02766a.htm">Bressani</a> and <a href="../cathen/09149a.htm">Le Moyne</a>, must be recognized to their everlasting credit. <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Father Jogues</a> was the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to traverse the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>; the first to minister within the limits of the Diocese of New York. When he reached Manhattan Island, after his rescue from captivity in the summer of 1643, he found there two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, a young Irishman and a Portuguese <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whose confessions he heard.

<p>St. Mary's, the first rude <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in which Mass was said in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>, was begun, on 18 November, 1655, on the banks of the lake where the <a href="../cathen/14397a.htm">City of Syracuse</a> now stands, by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries, Fathers <a href="../cathen/04601a.htm">Claude Dablon</a> and <a href="../cathen/03645a.htm">Pierre Chaumonot</a>. In the same year another <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/09149a.htm">Father Simon Le Moyne</a>, journeyed down the river to New Amsterdam, as we learn from a letter sent by the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> preacher, Megapolensis (a renegade <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>), to the Classis at <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, telling them that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> had visited Manhattan "on account of the Papists residing here, and especially for the accommodation of the French sailors, who are Papists and who have arrived here with a good prize." The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had no foothold on Manhattan Island until after 1664, when the Duke of York claimed it for an English colony. Twenty years later, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> governor, <a href="../cathen/05130a.htm">Thomas Dongan</a>, not only fostered his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but enacted the first law passed in New York establishing religious liberty. It is believed that the first Mass said on the island (30 October, 1683) was in a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> he opened about where the custom house now stands. With him came three <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Fathers Thomas Harvey, Henry Harrison, and Charles Gage, and they soon had a Latin <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the same neighborhood. Of this Jacob Leisler, the fanatical usurper of the government, wrote to the Governor of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, in August, 1689: "I have formerly urged to inform your Honr. that <a href="../cathen/05130a.htm">Coll Dongan</a>, in his time did erect a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuite</a> Colledge upon cullour to learn Latine to the Judges West &#151; Mr. Graham, Judge Palmer, and John Tudor did contribute their sones for sometime but no boddy imitating them, the colledge vanished" (O'Callaghan, "Documentary Hist. of N.Y.", II, 23).

<p>With the fall of James II and the advent of William of Orange to the English throne, New York's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colony was almost stamped out by drastic <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> (see <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">S<font size=-2>TATE OF</font> N<font size=-2>EW</font> Y<font size=-2>ORK</font></a>). In spite of them, however, during the years that followed a few scattered representatives of the Faith drifted in and settled down unobtrusively. To minister to them there came now and then from Philadelphia a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, <a href="../cathen/14285b.htm">Father Ferdinand Steinmayer</a>, who was commonly called "Father Farmer". Gathering them together, he said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the house of a German fellow-countryman in Wall Street, in a loft in Water Street, and wherever else they could find accommodation. Then came the Revolution, and in this connexion, owing to one of the prominent political issues of the time, the spirit of the leading colonists was intensely anti-Catholic. The first flag raised by the Sons of Liberty in New York was inscribed "No Popery". When the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> ended, and the president and Congress resided in New York, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> representatives of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, with Charles Carroll, his cousin Daniel, and Thomas Fitz Simmons, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> members of Congress, and officers and soldiers of the foreign contingent, merchants and others, soon made up a respectable congregation. Mass was said for them in the house of the Spanish minister, Don Diego de Gardoqui, on Broadway, near the Bowling Green, in the Vauxhall Gardens, which was a hall on the river front near Warren Street, and in a carpenter's shop in Barclay Street. Finally, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, Father Charles Whelan, who had served as a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> consul-general, Don Jos&eacute; Roiz Silva, took up also the care of this scattered flock, which numbered less than two hundred, and only about forty of them practical in the observances of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.



<p>Through efforts led by the French consul, <a href="../cathen/04488b.htm">Hector St. John de Cr&egrave;vecoeur</a>, an act of incorporation was secured, on 10 June, 1785, for the "Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church of the City of New York," in which Jos&eacute; Roiz Silva, James Stewart, and Henry Duffin were associated with him as the first board. An unexpired lease of lots at Barclay and Church streets was bought from the trustees of Trinity church, Thomas Stoughton, the Spanish Consul-general, and his partner Dominick Lynch, advancing the purchase money, one thousand pounds, and there on 5 Oct., 1785, the cornerstone of St. Peter's, the first permanent structure for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church erected in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>, was laid by the Spanish minister, Gardoqui. The church was opened 4 Nov., 1786. The first resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> was Father Whelan, who, however, was forced to retire owing to the hostility of the trustees and of another <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, the Rev. Andrew Nugent, before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was opened. The <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>, the venerable John Carroll, then visited New York to administer confirmation for the first time, and placed the church in charge of a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Father William O'Brien, who may be regarded as the organizer of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. He had as his assistants Fathers John Connell and Nicholas Burke, and, in his efforts to aid the establishment of the church, went as far as the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">City of Mexico</a> to collect funds there under the auspices of his old schoolfellow, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. He brought back $5920 and a number of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, vestments, etc. Father O'Brien and his assistants did heroic work during the yellow fever epidemics of 1795, 1799, 1801, and 1805. In 1801 he established the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which has since been carried on without interruption. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> at this time was $6500; the income from pew rents, $1120, and from collections, $360, a year. The Rev. Dr. Matthew O'Brien, another <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, the Rev. John Byrne, and the Rev. Michael Hurley, an Augustinian, were, during this period, assistants at St. Peter's. In July, 1807, the Rev. Louis Sibourd, a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, but he left in the following year, and then the famous <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/08686c.htm">Anthony Kohlman</a>, was sent to take charge. It was at this time that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> determined to erect Baltimore into an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> and to establish the new Dioceses of New York, Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, and Bardstown, Kentucky.
<h2 id="section2">Creation of the diocese</h2>

<p>We have a picture of the situation in New York when the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was named: a letter sent on 8 Nov., 1808, by Father Kohlmann, who was then acting as the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, to his friend Father Strickland, S.J., of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, says, "Your favour of the 6th Sept. was delivered to me at the beginning of October in the City of New York, where our Right Rev. Bishop Carroll has thought proper to send me in the capacity of <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of this immense congregation and Vicar General of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> till the arrival of the Right Rev. Richard Luke Concanen, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New York. The congregation chiefly consists of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, some hundreds of French, and as many Germans, in all according to the common estimation, of 14,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Rev. Mr. Fenwick, a young Father of our <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, distinguished for his learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, has been sent along with me. I was no sooner arrived in the city and, behold, the trustees, though before our arrival they had not spent a cent for the reparation and furniture of their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman's</a> house, laid out for the said purpose above $800. All men seem to revive at the very name of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, though yet little known in this part of the country." What rapid progress was made, he indicates, two years later, when, again writing to Father Strickland, on 14 Sept., 1810, he tells him: "Indeed it is but two years that we arrived in this city without having a cent in our pocket, not even our passage money, which the trustees paid for Father Fenwick and me . . . and to see things so far advanced as to see not only the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion highly respected by the first characters of the city, but even a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college established, the house well furnished both in town and in the college improvements made in the college (sic) for four or five hundred dollars . . . is a thing which I am at a loss to conceive and which I cannot ascribe but to the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> liberality of the Lord, to whom alone, therefore, be all glory and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The college is in the centre not of Long Island but of the Island of New York, the most delightful and most healthy spot of the whole island, at a distance of four small miles from the city, and of half a mile from the East and North rivers, both of which are seen from the house; situated between two roads which are very much frequented, opposite to the botanic gardens which belong to the State. It has adjacent to it a beautiful lawn, garden, orchard, etc." This spot is now the site of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth avenue.

<p>We can judge from the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> names on the register of St. Peter's church that the early <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of New York were largely <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>; next in number come the French, then the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, followed by those of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, Spanish and English origin. There were enough Germans in 1808 to think themselves entitled to a church and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of their own nationality, for on 2 March of that year Christopher Briehill, John Kneringer, George Jacob, Martin Nieder, and Francis Werneken signed a petition which they sent to Bishop Carroll praying him "to send us a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> who is capable of undertaking the spiritual Care of our Souls in the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German Language</a>, which is our Mother Tongue. Many of us do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> any English at all, and these who have some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it are not well enough versed in the English Language as to attend Divine Service with any utility to themselves. As we have not yet a place of worship of our own, we have made application to the Trustees of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this city to grant us permission to perform our worship in the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German Language</a> in their church at such times as not to interfere with their regular services. This permission they have readily granted us. During the Course of the year we shall take care to find an opportunity to provide ourselves with a suitable building of our own, for we have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that our number will soon considerably increase." Nothing came of this petition, and no separate German congregation was organized in New York until a quarter of a century after its date. But Father Kohlmann saw to it that another church should be started, and St. Patrick's was begun "between the Broadway and the Bowery road" in 1809, to meet the needs of the rapidly increasing number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on the east side of the city. It was also to serve as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of the new diocese. The <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> was laid 8 June, 1809, but, owing to the hard times and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1812 with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the structure was not ready for use until May, 1815, when it was dedicated by Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> who came from <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> for that purpose. It was then far on the outskirts of the city, and, to accustom the people to go there, Mass was said at St. Peter's every other Sunday. The ground on which it was built was purchased in 1801 for a graveyard, and the interments in it from that time until the cemetery was closed in 1833 numbered 32,153. Some of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> prominent during this period were Andrew Morris, Matthew Reed, <a href="../cathen/07190a.htm">Cornelius Heeney</a>, Thomas Stoughton, Dominick Lynch, Benjamin Disobrey, Peter Burtsell, uncle of the Rev. James A. Neil, the first native of New York to be admitted to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, Joseph Icard, merchant and architect, Hugh McGinnis, Dennis Doyle, Miles F. Clossey, Anthony Trapanni, a native of Meta, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, pioneer Italian merchant and the first foreigner to be naturalized under the Constitution, Francis Varet, John B. Lasala, Francis Cooper, George Gottsberger, Thomas O'Connor, Thomas Brady, Dr. William James Maneven, and <a href="../cathen/05135c.htm">Bernard Dornin</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publisher, for whose edition of Pastorini's "History of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>," issued in 1807, there were 318 New York City subscribers.
<h2 id="section3">The hierarchy</h2>
<h3>A</h3>

<p>When Bishop Carroll learned that it was the intention of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to recognize the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the United states by dividing the <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Diocese of Baltimore</a> and creating new sees, he advised that New York be placed under the care of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> till a suitable choice could be made for that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Archbishop Troy of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, however, induced <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> to appoint as New York's first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Father Richard Luke Concanen, who had resided many years in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the agent of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and was much esteemed there. He was <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of St. Clement's at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, librarian of the Minerva, and distinguished for his learning. He had refused a <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> for a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and was much interested in the missions in America, about which he had kept up a correspondence with Bishop Carroll. It was at his suggestion that Father Fenwick founded the first house of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New York at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 24 April, 1808, and some time after left for Leghorn on his way to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, taking with him the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> for Archbishop Carroll. After waiting there for a ship for four months he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Thence he went to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, expecting to sail from that port, but the French military forces in possession of the city detained him as a British subject, and, while waiting vainly to be released, he died of fever, 19 June, 1810. Finding that he could not leave <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he had asked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to appoint the Rev. Ambrose Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal to be his coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in New York. The American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cordially endorsed this choice and considered that the appointment would be made. Archbishop Carroll, writing to <a href="../cathen/12167a.htm">Father C. Plowden</a>, of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 25 June, 1815, said: "It was known here that before the death of Dr. Concanen his Holiness at the Dr's entreaty intended to assign him as his coadjutor the Rev. Mr. Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Sulpice, now in the Seminary here, and worthy of any promotion in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. We still expected that this measure would be pursued; and that we made no presentation or recommendation of any other for the vacant see."

<p>Archbishop Troy, of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, however, with the other <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, proposed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> another <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04257a.htm">Rev. John Connolly</a>, for the vacant see of New York, and he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 6 Nov., 1814. It was a selection which might have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> embarrassing to American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, for <a href="../cathen/04257a.htm">Bishop Connolly</a> was a British subject, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was then at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Great Britain. "I wish," wrote Archbishop Carroll to <a href="../cathen/12167a.htm">Father Plowden</a>, 25 June, 1815, "this may not become a very dangerous precedent fruitful of mischief by drawing upon our religion a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinion of the servility of our principles." Owing to his own views of the situation in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <a href="../cathen/04257a.htm">Bishop Connolly</a> did not announce his appointment to his fellow-members of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> or to the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Father Kohlmann was, therefore, in anticipation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> arrival, recalled by his superiors to <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was closed, and the other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> soon after left the diocese. Finally, <a href="../cathen/04257a.htm">Bishop Connolly</a> arrived in New York unannounced, and without any formal local welcome, 24 Nov., 1815, his ship taking sixty-eight days to make the voyage from <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. In the diocese he found that everything was to be created from resources that were very small and in spite of obstacles that were very great. The diocese embraced the whole <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a> and half of <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>. There were but four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in this territory. Lay trustees had become so accustomed to having their own way that they were not disposed to admit even the authority of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/04257a.htm">Dr. Connolly</a> was not wanting in firmness, but the pressing needs of the times, forcing an apparent concession to the established order of things, subjected him to much difficulty and many humiliations. He was a missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> rather than a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as he wrote <a href="../cathen/09293a.htm">Cardinal Litta</a>, Prefect of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, in February, 1818, but he discharged all his laborious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and earnest <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. His diary further notes that he told the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>: "I found here about 13,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> . . . At present there are about 16,000 mostly <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>; at least 10,000 <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> arrived at New York only within these last three years. They spread through all the other states of this confederacy, and make their religion known everywhere. Bishops ought to be granted to whatever here is willing to erect a Cathedral, and petition for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> . . . The present <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are quite too extensive. This burden hinders us from supporting a sufficient number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or from thinking to erect a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The American youth have an invincible repugnance to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>."

<p>He made a visitation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, no mean accomplishment at that time; provided churches for the people in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, and Paterson; introduced the Sisters of Charity, started the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, and encouraged the opening of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. He died at his residence, 512 Broadway, 5 Feb., 1825, worn out by is labours and anxieties. Notable men of this period were Fathers Michael O'Gorman and Richard Bulger &#151; the latter the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in New York (1820) &#151; Charles D. Ffrench, John Power, John Farnan, Thomas C. Levins, Philip Larisey and John Shannahan. There were several distinguished converts, including Mother Seton, founder of the American branch of the Sisters of Charity; the Rev. Virgil Barber and his wife, the Rev. George E. Ironside, Keating Lawson, and others. Two years elapsed before the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was appointed, and the Rev. Dr. John Power during that period governed the diocese as administrator. Brooklyn's first church was organized during this time. It was during <a href="../cathen/04257a.htm">Bishop Connolly's</a> administration also, that New York's first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper "The Truth Teller" was started, on 2 April, 1825.
<h3>C</h3>

<p>The choice of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the <a href="../cathen/05178b.htm">Rev. Dr. John Dubois</a>, president of Mount St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg and he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 29 October, 1826. The Rev. William Taylor, a convert who had come from <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in June, 1818, at the suggestion of <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Bishop England</a> of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, endeavoured to be himself made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, going to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in January, 1820, for that purpose. The visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> being fruitless, Taylor went to <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, where he remained several years with Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a>, returning to New York when that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was transferred to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was exceedingly popular with non-Catholics because of his liberality. He preached the sermon at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Bishop Dubois and used the occasion to expatiate on what he called "disastrous experiences which resulted to religion from injudicious appointments", hinting at coming trouble for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in New York. He left New York simultaneously with the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> there, and sailed for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where his old friend Mgr. <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a>, then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, received him. He died suddenly, while preaching in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> college, Paris, in 1828.

<p>None of the predicted disturbances happened when Bishop Dubois took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, though the abuse of trusteeism, grown more and more insolent and unmanageable by toleration, hampered his efforts from the very start. Fanaticism was aroused among the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, alarmed at the numerical increase of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through the immigration attracted by the commercial growth of the State. But in spite of all, he went on <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> visiting all parts of the State, building and encouraging the building of churches wherever they were needed, obtaining aid from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and from the charitable in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He found but two churches in the city when he came; to these he added six others and multiplied for his flock the facilities for practising their religion, his constant endeavour being to give his people <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. With the trustees in New York City and in Buffalo he had many sad experiences, but he unflinchingly upheld his constituted authority. In 1834 he organized, with the Rev. John Raffeiner as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, the first German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation in New York in a small disused <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptist</a> church at Pitt and De Lancey Streets, which became the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nicholas. It was about this time, too, that a public controversy over <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> raged between the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, Rev. John Breckenridge and Rev. William Brownlee, and the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Rev. Dr. Power, assisted by Fathers Varela, Levins, and Schneller. It was followed by the fanatical attack on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities known as "The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk". Dr. Dubois "had then reached the age of seventy and, though still a vigorous combatant when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, was disinclined to religious controversy. Perhaps he did not understand the country and the people as well as the younger men who had grown up in America; perhaps he was deterred by his memories of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>" (Hebermann, "His. Records and Studies", I, Pt. 2, 333).

<p>At length the many burdens and anxieties of his charge told on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and he asked for a coadjutor, naming the <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Right Rev. P.F. Kenrick</a>, Coadjutor of Philadelphia, as his first choice, and the Rev. Thomas F. Mulledy, S.J., and the <a href="../cathen/07516a.htm">Rev. John Hughes</a>, of Philadelphia, as alternates. Father Hughes, of Philadelphia, who had been his pupil at Emmitsburg, was selected and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basileo, 7 January, 1838. His youth and vigour soon put new life into the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in New York, and were especially efficient in meeting the aggressions of the lay trustees. Bishop Hughes had fully realized the dangers of the system as shown in Philadelphia, and he lost no time in meeting and crushing it in New York. Bishop Dubois, through ill health, had to relinquish the details of his charge more and more to his youthful assistant, whose activity he warmly welcomed. Several attacks of paralysis warned him to give up the management of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. His remaining days he spent quietly preparing for the end, his coadjutor ever treating him with respectful kindness and sympathy. He died 20 December, 1840, full of years and merits. Those of his assistants who were notably prominent were Father Felix Varela, an eminently <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and versatile <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, an exile from <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, and the Revs. Joseph Schneller, <a href="../cathen/12116a.htm">Dr. Constantine C. Pise</a>, Alexander Mupietti, John Raffeiner, the pioneer German <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>; Hatton Walsh, P. Malou, T. Maguire, Michael Curran, Gregory B. Pardow, Luke Berry, John N. Neumann, later a <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia, and John Walsh, long <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. James, Brooklyn.

<p><a href="../cathen/07516a.htm">Bishop Hughes</a>, the administrator, at once assumed the title of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> as its fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and is the really great figure in the constructive period of New York's history. "It was a day of great men in the civil order", says the historian, Dr. John Gilmary Shea, "the day of Clay, Webster, Calhoun, yet no man of that era spoke so directly or so effectively to the American people as Bishop Hughes. He was not an ordinary man. It had been well said that in any assemblage he would have been notable. He was full of noble thoughts and aspirations and devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; every plan and every project of his mind aimed at the greater good of the country". The story of his eventful career is told in a <a href="../cathen/07516a.htm">separate article</a>, and it will suffice to mention here some of the many distinguished men who helped to make his administration so important in local records. Among them were the Rev. William Quarter, afterwards first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, and his brother, the Rev. Bernard O'Reilly, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>; the Rev. John Loughlin, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>; the Rev. James R. Bayley, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02191a.htm">Rev. David Bacon</a>, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>; the Rev. William G. McCloskey, first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the American College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, Ky., son of one of the Brooklyn pioneers; the Rev. Andrew Byrne, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09295a.htm">Little Rock</a>; the Rev. John J. Conroy, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>; the Rev. William Starrs, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>; the Rev. Dr. Ambrose Manahan, the Rev. John Kelley (Eugene Kelly's brother), who went as a missionary to Africa and then became first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Jersey City. These are only a few of the names that are prominent. Among the notable converts of this period may be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/12402b.htm">Rev. Thomas S. Preston</a>, <a href="../cathen/07564a.htm">J.V. Huntington</a>, F.E. White, Donald McLeod, <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Isaac T. Hecker</a>, <a href="../cathen/07309b.htm">A.F. Hewit</a>, Alfred Young, Clarence Walworth, and Edgar P. Wadhams, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a>.
<h3>E</h3>

<p>As the successor of Archbishop Hughes, Bishop John McCloskey of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a> was promoted to be the second <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. He had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Coadjutor of New York, with the right of succession, in 1844, but resigned both offices to become the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a> in 1847 (see JOHN MCCLOSKEY). He returned to New York in spite of his own protests of unworthiness, but with the unanimous approval and rejoicing of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. He was born in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, 10 March, 1810, and was therefore the first native <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as he was the second native of New York to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He was a gentle, polished, amiable <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, and accomplished much for the progress of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> New York. The Protectory, the Founding Asylum, and the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin for homeless children were founded under his auspices; he resumed work on the new Cathedral, and saw its completion; the provincial <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Troy was organized; <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> were everywhere increased and improved. In the stimulation of a general appreciation of the necessity of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (he was elevated to the Purple in 1875) was incessant and most vigorous. He saw that the foundations of the structure, laid deep by his illustrious predecessor, upheld an edifice in which all the requirements of modern <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> methods should be found. Like him, also, as years crept on, he asked for a coadjutor, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Michael Augustine Corrigan</a>, was sent to him.
<h3>F</h3>

<p>Born in Newark, 31 August, 1839, his college days were spent at Mt. St. Mary's, Emmitsburg, and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> in 1863, <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Bishop Corrigan</a> became president of Seton Hall College in 1868, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a> in 1873, Coadjutor of New York in 1880, and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in 1885. He died, from an accidental fall during the building of the Lady Chapel at the Cathedral, 5 May, 1902. It was said of him by the New York "Evening Post": "The memory of his life distills a fragrance like to that of St. Francis." By some New Yorkers he was for a time a much misunderstood man, whose memory time will vindicate. Acute thinkers are appreciating his worth as a civilian as well as a churchman, and the fact that, for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, he grappled with the first menacing move of Socialism and effectually and permanently checked its advance. He was an administrator of ability and, socially, a man of winning <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. To the serious problem of providing for the spiritual need of the inrushing thousands of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> immigrants he gave successful consideration. The splendid <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Dunwoodie is his best memorial. Its beautiful <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> he built at a cost of $60,000 &#151; his whole private inherited fortune. During his administration controversy over the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> question was waged with a certain amount of acrimony. He was regarded as the leader of those all over the country who stood for uncompromising <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a> was also drawn into conflict with the Rev. Dr. Edward McGlynn, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Stephen's church, a man of considerable ability, but whose radical views on the ownership of land had brought on him the official censure of Cardinal Simeoni, Prefect of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. In the municipal election of 1886, in spite of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> warnings, he became the open partisan of Henry George who was the candidate for mayor of the Single Tax Party. As a consequence, he was suspended, and, as an alumnus of the College of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to answer the charges made against him. He refused to go and was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. &#151; For details and text of official letters, see <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan's</a> statement to New York papers (21 January, 1887) and Dr. McGlynn's formal answer in Henry George's "Standard" (5 February, 1887). &#151; Dr. McGlynn's partisans organized themselves into what they called the Anti-Poverty Society. He addressed this body every <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> until about <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1892, when, having willingly accepted the conditions laid down by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he was absolved from censure and reconciled by <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Mgr. Satolli</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a>. According to a published statement by <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Mgr. Satolli</a>, the conditions were in this form: "Dr. McGlynn had presented a brief statement of his opinions on moral-economic matters, and it was judged not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> constantly taught by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and as recently confirmed by the Holy Father in the encyclical 'Rerum Novarum'. Also it is hereby made known that Dr. McGlynn, besides publicly professing his adherence to all the doctrines and teachings of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has expressed regret (saying that he would be the first to regret it) for any word or act of his that may have seemed lacking in the respect due to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, and he hereby intends to repair as far as he can any offense which may have been given to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Finally, Dr. McGlynn has of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> declared and promised that, within the limits of a not long period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, he will go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the spirit and intention which are becoming to a good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>." In 1894 Dr. McGlynn was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Mary's church, Newburg, where he remained quietly until his death in 1901.

<p><a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a> made his last visit ad limina in 1890 and after his return, until his death in 1902, devoted himself entirely to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his high office. His death brought out the fact that he was the foremost figure of the community in the respect and affection of his fellow-citizens. His unassuming <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and his gentle method, his considerate kindness and his unaffected <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> were pathways t the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and veneration of his flock. His steadfast adherence to principle, as well as his persuasive manner of, not only teaching, but also of acting out the doctrines of his religion, his profound scholarship, his experienced judgment, were ever employed when there was a question of a religious, moral, or civil import to his fellow-men. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this is to be found in the testimony of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, himself, of the civil dignitaries of the land, of his brethren in the episcopate, of his own <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, on the mournful occasion of his death. Under the second and third <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, Mgr William Quinn, V.G., was a prominent figure, and among his associates of this era were <a href="../cathen/12402b.htm">Mgr Thomas S. Preston</a>, Mgr Arthur J. Donnelly, Mgr James McMahon, Mgr P. F. McSweeny, Fathers Farrelly, Eugene McGuire, Thomas Farrell, Edward J. O'Reilly, M.J. O'Farrell, (later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15037a.htm">Trenton</a>), and Edmund Aubril.
<h3>G</h3>

<p>As fourth <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> confirmed the choice of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> electors, and appointed to fill the vacancy the auxiliary, the Right Rev. John Murphy Farley, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15757b.htm">Zeugma</a>, who was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> 15 September, 1902. He was born at Newton Hamilton, County Armagh, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 20 April, 1842. His primary studies were made at St. McCartan's College, Monaghan, and, on his coming to New York, were continued at St. John's College, <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>. Thence he went to the provincial <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Troy for his philosophy course, and after this to the American College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 11 June, 1870. Returning to New York, he ministered as an assistant in St. Peter's <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, Staten Island, for two years, and in 1872 was appointed secretary to the then Archbishop McCloskey, in which office he served until 1884, when he was made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Gabriel's church, New York City. He accompanied the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1878, for the election of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, which event, however, took place before their arrival. In 1884 he was made a private chamberlain; in 1892 he was promoted to the domestic prelacy, and in 1895 to be prothonotary apostolic. In 1891 he was chosen <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>, and, on 21 December, 1895, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as his auxiliary, with the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15757b.htm">Zeugma</a>. At the death of <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>, he was appointed his successor, 15 Sept., 1902, and <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> named him assistant at the pontifical throne in 1904. He made progress in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the diocese the keynote of his administration, and within the first eight years added nearly fifty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> to the primary list, encouraged the increase also of high schools and founded Cathedral College as a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.

<p>In the proceedings of the annual convention of the <a href="../cathen/05305a.htm">Catholic Educational Association</a> held in New York in 1903, and of the National Eucharistic Congress in 1904, Archbishop Farley took a most active and directive part. Synods were held regularly every third year, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conferences quarterly, to give effect to every instruction and legislative act of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. A monthly recollection for all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> assembled together was instituted. Provision was made for the religious needs of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> and other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigrants &#151; the Italian portion of his flock numbering about 400,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The great work of issuing T<font size=-2>HE</font> C<font size=-2>ATHOLIC</font> E<font size=-2>NCYCLOPEDIA</font> owed its inception and progress to his help and stimulus. The centenary of the erection of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was celebrated under his direction by a magnificent festival lasting a week (April 27-May 2, 1908); the Lady Chapel of the Cathedral was completed, the Cathedral <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> was paid off, and the edifice <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 5 October, 1910, Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to the Twenty-first Eucharistic Congress, Cardinal Logue, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of All <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, Cardinal Gibbons of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 70 <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, 1000 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and an immense congregation of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> being present at the Mass of the day. Archbishop Farley was given an auxiliary in the Right Rev. Thomas F. Cusack, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14566b.htm">Themiscyra</a>, 25 April, 1904. Bishop Cusack was born in New York, 22 Feb., 1862, and made his classical course at <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> College where he graduated in 1880. His <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies were pursued at the provincial <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, Troy, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1865. He was a very successful director of the Diocesan-Apostolate (1897-1904) before his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, after which he was appointed Rector of St. Stephen's parish.

<h3>The cathedral</h3>

<p>St. Patrick's Cathedral, standing on the crest of New York's most magnificent thoroughfare, is the noblest temple ever dedicated, in any land, to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Apostle of Ireland</a>. It is an edifice of which every citizen of the great <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> is justly proud. Its style is the decorated and geometric Gothic of which the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and Cologne are prominent examples. It was planned in 1853 by James Renwick of New York; construction was begun in 1858, and the building was formally opened and dedicated on 25 May, 1879 (building operations having been suspended, owing to the Civil War, from 1861-66). The site of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the block bounded by Fifth Avenue, Fiftieth Street, Fourth Avenue, and Fifty-first Street, has been in the possession of the church authorities, and used for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> purposes, except during a very brief interval (1821-1828), since 1 March, 1810. The block on which the Cathedral stands was purchased at its then marketable value and therefore never was a gift or donation of the city, as has been said sometimes, either ignorantly or even with conscious malice. The <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> was laid on the afternoon of Sunday, 15 August, 1858, by Archbishop Hughes, in the presence of an assemblage estimated at one hundred thousand. The address delivered by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is regarded as one of the most eloquent and memorable ever uttered. The gathering may be considered the first public manifestation of that great <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> New York which became the wonder and admiration of the nineteenth century, and it lent inspiration and power to the magic of his ringing words of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and triumph.

<p>St. Patrick's Cathedral is the eleventh in size among the great churches of the world. Its dimensions are as follows, the Lady Chapel excluded: Exterior:--Extreme length (with Lady Chapel), 398 feet; extreme breadth, 174 feet; general breadth, 132 feet; towers at base, 32 feet; height of towers, 330 feet. Interior:--Length, 370 feet; breadth of <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and choir (including <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>), 120 feet; length of <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, 140 feet; central aisle, 48 feet wide, 112 feet high; side <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, 24 feet wide, 54 feet high; <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> 18 feet wide, 14 feet high, 12 feet deep. the foundations are of very large blocks of gneiss, which were laid in cement mortar up to the level of the surface. Above the ground-line, the first base-course is of granite, as is also the first course under all the columns and marble works of the interior. Above this base-course the whole exterior of the building is of white marble. The cost of the building was about four million dollars. In the original plan there was an apsidal Lady Chapel, but work on this was not begun until 20 July, 1901, during the administration of <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>. It was finished by Archbishop Farley in 1906. The architect was Charles T. Mathews whose design was thirteenth-century French Gothic. This <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> is 56.5 feet long by 28 feet wide and 56 feet high. The building of the Lady Chapel was started by a memorial gift for that purpose from the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Eugene Kelly, the banker, who died in New York, 19 Dec., 1894. Eugene Kelly was born in County Tyrone, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 25 Nov., 1808, and <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to New York in 1834. Here he engaged in the drygoods business, and later at St. Louis, Mo., whence he went to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> in 1850 during the gold excitement. As a banker and merchant there, he amassed a considerable fortune the interests of which took him back to New York to live in 1856. He was a trustee of the Cathedral for several terms and identified with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charitable, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, and social movements of the city. In the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> the deceased <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> are buried and the vault of the Kelly <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is at the rear of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> under the Chapel.
<h3>Education</h3>

<p>In the cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> the Diocese of New York can claim the proud distinction of being the pioneer, the unceasing and uncompromising advocate. In 1685 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> Harvey and Harrison began the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institution</a> in the state; the New York Latin School, which stood near the present site of Trinity Church, Wall Street and Broadway, and was attended by the sons of the most influential colonial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was closed by the fanatical intolerance which followed the <a href="../cathen/05130a.htm">Dongan</a> administration in 1638. In 1801, Father Matthew O'Brien, O.P., <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Peter's church, opened the free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> which has been carried on ever since without interruption. During the first five years it was supported entirely by the people of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, but in 1806 the legislature of the state, by an act passed 21 March, placed the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> on the same footing as those of other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denominations</a> in the city; all of them received its share of the public money. After St. Patrick's church was commenced, Father Kohlmann, S.J. began the New York Literary Institution, the first collegiate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, in a house on Mott Street, opposite the church. It was an immediate success, and was soon removed to a house on Broadway, and then, in March, 1812, to a suburban site in the village of Elgin, now Fiftieth Street and Fifth Avenue, the site of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Although well patronized by the best <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the city, the inability of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> community to keep up the teaching staff forced the abandonment of the enterprise in 1815. to supply teachers for girls, Father Kohlmann secured several <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Nuns from <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, who arrived in the city 9 April, 1812. Their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was located near the Literary Institution, and the Legislature, by the Act of 25 March, 1814, incorporated "The Ursuline Convent of the City of New York", by which "Christine Fagan, Sarah Walsh, Mary Baldwin and others are incorporated for the purpose of teaching poor children". After a year, as no other subjects joined their community, and they were no satisfied with the location, which was too remote from the city for them to receive daily <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> from a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, these <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> gave up the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.

<p>With the advent of <a href="../cathen/04257a.htm">Bishop Connolly</a> to the diocese (24 November, 1815) St. Patrick's <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was opened in the basement of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The "Catholic Almanac" for 1822 relates that "there are in this city two extensive <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> conducted upon a judicious plan and supported partly by the funds of the State and partly by moneys raised twice a year by the two congregations". The report of the trustees of St. Peter's church to the superintendent of common <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, in 1824, states that the average number of scholars in St. Peter's and St. Patrick's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> from their opening had been about 500 each. These two were the pioneer <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of that great <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> system of free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> throughout the diocese which has been the example and stimulus for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> all over the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. On 28 June, 1817, three Sisters of Charity, sent to her native city by Mother Seton, arrived in New York from Emmitsburg to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Patrick's church. In 1830 these Sisters of Charity took charge of St. Peter's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and opened two academies. In 1816, owing to the conflict between the French rule of their institute, forbidding the care of boys, and other details of discipline which greatly interfered with <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> progress, Bishop Hughes received permission to organize an independent community with <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> autonomy. This was established 8 December, 1846, with the election of Mother Elizabeth Boyle as the first superior. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was opened at 35 East Broadway, but in 1847 was moved to Fifth Avenue and One Hundred and Fifth Street, where the academy for girls and mother-house of Mount St. Vincent was established. Ten years later the city took this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> for Central Park, and the community moved to the banks of the Hudson, just below Yonkers, where the College of Mount St. Vincent, and the headquarters of the community now are. There are about eighteen hundred of these sisters teaching in more than sixty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and in charge of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institutions.

<p>In 1841 a community of the Religious of the Sacred Heart was sent to the diocese by <a href="../cathen/02283a.htm">Mother Barat</a>, and established their first <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Houston and Mulberry Streets. A year later this was moved to Astoria, Long Island, and in 1846 to the present site of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Manhattanville, where, under the direction, for many years, of the famous <a href="../cathen/07134b.htm">Mother Mary Aloysia Hardey</a>, it became, not only a popular <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institution</a> but the centre whence radiated most of the progress made by the Institute throughout the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. When the first Religious of the Sacred Heart arrived in New York, 31 July, 1827, on their way from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to make the first foundation in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> at St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, Bishop Dubois was most favourably impressed by them, and wished to have a community for New York also. A letter which he wrote to <a href="../cathen/02283a.htm">Mother Barat</a> in the following October expresses this desire and gives a view of his charge at that time. "It was my intention", he says, "to visit you and your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> associates in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in order to give you a better <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of our country before asking you to establish a house in New York. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the success of an order like yours in this city; indeed it is greatly needed; but a considerable sum of money would be required to supply the urgent needs of the foundation. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, which averages over thirty thousand <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, is very poor, besides chiefly composed of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> emigrants. Contributions from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> are so uncertain and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in this city so expensive that I cannot promise any assistance. All I can say is that I believe one of your <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, commenced with sufficient money to purchase <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and support itself until the ladies have time to make themselves known, would succeed beyond all our expectations....I have the sorrow of witnessing an abundant harvest rotting in the earth, through lack of Apostolic labourers and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> funds to organize the various needs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>." Although Bishop Dubois was not able to accomplish his desire to have a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> then established, his prophecy as to its success when it was opened was amply justified by subsequent results.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a>, School Sisters of Notre Dame, and other teaching communities followed in the course of the succeeding years, until now (1910) the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the archdiocese are in charge of twenty-six different <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, twenty-two of Sisters and four of Brothers. In 1829 an Irishman named James D. Boylan with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of Bishop Dubois attempted to establish a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community on the lines of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Brothers of Charity to teach the boys' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and opened two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The attempt failed in the course of the year, owing to want of business tact and the inimical spirit of trusteeism. The <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> opened their first <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in New York in September, 1848, in <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, at 16 East Canal Street. La Salle Academy was opened in Canal Street in 1850, moved to Mulberry Street in 1856 and East Second Street in 1857. Manhattan College was opened in 1853. These Brothers have charge also of the De La Salle Institute, the Classon Point Military Academy, twenty-six <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and the great <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Protectory. Bishop Hughes, in 1846, invited the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to return to the diocese and take charge of St. John's College and Seminary at <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>, which he had opened there in the old Rose Hill manor house, 24 June, 1841. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was moved to Troy in 1864, and St. John's remained as part of <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham University</a>. <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> College was begun at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the church of the Holy Name of Jesus, Elizabeth Street, and finally located in West Sixteenth Street in 1850. Loyola School was opened by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1899 at Park Avenue and Fifty-third street.

<p>As has been said, the state appropriation for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was divided at first among all <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Public <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in New York, at the opening of the nineteenth century, was denominational, and under the direction of the Public School Society organized in 1805 "to provide a free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of poor children in the city who do not belong to, or are not provided for by any <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denomination</a>". In 1808 the name was changed to the "Free School Society of New York" and again in 1826 to the "Public School Society of New York", with power "to provide for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of all children not otherwise provided for". This <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> gradually became, under the control of intolerant sectarian <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, a combination against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests so that, when, in 1840, the eight <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with an attendance of about 4000 pupils, made a demand for the share of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> appropriations to which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> entitled them, it was refused by the Board of Aldermen after a memorable hearing of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> petition in the City Hall on 29-30 October, 1840, at which Bishop Hughes made one of his greatest oratorical efforts. As a result of this contest the Public School Society was soon after abolished, and the present system of public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> control was enacted. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of New York also determined to organize and maintain their own system of free <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. "Go", Bishop Hughes told them, "build your own <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; raise arguments in the shape of the best <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and most moral citizens of the Republic, and the day will come when you will enforce recognition".

<p>To supply <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the diocese Bishop Dubois established a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Nyack-on-Hudson, in 1833, but it was burned down just as it was ready to be opened. <a href="../cathen/07190a.htm">Cornelius Heeney</a> then offered the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the ground in Brooklyn on which St. Paul's church now stands, refusing, however, to give the diocese the title to the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> immediately, and the design to build in Brooklyn was abandoned. In 1838 the estate of John Lafarge, Grovemont, in Jefferson County, was purchased and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> begun there. The place was then so inaccessible and impracticable that it was given up, and, on 24 June, 1841, Bishop Hughes, administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, opened with thirty students the new St. John's <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and college at <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>, then a village just outside the city. The Rev. John McCloskey, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New York and first <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was its first president. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> remained at <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a> until 24 Oc., 1864, when it was moved again to Troy, where St. Joseph's <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> began with fifty-seven students transferred from <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>. The faculty was composed of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> from <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, under the direction of the Very Reverend H. Vanderhende. Here the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> remained until 1896, during which period more than 700 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> there. The building was then given over to the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Diocese of Albany</a> as a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and training-school, and, on 12 August, 1896, the new provincial <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Dunwoodie was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> dedicated by <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Cardinal Satolli</a>, then <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The care of this <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was entrusted to the Sulpician Fathers, but these retired in 1906, and the work was continued by the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> of the archdiocese. A further step in providing facilities for <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> training was taken up by Archbishop Farley in September, 1903, by the opening of Cathedral College for the preparatory studies of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students.

<p>In the cause of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> the work done by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publishers must be noted; for New York, with the increase of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, developed also into a great producing and distributing centre for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature of all kinds. It is claimed for <a href="../cathen/05135c.htm">Bernard Dornin</a> who arrived in New York in 1803, an exile from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, that he was the first publisher of exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> works in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. His edition of Pastorini's "History of the Christian Church" (1807) was the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> book published in New York. The next year he issued an edition of <a href="../cathen/06101c.htm">Dr. Fletcher's</a> "Reflections on the Spirit of Religious Controversy", for which he had 144 city subscribers. There were 318 for the Pastorini book, and these two lists make an interesting directory of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> New York <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> at the opening of the nineteenth century. <a href="../cathen/05135c.htm">Dornin</a> left New York for Baltimore in 1809. He was followed in New York by Matthew Field who published "at his <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> 177 Bowery within a few doors of Delancey St." the first American year book, "The Catholic Laity's Directory to the Church Service: with an almanac for the year 1817". About 1823 John Doyle began to publish books at 237 Broadway, and, up to 1849, when he went to <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, he had issued many books of instruction and devotion. Most of the Doyle plates were taken over by Edward Dunnigan, who had associated with him in business his half-brother James B. Kirker. He was the first publisher to encourage <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authors to give him their writings. John Gilmary Shea's early histories were published by this firm, as was a fine edition of <a href="../cathen/07160a.htm">Haydock's</a> Bible (1844) and many school-books and standard works. In 1837 Dennis and James Sadlier began to issue Butler's "Lives of the Saints" and an edition of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in monthly parts, and thus commenced what later developed into one of the largest book concerns in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The list of their publications is as varied as it is lengthy, and remarkable for the time was their series of "Metropolitan" <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> books. Patrick O'Shea, who had been associated with the Dunigan concern, began for himself in 1854 and, until his death, in 1906, was a very industrious producer of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> books, his publications including, besides a great number of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> books, many editions of valuable works, such as <a href="../cathen/04636a.htm">Darras'</a> "History of the Church", Digby's "Mores", <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Brownson's</a> "American Republic", <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard's</a> "History of England", <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman's</a> and <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire's</a> works. Benziger Brothers, in 1853, opened the branch of their German house that developed into the great concern, covering all branches of the trade. <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Isaac T. Hecker, C.S.P.</a>, as part of his dream for the evangelization of his non-Catholic fellow-countrymen, founded, in 1866, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Publication Society. Into this enterprise his brother, George V. Hecker, also a convert, unselfishly put thousands of dollars. Its manager was Lawrence Kehoe, a man well versed in all the best ideals of the trade, who sent out its many books, bound and printed in a lavishness of style not attempted before.
<h3>Charities</h3>

<p>New York gave early evidence of the characteristic of heroic charity. In a letter written by Father Kohlmann, 21 March, 1809, he mentions "applications made at all houses to raise a subscription for the relief of the poor by which means $3000 have been collected to be paid constantly each year". New York then had only one church for its 16,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. An <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> was opened in 1817 in a small wooden house at Mott and Prince Streets, the "New York Catholic Benevolent Society", for its support and management, was incorporated the same year by the Legislature-the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Society so legalized in the state-and Mother Seton sent three of her Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg to take care of the children. This asylum was moved in 1851 to the block adjoining the Cathedral in Fifth Avenue and remained there until this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was sold and the institution located in Westchester County, in 1901. A Union Emigrant Society, to aid immigrants, the precursor of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Emigrant Society and the Emigrant Industrial Savings bank (see <a href="../cathen/05402b.htm">E<font size=-2>MIGRANT</font> A<font size=-2>ID</font> S<font size=-2>OCIETIES</font></a>) was organized in 1829. St. Patrick's the first New York Conference of the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, was affiliated to the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Council in 1849, and in the steady increase of the organization throughout the diocese opened a new field or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charity. The sturdy fight that had to be made against the raids on poor and neglected <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children in the public institutions was mainly through its members, and out of their efforts, in great measure, also grew the great <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Protectory, the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin, the Foundling Asylum, and the more recent Fresh Air and Convalescent Homes, Day Nurseries, and other incidental details of modern philanthropy.

<p>The progress of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is shown by the records kept of the gradual growth of population which made a great <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> out of the small provincial city. The notable increase begins with the immigration during the canal and railroad-building period, after 1825, the exodus from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> following the famine year of 1847, and the German flight after the Revolutionary disturbances of 1848. In 1826 in New York City there were bu three churches and 30,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; and in the whole diocese (including New Jersey) only eight churches, eighteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 150,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> figures for 1850 are recorded as follows: churches, 57; <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 5; stations, 50; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 99; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, 1, with 34 students; academies, 9; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, 1; <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, 15; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, 200,000.
