<h1>Archdiocese of Oregon City</h1>  

<p>(OREGONOPOLITAN).

<p>Includes that part of the state of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> west of the Cascade Mountains, being bounded on the east by the counties of Wasco, Crook, and Klamath. It comprises an area of 21,398 square miles. By an <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 28 February, 1836, the Oregon Country north of the American line was annexed to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> of Mgr Provencher of Red River. By letters of 17 April, 1838, <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Rev. F.N. Blanchet</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Quebec and assigned to the <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> mission. The <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> established his first mission at St. Paul on the Willamette, and on 6 January, 1839, dedicated at that place the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>. The church had been constructed three years earlier by the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> settlers who had anticipated the coming of a missionary among them.

<p>As the line of demarcation between British and American territory was still undecided, and missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had been sent into the country both from <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (De Smet had come from St. Louis), <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> became a joint mission depending upon the Bishops of Quebec and <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. At the suggestion of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the mission was erected in a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> by a brief of 1 December, 1843. On 24 July, 1846, the vicariate was transformed into a province comprising the Archdiocese of Oregon City and the Dioceses of Walla Walla and Vancouver's Island. With the transfer of the See of Walla Walla to Nesqually (1848), the northern boundary of the Archdiocese of Oregon City was fixed at the Columbia River and the 46&#176; lat. This territory was diminished by the erection of the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a> (1868) and finally received its present limits by the erection of the <a href="../cathen/02213b.htm">Diocese of Baker City</a> (1903).

<p>Bishops: <ol><li><a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Fran&ccedil;ois Norbert Blanchet</a>, b. 3 September, 1795, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 25 July, 1845. There were in the diocese in 1845 ten <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, thirteen Sisters of Notre-Dame, and two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> was Father Jayol, the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> being performed by <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Archbishop Blanchet</a> at St. Paul, 19 September, 1847. On 30 November, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at St. Paul, <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Bishop Demers</a> of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver's</a> Island. He convened the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Oregon City, 28 February, 1848. On 21 December, <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Archbishop Blanchet</a> left St. Paul and took up his residence at Oregon City. In 1852 the first church in the City of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a> was dedicated under the title of the Immaculate Conception. It became the pro-cathedral when <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Archbishop Blanchet</a> moved to Portland in 1862. <li><a href="../cathen/13682a.htm">Charles John Seghers</a>, b. 26 December, 1839, at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, successor to the pioneer <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Demers</a> of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver's</a> Island, was transferred to Oregon City, 10 December, 1878, and become coadjutor to <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Archbishop Blanchet</a> who at once retired from active life. <a href="../cathen/13682a.htm">Archbishop Seghers</a> is remembered for his heroic devotion to the Indian missions of <a href="../cathen/01246b.htm">Alaska</a>, which led him to resign the See of Oregon City in 1884. <li>William H. Gross (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a>, 1873) was promoted to the archiepiscopal See of Oregon City, 1 February, 1885, and invested with the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> in Portland by His Eminence Cardinal Gibbons 9 Oct. On his death 14 November, 1898, he was succeeded by the present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. <li>Most Rev. Alexander Christie (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver's</a> Island, 29 June, 1898) was promoted to the archiepiscopal See of Oregon City, 12 February, 1899. </ol> Statistics for 1909: <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 50; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of rel. orders, 40; colleges, 3; secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 12; elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 35; pupils, 5500.
