<h1>Archdiocese of Perugia</h1>  

<p>(PERUSINA)

<p>Located in Umbria, Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated on a hill on the right of the Tiber. The Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is of the fourteenth century, its <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> being yet unfinished; it contains <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/02303a.htm">Baroccio</a>, Manni, and <a href="../cathen/13787a.htm">Signorelli</a>; there is a marble sarcophagus in which are the remains of <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> del Santo Anello is preserved an onyx ring, which is said to have been the marriage ring of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, and which was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> first at Chiusi, where it was <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a>, and then taken to Perugia in the fifteenth century; in the chapter <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> is preserved a codex of the <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">Gospel of St. Luke</a>, of the sixth century. Other churches are: San Pietro dei Cassinesi, the church of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded by St. Peter Vincioli about 1000; Sant' Ercolano, the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of which is made of an ancient sarcophagus; Sant' Angelo, a round building, dating from the sixth century; the Madonna della Luce, a graceful little temple by <a href="../cathen/01284a.htm">Galeazzo Alessio</a>; San Francesco del <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a>, now the seat of the "Accademia" of <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, founded in 1320, has three faculties, and contains a museum of Etruscan, Roman, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquities, with many <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> and inscriptions, among the latter, the "Tabul&aelig; Perusin&aelig;", discovered in 1822. The most notable ancient monuments of the town are the Porta Augusta; the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Volumnii, which was discovered in 1840 by Vermiglioli; and the Etruscan walls.

<p>Perugia was among the most important cities of the Etruscans, with whom it took part in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 310 and 295 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, as also in the Samnite War. The Perugian War (41 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) is famous; the troops of Anthony were shut up here, where they were compelled to surrender. During the Gothic War, Perugia suffered various sieges, by the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> in 537 and in 552, and by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> in 546 and 548. The Lombards at the time of their first incursion had taken possession of the city, but in 592 it came again under the Byzantine power and was made the seat of a <em>dux</em>. In 749 it was besieged by the Lombard King Rachis, who, however, was persuaded by <a href="../cathen/15743b.htm">Pope Zacharias</a> to raise the siege. Pepin gave the city to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. From the beginning of the eleventh century, Perugia was established as a free commune and was in struggles with the neighbouring cities of Umbria and of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> (Chiusi, 1012; Cortona, 1049; Assisi, 1054; Todi, 1056; Foligno, 1080 and 1090); it was governed by consuls (from 5 to 16). for whom were substituted in 1303 the <em>priori delle arti</em>; after 1174 there was a <em>podest&agrave;</em>, and later a <em>capitano del popolo</em>.

<p>Perugia, friendly to Florence and faithful to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, was essentially a <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> city, and in the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> established their residence here for a long time; four of them were elected here (Honorius III, <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>). On the other hand, continuing its <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with neighbouring cities (Spoleto, from 1324, was besieged for two years), Perugia extended its sovereignty over the greater portion of Umbria, and over a part of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. In 1375 it was among the first cities that revolted against <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> at the instance of the Florentines. Meanwhile, there had been formed two parties: the Raspanti (the popular party) and the Beccarini (the party of the nobles), and between them they had made it possible for Biondo Michelotti to become lord of the city in 1390; he, however, was killed in 1393, and then Gian Galeazzo Visconti took possession of the town; but in 1403 it became subject to <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>. Afterwards it fell into the power of Ladislao di Napoli; in 1416 the city was taken by Braccio da Montone, who was recognized as lord of Perugia by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>. At his death in 1424 the nobles came into power, but contention soon developed among them, and eventually the Baglioni made away with the Oddi <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Finally, Gian Paolo Baglione became a tyrant of the city, making himself detested by his cruelty and dissolute habits. He was reduced to order in 1506 by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>; but fresh cruelties against his own relations led to his decapitation by order of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in 1520; Perugia then came once more into immediate dependency upon the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>In 1534 Rodolfo Baglione set fire to the Apostolic palace, and the vicelegate was slain; and no sooner had order been established after these events, than a rebellion broke out on account of the tax on salt, which <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> had increased in 1540; Perugia declared itself a "city of Christ", and confided its keys to the care of a crucifix. On 5 July, however, it was compelled to surrender to the troops of Pierluigi Farnese and lost its freedom. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> built a fortress to prevent further revolts of the Perugians, while <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> restored to them the greater part of their privileges. In the rebellion of 1848, the first act of the Perugians was to demolish the tower of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>. In 1859 there was a provisional Government established, but the Pontifical troops soon took possession of the city, though they did not commit the acts of cruelty of which they have been accused. Finally in 1860 General de Sonnaz took possession of the town in the name of the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>.

<p>Blessed John of Perugia, one of the first companions of St. Francis, died in 1230. In the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> are found the names of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Constantius (Constantinus, whom some believe to have been a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>), Florentius, and Felicissimus, who died at Perugia. Under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> one Decentius was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, according to the tradition; but the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of whom there is any certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was St. Herculanus, killed by King Totila in 546; many admit there were two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of this name, of whom the first is said to have died either in one of the great persecutions or under <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> (Cappelletti).

<p>St. Herculanus was succeeded by Joannes, who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/11602a.htm">Pope Pelagius I</a> (566); Aventius (591); Laurentius (649); Benenatus (679); St. Asclepiodorus (about 700), whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were later taken to Metz; Conon (998) and Andreas (1033), who had various controversies with the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of San Pietro; Joannes (1105), who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Monte Corona; Vivianus, who was present at the council of 1179; Giovanni (1206), who gave a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> to St. Francis; Salvio de' Salvi (1231), a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, who restored Santo Stefano, the ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Francesco Poggi, O. Min. (1312), who built S. Domenico nuovo; Andrea Bontempi (1339), a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> general of Umbria; Andrea Giovanni Baglione (1434), who filled several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> with reformed religious; Dionisio Vannucci (1482), who erected the altar of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> del Sacro Anello; Giovanni Lopez (1492), a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> who enjoyed influence under <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>; Trilo Baglione (1501), deposed by <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> for having taken up arms against C&aelig;sar Borgia and restored to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>; Antonio Ferreri (1506), who suspected by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> died in the Castle of S. Angelo in 1508; Cardinal Agostino Spinola (1510), under whom the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, who since the twelfth century had lived according to the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, were relieved of that rule; Jacopo Simonetti (1535), a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; Fulvio Corneo (1550), reformer of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Ippolito Corneo (1553), who established a house of reform, and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for poor young men; Giulio Oradini (1562), who founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for clerks; Napoleone Comitoli (1591), the founder of other <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>; M.
