<h1>Archdiocese of Philadelphia</h1>  

<p>(PHILADELPHIENSIS)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> established in 1808; made an archdiocese, 12 Feb., 1875, comprises all the city and county of Philadelphia, and the counties of Berks, Bucks, Carbon, <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, <a href="../cathen/04692a.htm">Delaware</a>, Lehigh, Montgomery, <a href="../cathen/11107b.htm">Northampton</a>, and Schuylkill, an area of 5043 square miles, in the southeastern portion of the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">State of Pennsylvania</a>. The population of this area, according to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Census, in 1910, was 2,712,708, of which number 1,549,008 belonged to the City of Philadelphia. This city, the capital of the archdiocese, was, until 1800, the capital of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. It is the third city in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in population; its wealth invested in manufacturing industries exceeds $500,000,000, and it is the leading American city in shipbuilding, the manufacture of locomotive engines, street-railway cars, carpets, leather, oilcloth, and several other important commodities. In 1909 the foreign commerce of Philadelphia amounted to $150,504,095.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Penn's colony, founded in 1682, as a "holy experiment", by which each man could without molestation worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to the dictates of his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> (see <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">PENNSYLVANIA</a>), soon became a welcome haven of refuge to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the neighbouring colonies. Since the missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, mainly <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, watched over the movements of the members of their scattered flocks, it is not surprising that in their frequent journeyings between New York and <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> they should find opportunity to gather the faithful in the house of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> for the celebration of the sacred mysteries and preaching the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. There was a steady growth in the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> throughout the colony, including some distinguished converts. Repeated complaints were made to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, that the "Popish Mass" was read publicly at Philadelphia; but Penn's "Fundamental" shielded the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in his province from molestation. The first resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Philadelphia was Father Joseph Greaton, S.J., who began his labours among the missions of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> in 1720. His first concern was to build a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and rectory. With this object he bought the ground where the first public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was erected in Philadelphia, and where still stands old St. Joseph's church, near Fourth and Walnut Streets. In 1741 Father Greaton received an assistant in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Rev. Henry Neale, S.J. Welcome financial aid came to the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> missions through the bounty of Sir John James, of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, who made a bequest in their favour. The German immigrants were looked after by two missionaries from the Fatherland, Rev. Theodore Schneider of Heidelberg, who resided in Berks Co., at Goshenhoppen, and Father Wappeler of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, who attended the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Conewago and Lancaster. Father Neale died 5 May, 1748; and the aged Greaton retired to <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, where he ended his saintly career, 19 Aug., 1753.

<p>The second <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Philadelphia was Father Robert Harding, born in Nottinghamshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 6 Oct., 1701, who, having entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, came to America in 1732. He assumed charge of Philadelphia in 1749 and laboured with intelligence and success for twenty-three years. During the excitement of the French and Indian War charges of disloyalty were brought against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but passed away without causing suffering. Father Harding estimated the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Philadelphia as about 2000. Another deserving labourer in the vineyard was the German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/14285b.htm">Father Steinmeyer</a>, known in the colony as Ferdinand Farmer. He laboured first at Lancaster among the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, afterwards as assistant to Father Harding. He is described as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, and in 1779 was a trustee of the University of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Father Harding purchased land for a new church and cemetery. The church was opened in 1763 as St. Mary's; it became the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, St. Joseph's remaining a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. Father Harding died 1 Sept., 1772, and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at St. Mary's. He was succeeded by the Rev. Robert Molyneux, who, together with <a href="../cathen/14285b.htm">Father Farmer</a>, skilfully guided the infant Church during the stormy days of the Revolution. Like the majority of their flock, they remained neutral, till the coming of the French allies called for repeated services on occasions of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or sorrow; the addresses, however, were mostly delivered by the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the French ambassador.

<p>At the end of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> Father Molyneux opened the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In Oct., 1785, the sacrament of Confirmation was administered for the first time in Philadelphia by the Very Rev. John Carroll, <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>. On 17 Aug. of the following year <a href="../cathen/14285b.htm">Father Farmer</a> passed to his reward. His funeral was attended by the American Philosophical Society, the professors and trustees of the University of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, and by large numbers of non-Catholics. No one had done so much to make the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion respected by the residents of <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a> and <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Father Molyneux soon after retired from active service and was succeeded by the Rev. Francis Beeston, who built the presbytery of St. Joseph's which is still occupied by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In 1788 a number of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> agitated for a new distinctively German church: Dr. Carroll reluctantly consented, warning them against a feeling of separatism and admonishing them that they could not be permitted to name their own <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. In 1795 the German church was ready for occupancy and was named <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, being, it is said, the last building for public purposes erected in Philadelphia of alternate red and black glazed brick. This church gave great trouble to Bishop Carroll, on account of the pretensions of the trustees, and had to be placed under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. The three churches now built, St. Joseph's, St. Mary's, and <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, were all in the southern part of the city. Provision had to be made for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> living in what was then the extreme northern section. Opportunely, the Augustinians were seeking to found a house in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and to them the new congregation was entrusted. In 1796 the Rev. Matthew Carr, O.S.A., issued an appeal to the inhabitants of Philadelphia and received a generous response. President Washington figures in the list of subscribers, for $50, <a href="../cathen/02310b.htm">Commodore Barry</a>, for $150, and Stephen Girard, for $40. After many vicissitudes, "the largest church in Philadelphia" was dedicated under the invocation of St. Augustine, 7 June, 1801. When Father Carr removed to his new residence near St. Augustine's, the trustees of St. Mary's petitioned the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to send them a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> capable of sustaining the dignity of "the leading church in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>". The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> found them the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> they were looking for in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Rev. Michael Egan, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> stationed at Lancaster. He had come to America in order to establish in this country a house of his order, but found the time premature and became a missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Bishop Carroll. He was ably assisted at St. Mary's by Father Rossiter.



<p>The time having arrived when Philadelphia should be erected into an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 8 April, 1808, designated the diocese as including "the entire two States of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and Delaware, and the western and southern part of the <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">State of New Jersey</a>". An accompanying <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> appointed Father Michael Egan to be the first occupant of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Owing to the existing political conditions in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the Briefs did not reach Baltimore until 1810, and during the interval Father Egan remained in Philadelphia as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to Bishop Carroll. On 10 Nov., 1808, there arrived in Philadelphia the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Father William Vincent Harold, who came from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> recommended by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> and other dignitaries. Bishop Egan accepted him with eagerness, and the eloquent preacher soon became a great favourite. Bishop Egan having been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 28 Oct., 1810, made Father Harold his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and took up his residence at St. Joseph's with him and an uncle of his, the Rev. James Harold, who had arrived from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in March, 1811. Relations between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the Harolds became strained for domestic reasons not well explained. Trouble arose between the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the trustees, and the Harolds returned to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. After a troubled administration of three years and nine months Bishop Egan died at the age of fifty-three. The trustees of St. Mary's had acquired for themselves such a reputation for insubordination, that it was no easy matter to find any one willing to take up the burden of the episcopate. Fathers Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal, DeBarth and David declined to accept.

<p>Finally, after an interval of five years, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> selected the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of Armagh, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the Very Rev. Henry Conwell, seventy-two years old. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> by Bishop Poynter, 24 Sept., 1820, and arrived in Philadelphia on 25 Nov., of that year. A very disagreeable <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> was awaiting him in the case of the Rev. William Hogan, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a> whom the administrator had imprudently admitted to the diocese without sufficient inquiry or credentials. <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Bishop England</a> states that he was "deficient in the most common branches of an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>". But he was a man of fine personal presence, affluent talker, a born demagogue, and able to preach in topics which tickled the ears of men whose religion was a matter of fashion. A clear and impartial narrative of the Hogan Schism is found in Father Kirlin's excellent work, "Catholicity in Philadelphia". (See also <a href="../cathen/04349a.htm">HENRY CONWELL</a>.) It remains a question whether the Hogan <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, which engrossed the interest of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> throughout the entire nation, did not do more good than harm. It focussed the attention of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics on the important question of episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. While some lukewarm <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> fell away from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the body of the faithful rallied to their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> with ardour and increased intelligence. The question of lay interference in the administration of the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was settled for all time in Philadelphia. The repudiation by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07380a.htm">United States</a> of the compromise of 9 Oct., 1826, in which Bishop Conwell surrendered to the already beaten trustees several episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, ended forever in these States the tyranny of trusteeism.

<p>On 7 July, 1830, there arrived in the city of Philadelphia a man who was to shed lustre on the diocese and on the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Francis Patrick Kenrick</a>. Having been appointed coadjutor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he found a valuable lieutenant in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Rev. John Hughes, a man five or six months his junior, who remained <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick's</a> right hand and secretary until his own elevation to the See of New York. After fruitless admonitions to the trustees of St. Mary's, the administrator, on 16 April, 1831, closed the church and cemeteries of St. Mary's. On 18 May the trustees surrendered, and on 28 May the church was reopened. In 1832 <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a> opened what eventually became the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Charles Borromeo, the beneficent results of which were soon apparent. During the first two years of this administration the number of churches was doubled, the first addition being the church of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a> built by Father John Hughes and dedicated 8 April, 1832, which was soon followed by that of St. John Baptist, Manayunk, with the Rev. Thomas Gegan as first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. On 8 April, 1833, was laid the cornerstone of St. Michael's church at Kensington, organized by the Rev. Terence J. Donoghue.

<p>When the awful cholera scourge visited Philadelphia in 1832, the intrepidity of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and sisters presented an example of heroic <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Christian charity</a> which was long remembered. On 14 May, 1837, death called away one of the most valiant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the city, Father Michael Hurley, O.S.A., who almost from the beginning of the century had given great edification by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and saintly life. Later in the same year the Rev. John Hughes was elevated to the episcopal See of New York. About the same time St. John's became the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1839 the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> was founded for the Fairmount district, and St. Patrick's church was organized for the Schuylkill suburb. The following year saw the founding of St. Philip's in the extreme south. Its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> was the Rev. John P. Dunn. In 1842 the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> of Kensington were provided for by the building of St. Peter's and the installation of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a>. In 1843 the church of St. Paul was opened in Moyamensing by the Rev. Patrick F. Sheridan. To the north, the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Stephen was built near the spot in Nicetown where the first Masses were celebrated by itinerant missionaries. On 15 Nov., 1846, St. Anne's church at Port Richmond was dedicated by Father Gartland of St. John's, Bishop Hughes of New York preaching the sermon. During the year 1845, St. Joachim's was founded at Frankford by the Rev. Dominic Forrestal. On the Feast of Sts. Peter and Paul, 29 June, 1846, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> issued a pastoral letter announcing his determination to build a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He chose for the site a plot of ground adjoining the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Eighteenth and Race Streets. The architect was Napoleon <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>. It was the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> intention to avoid running into <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was long in building. In 1848 he founded the church of the Assumption, with the convert, Charles I. H. Carter, for <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The ancient suburb of Germantown contained very few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers, who conducted the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, were willing to assume the risk of building a church in that section, and the church of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> was opened for worship on 13 July, 1851, the first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> being the Rev. M. Domenec, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>. In 1849 a church was built at Holmesburg and named St. Dominic, the Rev. Charles Dominic Berrill, O.P., being appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In 1850 the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. James, in West Philadelphia, was founded by the Rev. J. V. O'Keefe, who took a census and discovered forty <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> adults in the district. The last evidence in Philadelphia of <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick's</a> activity was the church of <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a>, the cornerstone of which he blessed 25 May, 1851. Before its completion he was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. The western portion of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> was formed into the Diocese of Pittsburg, 8 Aug., 1843, with the Rt. Rev. M. O'Connor, D.D., for its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. (For the burning of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches in the Philadelphia riots of 1844, see <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">KNOWNOTHINGISM</a>.)

<p>The fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia, John Nepomucene Neumann, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 28 March, 1852. (See JOHN NEPOMUCENE NEUMANN.) Ten churches sprang up during the first year of his episcopate. The constant topic of his exhortations was the necessity of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Failing to bring the contumacious trustees of <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> to their senses, he undermined their influence by putting up the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Alphonsus. On 19 Oct., 1854, he left for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assist at the proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception, and he returned in March, 1855. On 26 April, 1857, the Rt. Rev. James Frederick Wood was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> as coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia. Bishop Wood was acknowledged by the financial world as thoroughly acquainted with every phase of the banking business, which had been the occupation of his earlier years. At a meeting of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, Bishop Neumann announced that the work of completing the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> had been committed to his coadjutor. In October, 1857, he held his last synod: there were 114 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> present, and 32 had been excused from attendance.

<p>James Frederick Wood, the fifth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was born at Philadelphia 27 April, 1813. His father, James Wood, was an English merchant and had his child <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by a minister of the <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. In 1827 James Wood and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> removed to <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, where the boy obtained a position as clerk in a bank. Eleven years later (7 April, 1838), in his twenty-fifth year, the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell</a>, and next year he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to prosecute his studies at the College of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> by Cardinal Fransoni, 25 March, 1844. After a short term as assistant at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Patrick's church. Though the main object of his appointment to Philadelphia was to relieve Bishop Neumann of the temporal cares of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, yet he by no means confined his efforts to that sphere. He was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in preaching the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and gave confirmation in all the churches. On the death of Bishop (Venerable John Nepomucene) Neumann, which took place on 5 January, 1860, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which still included Delaware, was estimated at 200,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. There were 157 churches (besides in course of erection) and 7 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, attended by 147 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Glen Riddle, under the Rev. J. F. Shanahan, and the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> adjoining the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, under the Rev. Wm. O'Hara, D.D., were in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. There were 36 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, attended by 8710 pupils. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was well supplied with colleges, academies, asylums, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of both sexes. In the first year of his administration Bishop Wood established, at the two extreme ends of the city the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the Annunciation and All Saints, Bridesburg.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had the erection of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> well in hand, when the outbreak of the Civil War came to retard its completion. Nothing daunted, however, he continued his efforts and on 20 Nov., 1864, had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to sing the first Mass in the immense edifice. Scarcely had he finished the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, when he purchased a large tract of land just outside the city limits, as the site of a new <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The pastoral letter in which he announced the purchase at Overbrook is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 8 Dec., 1865; on 16 Sept., 1871, the beautiful building was filled with 128 students from the two old <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. During his visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1867, he petitioned the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the creation of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/13633a.htm">Scranton</a> and Harrisburg, and his wish was granted 3 March, 1868. He was prominent at the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, and, indeed, at every assembly of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> his counsels were reverently listened to. He attended the Council of the Vatican, but being in poor health left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> early in March. He took a great interest in the newly established North American College, wisely insisted that the funds of the college should be kept in America, and was unanimously appointed treasurer of the board.

<p>On 15 Oct., 1873, with all possible pomp, Bishop Wood <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the diocese to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. In 1875 he was prostrated by rheumatism; a journey to the South gave him slight relief; and when the instruments arrived creating him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and making Philadelphia a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, it was with evident pain he went through the long <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the conferring of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. He had wonderful recuperative powers, however, and in 1877 went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with $30,000 <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's pence</a> to assist at the celebration of the golden jubilee of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX's</a> episcopate. Recovering from another bad attack in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he returned home. On 23 May, 1880, he presided over the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Philadelphia. After this he was for the most part confined to his room, where, however, he continued to transact business with his usual energy. His end came on 20 June, 1883. The entire City of Philadelphia turned out to show its affection for one whom it regarded as its most distinguished citizen. Archbishop Wood is buried with the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> beneath the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He had administered the Sacrament of Confirmation to 105,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. In 1868, in the curtailed diocese, there were 76 churches and 21 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; at his death there were 127 churches and 53 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. He found, in 1858, 33 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in this section; he left 58.

<p>The choice of a successor to Archbishop Wood demanded thought on the part of the Roman authorities, and they took a year to come to a decision. At first they seemed to consider favourably the venerable Bishop O'Hara of <a href="../cathen/13633a.htm">Scranton</a>, who, as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> had done valuable service in Philadelphia. There is little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he would have been selected, had it not been for his seventy odd years. The deliberations of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> finally concluded with the choice of the coadjutor of St. Louis; the Rt. Rev. Patrick John Ryan, who was in his fifty-second year, had administered an important diocese for ten years, and seemed to lack no qualification demanded by so eminent a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> as Philadelphia. (See PATRICK J. RYAN.)

<p>On 20 Aug., 1884, he took formal possession of his <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> and received the homage of 250 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In November of that year he opened the proceedings of the Third Plenary Council, and on 4 January, 1885, was invested with the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. After 24 Feb., 1897, he was ably assisted by his <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, the Rt. Rev. Edmond F. Prendergast. On the death of Archbishop Ryan, which took place on 11 February, 1911, Bishop Prendergast assumed the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>Philadelphia is also the residence of the Rt. Rev. Soter Stephen Ortynski, the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian Greek Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06744a.htm">GREEK CATHOLICS IN THE UNITED STATES</a>).

<p>There is probably no diocese in the world better provided with institutions of religion, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and charity than Philadelphia. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system is admirably organized. There are 141 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> teaching 63,612 children. There are 149 <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students preparing for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and there is never a lack of vocations. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was estimated in 1910 at 525,000, whose spiritual needs are supplied by 582 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, regular and secular. There are 434 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and stations. The religious institutes established in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a> (14), <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian Fathers</a> (Villanova and six other establishments, 33 fathers), <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a> (4 houses, 1 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, 1 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, 15 fathers), <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentian</a> Fathers (3 houses, 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, 24 fathers), <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> (2 houses, 1 college, 22 fathers), <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> (10 houses, 89 brothers). There are in the diocese (1911) 2565 religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> and 11 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls under the care of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The religious institutes for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are: <a href="../cathen/02599a.htm">Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament</a>, Sisters of Charity, <a href="../cathen/03711a.htm">Sisters of Christian Charity</a>, <a href="../cathen/06027b.htm">Felician Sisters</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Tertiaries, Missionary Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis, Sisters of the Good Shepherd, Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus, Sisters of the Most Holy Family of Nazareth, Sisters-Servants of the Immaculate Heart, Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> (Philadelphia foundation and Scranton foundation), School Sisters of Notre Dame, <a href="../cathen/11128b.htm">Sisters of Notre Dame (Namur)</a>, <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, Religious of the Sacred Heart, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a>, <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardine</a>, Sisters of St. Francis (Polish), Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart, <a href="../cathen/12254a.htm">Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ</a>, Fili&aelig; Mari&aelig;.
