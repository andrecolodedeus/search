<h1>Archdiocese of Pondicherry</h1>  

<p>(PONDICHERIANA OR PUDICHERIANA)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, it is bounded on the east by the Bay of Bengal, divided on the north from the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> and San Thom&eacute; (Mylapore) by the River Palar, on the west from the <a href="../cathen/10661d.htm">Diocese of Mysore</a> by the River Chunar and the Mysore civil boundaries, and from the <a href="../cathen/04095a.htm">Diocese of Coimbatore</a> by the River Cauvery; on the south by the River Vellar from the <a href="../cathen/08710a.htm">Diocese of Kumbakonam</a>. Besides Pondicherry itself, and the portion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> contiguous to it, the archdiocese includes all the smaller outlying French possessions, namely Karikal and Yanaon on the east coast, Mahe on the west coast, and Chandernagore in Bengal. The total <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population in French territory is 25,859, the rest, out of a total of 143,125, belonging to the North and South Arcot, Chingleput and Salem districts, all in British confines. There are 78 churches and 210 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, served by 102 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (78 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and 24 native). The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is under the charge of the <a href="../cathen/14079a.htm">Society of Foreign Missions</a>, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> residence, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> are at Pondicherry. The Fathers are assisted by four congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, viz., of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Order</a>, of the Sacred Heart of Mary, of St. Joseph, and of <a href="../cathen/01331c.htm">St. Aloysius Gonzaga</a>.

<p>The districts covered by the Pondicherry Archdiocese were originally comprised within the <em>padroado</em> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of San Thom&eacute;, but mission-work did not extend beyond the north-west corner near San Thom&eacute;, and a small portion in the south which lay within the limits of the Madura mission. Pondicherry itself was only a village till some shipwrecked <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> under Francis Martin settled there in 1674 and afterwards purchased it from the Raja of Vijayapur. About this time some <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> arrived to take care of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> in the new settlement, and a few years later (in 1690) some <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> followed and began to work among the natives &#151; both under <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. From Pondicherry the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> gradually proceeded inland and founded what was called the Carnatic mission about 1700. On the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> in 1773 the whole field was entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Seminary for Foreign Missions, including the Madura districts, where the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">disbanded Jesuits</a> continued to work under the new regime till they gradually died out. In 1836 (Brief of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, 8 July) the mission of Pondicherry was made into the Vicariate Apostolic of the Coromandel coast. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (who had been restored in 1814) were placed once more in charge of the Madura mission, excepting the portion north of the Cauvery River, which was retained by Pondicherry. In 1850 the Vicariate of the Coromandel coast was divided and two new vicariates erected &#151; those of <a href="../cathen/10661d.htm">Mysore</a> and <a href="../cathen/04095a.htm">Coimbatore</a>. On the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1886, Pondicherry was elevated into an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> with Mysore and Coimbatore as suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Diocese of Malacca</a> outside <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. Finally in 1899 the southern portion of the archdiocese was separated and made into the (suffragan) <a href="../cathen/08710a.htm">Diocese of Kumbakonam</a> &#151; he whole province remaining under the same missionary Society.

<p>Among its <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were: Pierre Brigot, 1776-91 (superior with episcopal orders); Nicholas Champenois, 1791-1810; Louis Charles Auguste Herbert; 1811-36; Clement Bonnand, 1836-61 (first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>); Joseph Isidore Godelle, 1861-67; Francis Jean Laouenan, 1868-92 (became first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in 1886); Joseph Adolphus Gandy, 1892-1909; Elias Jean Joseph Morel, present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> from 1909.
