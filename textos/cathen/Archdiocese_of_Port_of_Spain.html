<h1>Archdiocese of Port of Spain</h1>  

<p>(PORTUS HISPANI&AElig;)

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, including the Islands of Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada, the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and St. Lucia. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is about 200,000. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced by the Spanish discoverers and missions established in those islands where permanent settlements were effected. The first preachers of the Faith in Trinidad were Fathers Francisco de Cordova and Juan Garc&eacute;s, both <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who died at the hands of the Indians in 1513. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> arrived in 1596, and maintained their connexion with Trinidad until the British occupation in the beginning of the nineteenth century. Fathers Esteban de San Felix, Marco de Vique, and a lay-brother, Ramon de Figuerola, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, were slaughtered by the natives in 1699. Their bodies were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of San Jos&eacute; de Oru&ntilde;a, then the chief town of the colony, and they were <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the Faith. The Governor of the colony, Don Jos&eacute; de Leon, and a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Father Juan de Mosin Sotomayor, lost their lives defending them. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and other religious laboured in Grenada and the other islands, but as these colonies fell into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> hands they were replaced by the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. When in 1797 Trinidad was surrendered to Great Britain the status of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion underwent no change, as stipulated in the terms of capitulation granted by Sir Ralph Abercrombie. The new authorities undertook to contribute to the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and continue to do so. In 1820 at the instance of Governor Sir Ralph Woodford, the Trinidad <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Guayana, <a href="../cathen/15327a.htm">Venezuela</a>, and Mgr. James Buckley was appointed the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/12291a.htm">Port of Spain</a> was built during his administration. He was succeeded by Mgr. McDonnell, whose successor was Mgr. Richard Smith, the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Mgr. Vincent Spaccapietra, his successor, is held in veneration for his heroic exertions during an epidemic of cholera. On Mgr. Spaccapietra's transfer to the See of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, Mgr. Ferdinand English was appointed to <a href="../cathen/12291a.htm">Port of Spain</a>. He was succeeded by Mgr. J. L. Gonin, O.P., who requested the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> to resume in Trinidad the work begun by their predecessors in early Spanish days. A small number arrived in 1864; their number increased under Mgr. Patrick Vincent Flood, O.P., and their work extended to Grenada. On Mgr. Flood's death in 1907, during an extended vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, the name of a <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Father Albert Knapp, unaccountably appeared as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Port of Spain in many newspapers and a year book. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> appointed the present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Mgr. Dowling, born in County Kilkenny, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1886, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1909. Before his elevation to the episcopate he held important offices in his order, having been professor, novice-master, and previous to his coming to Trinidad as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the archdiocese, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the well-known College of San Clemente, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Most of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, only a few are natives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. English is taught exclusively in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and most generally spoken, though Creole patois is widely used by the lower classes except in Tobago and St. Vincent. Spanish is spoken in some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Trinidad and by Venezuelan residents of <a href="../cathen/12291a.htm">Port of Spain</a>. There are also many Portuguese. Confessors with a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these languages are provided and sermons preached in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Work amongst the East Indian immigrants makes a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the dialects of Hindustan needful. Number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 48; <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, 20; <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a>, 40; <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a>, 15; Fathers of Mary Immaculate, 20; and a few members of the Order of St. Augustine. Higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, 2, for girls, 4; 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> and 2 alms-houses. The Leper Asylum and the municipal alms-house are under the care of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a>, and many of the elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> under that of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>.
