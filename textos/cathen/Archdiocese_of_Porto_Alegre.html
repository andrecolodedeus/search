<h1>Archdiocese of Porto Alegre</h1>  

<p>(PORTALEGRENSIS)

<p>Located in Eastern <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. Porto Alegre, the capital and chief port of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, is built on the northern extremity of Lagoa dos Patos and on the eastern shore of the estuary called Rio Guahyba. It was founded in 1742 by a colony of immigrants from the <a href="../cathen/02168a.htm">Azores</a>, and was first known as Porto dos Cazaes. In 1770 Governor Jos&eacute; Marcellino de Figuereido selected it as his official residence, and in 1773 the town received its present name. Raised to the rank of a city in 1822, it was given in 1841 in recognition of its loyalty the title "leal e valorosa". The city is the chief commercial centre of the state, and has a harbour accessible to vessels of not more than ten feet draught. The principal industry of the state is stock-raising, which was first organized by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries in the seventeenth century. The <em>municipio</em> has an area of 931 sq. miles; the latest census returns assign the city (including several districts not within the municipal boundaries) a population of 73,574 inhabitants, for the most part of German and Italian extraction. The climate, while cool and bracing in winter, is intensely hot during the summer; the average annual rainfall exceeds thirty inches. Porto Alegre has four newspapers, including the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> "Deutsches Volksblatt"; the state institutions include the municipal palace, the governor's palace, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of engineering, the military college, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine, and four general <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was first introduced into the country by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in the early part of the seventeenth century, after the Indian slave hunters of <a href="../cathen/13465d.htm">S&atilde;o Paulo</a> had forced them to abandon their missions in Upper Paran&aacute;. In 1848 the state, which has an area of about 91,300 sq. miles, was formed into the Diocese of S&atilde;o Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul. On 4 March, 1910, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> divided the territory of the state between this see (which he raised to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank with the title of <a href="../cathen/12289c.htm">Porto Alegre</a>, now appointed its seat), and its newly created suffragans, <a href="../cathen/11610a.htm">Pelotas</a>, <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a>, <a href="../cathen/15233a.htm">Uruguayana</a>, and Florianopolis. The <a href="../cathen/14275a.htm">religious statistics</a> at the time of the division were: 1,400,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 115,000 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (including 5,000 <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a>), 134 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> charges, 245 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (including 225 regular), 68 brothers, 58 seminarians, nearly 400 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 6 gymnasiums, 2 normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 agricultural <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and more than 500 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges. The principal <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of the archdiocese are the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (St. Joseph's Church, <em>gymnasium</em> etc.), the <a href="../cathen/12107a.htm">Pallottini Fathers</a>, the Sisters of St. Francis, the Sisters of St. Catherine, the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, the Evangelical School Brothers, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> (who have charge of the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>). Nearly all the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> are managed by <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The chief churches are the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Our Lady Madre de Deus, the church of Nossa Senhora des Dores, and the (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>) <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Joseph. The present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is the Most Reverend Claoudi Jos&eacute; Gon&ccedil;alves Ponce de Le&atilde;o (born 21 Feb., 1841), transferred from the <a href="../cathen/06687a.htm">Diocese of Goyaz</a> to the former Diocese of Rio Grande on 13 May, 1881. On 21 February, 1906, Mgr Jo&atilde;o Antonio Pimenta, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11646a.htm">Pentacomia</a>, was appointed coadjutor with right of succession.
