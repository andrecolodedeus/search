<h1>Archdiocese of Quito</h1>  

<p>(QUITENSIS)

<p>The city of Quito, formerly known as San Francisco de Quito, capital of the Republic of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, is situated 14' south of the Equator, and 114 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean. It stands at an elevation of about 9300 feet, and has a population of some 70,000, mostly mestizos. It was the capital of the Incas Huaynacapac and Atahualpa, and was burnt by Rumi&ntilde;ahui in 1533. Sebasti&aacute;n de Belalc&aacute;zar captured Quito the following year. In 1541 it was made a city by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>; in 1565 it became the headquarters of a separate <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> province. Quito formed part of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> till 1718, when it was included in <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">Nueva Granada</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in charge of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> was the centre of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies for all middle and northern South America. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and Augustinians had high schools in Quito. In 1735 the city was ruined by an earthquake. Independence was declared there on 19 August, 1809; and the following year witnessed a terrible massacre of the nobility, even <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children being put to the sword. President Montes defeated the patriots two years later in the Panecillo; Sucre gained his great victory hard by in 1822. In 1829 Quito became the capital of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>.

<p>The city is built on very uneven ground, and the streets run in parallel lines. The most important square is the Plaza Mayor, on the southern side of which is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, on the eastern the city ball, and on the western the government house. The square was turned into a beautiful garden by <a href="../cathen/06379b.htm">President Garcia Moreno</a>, who was assassinated here 6 Aug., 1875. Quito is remarkable for its many beautiful churches, especially the old seventeenth-century <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Church of Santa Ana, <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, La Merced, and El Sagrario. The present <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which was founded by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> and Philip II in 1586, but opened only in 1621 by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, still occupies a portion of the old <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> and has an excellent <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, formed in part from that of the San Luis <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. There are 32 professors and 216 students. The observatory was erected under the direction of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> Father Menten. <a href="../cathen/06379b.htm">Garc&iacute;a Moreno</a> invited the German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to lecture in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; they have since been expelled by the <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Masonic</a> parties. The College of St. Ferdinand contains a tablet with a Latin inscription commemorative of the French and Spanish mathematicians who measured the degree of the meridian here in 1736-41. The chief manufactures of the city are woollens, laces, rugs, carpets, and tobacco. There is also a large export trade in religious oil-paintings.

<p>The Diocese of Quito was erected by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> on 8 Jan., 1545, at the request of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, and made suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Mgr. Garcidia, who died in 1563. In 1853 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> proceeded to the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of <a href="../cathen/09753b.htm">Maria Ana de Jes&ugrave; de Paredes y Flores</a>, the "Lily of Quito" (b. 31 Oct., 1618; d. 26 May, 1645). By the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Nos semper Romanis Pontificibus" of 13 Jan., 1848, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> made Quito a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, with the Dioceses of Cuenca and <a href="../cathen/07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a> as suffragans, to which have since been added the Sees of <a href="../cathen/07613c.htm">Ibarra</a>, Riobambo, <a href="../cathen/09332b.htm">Loja</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12294a.htm">Portoviejo</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Mgr Francisco Xavier de Garaycos, previously <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a>, was appointed 5 Sept., 1851. The present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Mgr Gons&aacute;lez y Francisco Su&aacute;rez, was born at Quito 2 Jan., 1845; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07613c.htm">Ibarra</a>, 30 July, 1895; transferred to Quito, 14 Dec., 1905, and entered into possession on 6 July, 1906, succeeding Mgr Pedro Rafael Gons&aacute;lez (b. at Quito, 14 Oct., 1839; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07613c.htm">Ibarra</a>, 29 Sept., 1876; coadjutor titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Synnade, 15 June, 1893, succeeding to the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> in Aug., 1893). The Archdiocese of Quito includes the provinces of Pichincha, Le&eacute;n, and Tunguragua, and contains 81 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 195 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 420,560 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> is in care of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>.
