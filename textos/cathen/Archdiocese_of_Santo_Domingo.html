<h1>Archdiocese of Santo Domingo</h1>  

<p>(SANCTI DOMINICI)

<p>Erected on 8 August, 1511, by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> who by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Pontifex Romanus" on that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> established also the Sees of <a href="../cathen/04190b.htm">Concepci&oacute;n</a> de la Vega and of <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a> of Porto Rico. Three <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, who had been appointed to the sees comprising the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> created previously (1504) by the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>, united their petition to that of the Crown in requesting the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (see <a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">PORTO RICO</a>) to suppress the same and to establish the three new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> as suffragans to the See of Seville. This alteration was effected before any one of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> in question had taken possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> or had received <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Father Francisco Garcia de Padilla, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, who had been in 1504 the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> designed to occupy the See of Bayuna (Baynoa, Baiunensis), on the extinction of the same was chosen the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Santo Domingo, having been so mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of the erection of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He died before his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, after having named Rev. Carlos de Arag&oacute;n his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and having authorized him to take possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who never reached America. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to occupy the See of Santo Domingo was Alessandro Geraldini, appointed in 1516 and died in 1524. He was a native of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and perhaps the only representative of all America to assist at the <a href="../cathen/09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> on 12 Feb., 1545, elevated Santo Domingo to the rank of an archdiocese, the incumbent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at the time, Bishop Alonso de Fuenmayor, becoming the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Santo Domingo as the first <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of America, according to the terms of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of erection "Super Universas Orbis Ecclesias", had five suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, as follows: San Juan in <a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a>, Santiago in <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, Coro in <a href="../cathen/15327a.htm">Venezuela</a>, Santa Marta of <a href="../cathen/03384b.htm">Cartagena</a>, and Trujillo in <a href="../cathen/07449b.htm">Honduras</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04190b.htm">Diocese of Concepci&oacute;n</a> de la Vega had been united, after the death of its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Pedro Francisco Su&aacute;rez de Deza, to the See of Santo Domingo by Apostolic authority. Nothing in the text of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of erection would warrant the use of the title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of the Indies by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of this see, although it remains indisputable that it is the first <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of all America. Santo Domingo is equally entitled to be called the cradle of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in America, being the centre of the religious and missionary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> that radiated thence to the adjoining islands and mainland. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 24 June, 1493, designated the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Father Buil (Boil) to accompany <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> on his second voyage of discovery, with ample faculties as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> or vicar, and to bring to the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> a body of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionaries. The unfortunate incident which deprived America of his services doubtless marred the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the beginning. But on 30 August, 1495, a band of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and other missioners arrived in Hispaniola to replace a discontented element that occasioned no small annoyance to the great discoverer, and to lay the solid foundation of the Faith among the native Indians.

<p>The archdiocese contains 600,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 66 secular and 12 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; 32 Sisters of Charity; 68 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; 103 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; 257 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Mgr Adolfo Nouel, was born at Santo Domingo, 12 December, 1862; elected titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10243b.htm">Methymna</a>, 8 October, 1904; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> eight days later as coadjutor to Archbishop de Merino of Santo Domingo, whom he succeeded in August, 1906.
