<h1>Archdiocese of Scutari</h1>  

<p>(SCUTARENSIS)

<p>The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Bassus (387). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Scutari were at first subject to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Salonica</a>, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of all Illyricum, but when Justinian I transferred the primacy to <a href="../cathen/01103b.htm">Achrida</a>, they became suffragans of the latter see. In the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Scutari was suffragan of <a href="../cathen/05007a.htm">Dioclea</a>. From the seventh to the middle of the twelfth century no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is known. Among its best-known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are: Francis II de Sanctis (1471-1491); Fra Dominicus Andrijasevic (died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1639), a famous <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, friend of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>; Dominicus II Babic (1677-1686); Antonius III de Nigris (1693-1702), <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 1702 by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. In 1867 Scutari was <em>que principaliter</em> united with the <a href="../cathen/01582b.htm">Archdiocese of Antivari</a>, and in this way <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> made Scutari an archdiocese and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the united diocese, Mgr. Charles Pooten, native of Teveran near <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, who had been Apostolic Administrator of <a href="../cathen/01582b.htm">Antivari</a> (1834-1855), died at Scutari on 15 January, 1886. From 1063 to 1886 only 53 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Scutari are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. On 23 October, 1886, the Archdiocese of Scutari was separated from that of <a href="../cathen/01582b.htm">Antivari</a>, and remained an archdiocese and a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> with three suffragans: Alessio, <a href="../cathen/13467b.htm">Sappa</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12561b.htm">Pulati</a>. The ancient See of Ulcinium, in the territory of Scutari, was in 1571 occupied by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and ceased to exist, for no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> remained. During the existence of Ulcinium, its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were suffragans of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/01582b.htm">Antivari</a> or of that of <a href="../cathen/05007a.htm">Dioclea</a>. About the middle of the sixteenth century the ancient See of Suacium was forever suppressed. Other ancient sees in this territory were the Sees of Dinnastrum and Balazum.

<p>The Archdiocese of Scutari comprises 29 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, of which 8 are held by <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and has a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of about 33,807. Its present <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> is Mgr. Paschalis Guerini, born at Pezzagno in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, 21 May, 1821; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 27 June, 1848; appointed Coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Scutari and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11457b.htm">Paphos</a> on 6 May, 1879; elected as Metropolitan and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Scutari on 23 November, 1886. The episcopal residence is at Scutari. The Archdiocese of Scutari has a Collegium Pontificium Albaniense founded as a central <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1853) by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Burned and again destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, it was reopened in 1859, the Emperor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Francis Joseph I, bearing two-thirds of the expense. The <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government supported at first fifteen seminarians, now twenty-four; <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> supports ten; the remaining eleven are at the charge of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. It is administered by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. A preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, the Collegium S. Francisci Xaverii, was opened in 1841 by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, to which in 1868, by the wish of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, a course of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was added and later a trade-school (<em>Handelsschule</em>). The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> have a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> or so-called <em>probandat</em> at Scutari and a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Rubigo. The Scolopii have an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for boys, and there is also an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for poor girls. There are <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and four <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> have hospices at Arramadhe-Scutari and at Kastrati, and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Scutari. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges are sustained mostly by the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government.
