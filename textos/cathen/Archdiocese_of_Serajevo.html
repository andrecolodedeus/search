<h1>Archdiocese of Serajevo</h1>  

<p>(SERAIUM).

<p>The healthy growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Bosnia was blighted and stunted by <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and the disturbances caused by the wandering of the nations. Irreparable, however, was the damage inflicted by the Oriental Schism. To this day forty-three per cent of the population are Greek Orthodox, calling themselves <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, and their religion and language Servian. From the earliest times the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Christ opposed the Bogomiles, a branch of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, who, varying as to time and place, dress, and nomenclature, are well nigh a historical puzzle. They have been called <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a>, Phundaites, <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionites</a>, Christopolites, and, after a certain <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Bogomiles. They were very numerous in Bosnia, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the great number of Bogomile graves. From 1292 onwards the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> co-operated with the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> in attending to the needs of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.

<p>When in 1463 Stephan Tomasevie, the last native sovereign of <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia</a>, was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and decapitated, there were many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who in order to save their possessions, renounced their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and became <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> (now known as "Begs"). Nearly all the Bogomiles became <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> at the same time, and the few who remained true to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were degraded to the position of "rayahs", i.e. serfs possessing no civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Bosnia suffered the most severe of hardships during the succeeding four centuries. The faithful lost their possessions, and might not, without the Sultan's permission, build themselves a hut, let alone a church. From 1683 onwards, repeated inhuman oppressions drove them frequently to have recourse to arms, but each time only to make their position worse than before. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Friars alone saved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Bosnia. They disguised themselves as <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and were addressed by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as <em>ujaci</em> (uncle). Often they were compelled to hold services and to bury their dead at night in the woods or in caves. They lived in the direst poverty and very many of them became <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The old people instructed the younger generation during the winter months in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, and during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> examined the pupils. Nearly all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Bosnia bore a cross tattooed on breast or hand.

<p>The subjection of the Bosnian people to the House of Habsburg marks the beginning of its growth in religion and in culture. In 1878 the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> powers charged <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> with the military government of <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, and in 1908 these two countries were declared part of the empire. In 1881 His Apostolic Majesty formed the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Serajevo, and appointed as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> <a href="../cathen/14240a.htm">J. Stadler</a>, professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Agram</a>. Native <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were elevated to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of Mostar and Banjalika. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> took over and has retained charge of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in Serajevo, which supplies the entire province, and in Travnik conducts a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys, the gymnasium of which is frequented by pupils of all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> maintain two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of six classes each for the preparation of the young <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> of the order, while the Sisters of Charity conduct 32 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>The Archdiocese of Serajevo has 180,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with 50 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 110 friars.
