<h1>Archdiocese of Urbino</h1>  

<p>(URBINATENSIS)

<p>Province of <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a> and Urbino, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city of Urbino is situated on a hill between the valleys of the Metaurus and Foglia, in a mountainous but well-cultivated country. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, near the ducal palace, was designed by Count Federico da Montefeltre; but was completely transformed in the nineteenth century, as the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> added in the sixteenth century and a large portion of the edifice were ruined in 1789. Some valuable pictures are still preserved there, a "Last Supper" and a "San Sebastiano of Barocci" in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, the "Scourging" by Pier della Francesca, in the oratory of the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> a "Piet&agrave;" of <a href="../cathen/02641a.htm">Giovanni da Bologna</a>. Other churches; S. Francesco (completed in 1350), partly Roman, partly Gothic, contains exquisite <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of Constantino Trappola, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Barocci, Procaccini, and others. S. Dominico (1365), originally Gothic, but completely transformed in 1732; over the main door is a high relief of <a href="../cathen/13095b.htm">Lucca della Robbia</a>. S. Agostino was also Gothic. The frescoes in the oratory of S. Giovanni Battista by Jacopo and Lorenzo <a href="../cathen/13452a.htm">Sanseverino</a>, including a "Crucifixion", are important in the history of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>: S. Spirito (standards of <a href="../cathen/13787a.htm">Luca Signorelli</a>), S. Bernardino (<a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a>), S. Giuseppe (Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, a relief by Brandini). The ducal palace was erected by Duke Federico, with Luciano di Laurana (1447) as architect; illustrious <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a> and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> were engaged to adorn it, but many of their works are now in foreign museums. Among those remaining are the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Duke Federico; the carvings on the edges of the doors, windows, and chimney-pieces; <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Margaritone, Antonio da Ferrara ("Crucifixion", "Baptism of Christ"), <a href="../cathen/15117c.htm">Paolo Uccello</a> ("Profanation of the Host"), Giusto di Grand ("Last Supper"), Giovanni Santi, <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> father ("Timoteo Viti"); <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a> ("Resurrection"). The duke's study, with its magnificent inlaid door and its ceiling, contains two <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>. The Castracane palace has an important collection of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. Urbino has a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with faculties of law, mathematico-physics, and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of pharmacy and obstetrics, and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> founded in 1265. Urbino is the native place of Bartolommeo Carusi, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and professor at Bologna and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Federico Commandini (1509), mathematician; Bernardini Baldi (seventeenth century), poet; Ludovio della Vernaccia (thirteenth century), poet; Laura Battiferri-Ammanati (seventeenth century), poet; the archeologist, Mgr. Fabretti (1619); the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raffaello Sanzio</a> and Federico Barocci; <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a> and Genga, father and son, architects; the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, Federico Brandani, and <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>.

<p>Urbino is the ancient Urbinum Mataurense, a Roman <em>municipium</em>. The city and its environs are rich in inscriptions, one of which is certainly <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">Christian</a>. Urbino was held by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, but was captured by Belisarius (538). Under Pepin it became part of the pontifical domain. By the eleventh century it had a commune. Becoming the capital of the counts of Montefeltre, it increased in importance. In 1213 Bonconte di Montefeltro was elected <em>podest&agrave;</em> of Urbino. The Urbinese rebelled, formed an alliance with the commune of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> (1228), and by 1234 were masters of the city. He and his descendants were leaders of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a> of the Marches and the Romagna. Montefeltrano succeeded (1214-55), and Guido (1255-86 and 1293-6). <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> absolved him from censures and employed him against <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a> and the Colonna. Federico I (1296-1322) increased his domains by taking from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> Fano, <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a>, <a href="../cathen/12675a.htm">Recanati</a>, <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>. His exorbitant taxes led to his <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and the city recognized the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy. But in 1323 his son Nolfo (1323-59) was proclaimed lord of Urbino. In 1355, on the coming of Cardinal Albornoz, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sovereignty was again recognized, but not without loss of territory. Federico II was entirely despoiled. His son, Antonio (1377-1403), profited by the rebellion of the Marches and Umbria against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy see</a> (1375) to restore his authority in Urbino. Guido Antonio (1403-43) was appointed by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1419) ruler of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, and carried on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Braccio di Montone with varying fortune. Oddo Antonio, after a few months' government, was assassinated for his crimes. The Urbanese then offered the lordship to Federico III (1444-82), the <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son of Guido Antonio, a pupil of Vittorino da Feltre's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and a lover of art. Under him Urbino became the resort of the brightest minds of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. He was implicated in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Sigismondo Malatesta</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Rene of Anjou, and Florence. <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> conferred on him the title of Duke of Urbino (1474). Guidubaldo I (1492-1508) escaped by flight the plots of Caesar Borgia. He adopted Francesco Maria della Rovere (1508-38), his sister's child, and thus the <em>signoria</em> of <a href="../cathen/14013a.htm">Sinigaglia</a> was united to Urbino. He aided <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> in reconquering the Romagna. <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> deprived him of his territory, which was given to Lorenzo de' Medici, and later to Giovanni Maria Varano (1516-21). On Leo's death Federico III reascended the throne. The internal government was almost entirely in the hands of duchess Eleonora Gonzaga. Guidubaldo II (1538-74), by his marriage with Giullia di Varano, obtained the Ducy of <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a>, which he had to cede in 1539 to <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> for 60,000 <em>scudi</em>. In 1572 the Urbinese rebelled against taxation, but were suppressed. Francesco Maria II (1574-1631) endeavoured to reduce the taxes imposed by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. In 1606 and 1626 he withdrew from the government to study natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and appointed a commission of eight to rule. On the assassination of his only son, Federico Ubaldo, in 1624, he placed his domains under the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Urbino is Leontius, to whom <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> entrusted the <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Diocese of Rimini</a> (592). Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Theodoricus, who in 1021 transferred the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> within the city (the ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was outside); Blessed Mainardo (1057). Under Bishops Egidio (1288) and Carrado, O. S. A. (1309), Blessed Pelnigotto, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Tertiary and <a href="../cathen/04007a.htm">Blessed Clare of Rimini</a> lived in the city. Marco Boncioni, O. P. (1342); Fra Bartolommeo Carusi, O. S. A. (1347), <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Under Francesco, O. Min. (1379), the hermitage of the Gerolamini on Monte Cesana was established; Oddone Colonna (1380), later <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>; Gian Pietro Arrivabeni (1491), learned writer and restorer of discipline; Cardinal Gregorio Cortese, O. S. B. (1542); Felice Tiranni (1551), reformer of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. In 1563 <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> made the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, with the suffragans, Cagli, <a href="../cathen/14013a.htm">Sinigaglia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>, Forssombrone, <a href="../cathen/10528a.htm">Montefeltro</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>. Under Antonio Giannotti (1578) the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was opened; Ascanio Maffei (1646) restored many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Ignazio Ranaldi, oratorian (1819), restored the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdiocese</a> has now, as suffragans, S. Angelo in Vado, Cagli, and Pergola, Fossambrone, <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>, Senigallia; it contains 99 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 32,600 inhabitants; 130 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> priests; 1 house of religious (men); 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 4 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for boys and 2 for girls.
