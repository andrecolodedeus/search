<h1>Archdiocese of Utrecht</h1>  

<p>Situated in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, includes the Provinces of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, Friesland, Overyssel, Drenthe, Groningen, the larger part of Gelderland, and a small part of North <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. In 1911 the archdiocese contained 17 deaneries, 282 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 578 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 390 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and 383,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and 8 canons; the Government has no part in the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> is divided into two sections: one at Driebergen with five professors, the other at Culenberg with twelve. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations are: Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, Brothers of Mercy, Brothers of Our Lady of the Sacred heart, and <a href="../cathen/02802b.htm">Brothers of St. John of God</a>, with altogether 15 houses; Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy, Tertiaries of St. Francis, Tertiaries of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">St. Dominic</a>, Sisters of Konigsbusch, Sisters of the Society of Jesus of <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a>, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Nuns of the Perpetual Adoration, <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo</a>, Sisters of the Good Shepherd, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Nuns of the Strict Observance, Daughters of Mary and Joseph, Sorores Matris Boni Succursus, Poor Sisters of the Child Jesus, Poor School Sisters, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Nuns; altogether about 80 houses. The principal church of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Catherine, built in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style in 1524; the former <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Martin, built 1251-67 in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, now belongs to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>.

<p>The founding of the Diocese of Utrecht dates back to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> era. In 695 <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Frisians. Towards the close of the seventh century, with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king, he settled at the market-town of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> and built two churches there, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Saviour, and that of St. Martin. The conversion of the Frisians to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, though, progressed very slowly. After Willibrord's death <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> repeatedly gave his attention to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> without, however, being its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Under the guidance of his friend St. Gregory, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a> became a noted centre of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for the northern part of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom. During the early years of its existence the diocese suffered greatly from the incursions of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Frisians, and in the ninth and tenth centuries from the plundering expeditions of the Normans, who traversed the territory robbing and burning as they went. Better times appeared during the supremacy of the Saxon emperors, who esteemed the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> highly, and frequently summoned them to attend the imperial councils and diets. Through the grants of land and privileges bestowed by these emperors the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> became secular princes, and were among the most powerful <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lords of the north-western part of the empire. In this way, like the other German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, they became involved in the quarrels of the emperors and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Bishop William (1057-76) was an unswerving partisan of the <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a> during the Strife of Investitures. He took part in the synod of Worms which pronounced the deposition of Pope Gregory VII, and signed the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of deposition directly after the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. His successor Konrad (1078-99) was also a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> adherent of the emperor. The Concordat of Worms (1122) annulled the emperor's right of investiture, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter received the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the free election of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It was, however, soon obligated to share this right with the four other collegiate chapters which existed in the city of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. The Counts of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and Geldern, between whose territories the lands of the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> lay, also sought to acquire influence over the filling of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. This often led to disputes at the election of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and it was but seldom that capable and worthy men gained the See of <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> frequently interfered in the election, and after the middle of the fourteenth century repeatedly appointed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> directly without regard to the five chapters.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Great Schism of the West</a> in the latter quarter of the fourteenth century also affected the Diocese of Utrecht. Bishop Arnold II of Horn (1371-78) was opposed by a rival <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Floris of Wevelinkhofen (1378-93). The latter was generally recognized when Arnold, in return for a large sum of money, renounced his claims to Utrecht, and was raised to the See of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. During the episcopate of Floris, Gerhard Groote, who traversed the diocese as a preacher of repentance, was very successful in his efforts to bring about reforms. Floris was succeeded by one of the best <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, Frederick of Blankenheim (1392-1423). Frederick's excellent administration was followed by a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> that lasted twenty-five years. <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a> would not recognize Rudolph of Diepholz (1423-55), who had been elected by the chapters, and appointed Rabanus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and, after his resignation, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, Zweder of Culenberg. After Zweder's death in 1433 his brother, Walraf of Mors, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugene IV</a>. As the neighbouring secular rulers took part in the quarrel over the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the country suffered terribly until the general recognition of Rudolph put an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. After his death the chapters elected Gijsbrecht of Brederode, but Philip of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> was able to obtain at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the appointment of his <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son David. During the entire period of his episcopate David (1457-94) maintained himself with difficulty against his enemies, namely the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the city of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. He was succeeded by Frederick of Baden (1496-1516) a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Maximilian of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and Philip of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> (1518-24), who did much for the encouragement of art and to improve church discipline. Henry of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1524-28) who was also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Freising and Worms, resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1528 with the consent of the chapter, and transferred his <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a> to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, who was also Duke of Brabant and Count of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. Thus Utrecht came under the sovereignty of the Hapsburgs; the chapters <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> transferred their right of electing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Pope Clement VII</a> gave his consent to the proceeding. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appointed by Charles, Cardinal William Enckevorst, died in 1533 without having ever entered his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>In 1550 at the instance of Philip II, the church organization of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> was entirely changed by forming new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and reorganizing the old ones. Utrecht was taken from Cologne, of which it had been a suffragan, and raised to the rank of an archdiocese and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>. Its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were Haarlem, <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a>, Middleburg, Deventer, Leeuwarden, and Groningen. But the new <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> had not a long existence. During the administration of the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Frederick Schenk of Toutenberg (1561-80), <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> spread rapidly, especially among the nobility, who viewed with disfavour the endowment of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> with the ancient and wealthy <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. When the northern provinces of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> revolted, the archdiocese fell, with the overthrow of the Spanish power. As early as 1573, under the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, the public exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was forbidden. Proof of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> suffered is given by the death of the nineteen <a href="../cathen/06651c.htm">martyrs of Gorkum</a>. The two successors appointed by <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> did not receive canonical confirmation, neither could they enter their diocese on account of the opposition of the States-General. From the end of the sixteenth century their place was taken by <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> for the United <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, who, however, were generally driven from the country by the States-General and forced to administer their charge from abroad. Although, in addition to this, there was a great lack of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, still a very large part of the population of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> remained loyal to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. Among these <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, who were generally made titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, was John of Neercassel (1662-86), a friend of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> Arnold and <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, who had fled from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and was inclined to <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> himself. His successor, Petrus Cobde (1688-1704), was suspended in 1702 by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> on account of his <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> opinions and his stubborn opposition to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a>, and in 1704 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> deposed him. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, though, illegally elected first a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (1706), then in 1723 with the approval of the States-General chose the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, Cornelius Steenhoven, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Steenhoven was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Pope Benedict XIII</a>. This was the origin of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, which, however, was joined by only a very small part of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, although the state favoured it entirely. As the pro-vicars appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were not permitted by the Government to enter the country, both the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> and that of the entire <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> was administered until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> internuncios of Cologne and <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>.

<p>Owing to the occupation of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> by the French in 1795, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> obtained somewhat more freedom. Still, there was no proper organization of church affairs, not even after the uniting of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> with <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> by the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1815. The concordat made with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1827 was not carried out. In 1833 a vicar for the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> was appointed once more. The Constitutions of 1848 granted the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at last complete parity with the other confessions, and gave the church authorities almost unlimited freedom in purely religious matters and in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could now plan the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. After long negotiations the most essential regulations of the Concordat of 1827 were put into force. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex qua die" of 4 March, 1853, organized the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> anew. Utrecht was raised once more to an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, and received the four suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/07095a.htm">Haarlem</a>, <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a>, <a href="../cathen/02752a.htm">Breda</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13110a.htm">Roermond</a>. John Zaijsen was appointed the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>; as administrator he also ruled the Diocese of Bois-le-Duc. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> took up with great energy and caution the organization of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the division into deaneries, the settling of the boundaries of the individual <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The administration of the lands of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, of the lands of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the management of the benevolent institutions. By numerous excellent decrees he provided for the improvement of church discipline, for the encouragement of orders and of church associations, for the training of a competent <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (1857, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was opened), for the establishment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> independent of the State, for the improvement of the Press, etc. In 1858 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were organized and in 1864 the first provincial synod was held. In 1868 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> resigned the archdiocese on account of age, retaining only the direction of the Diocese of Bois-le-Duc. His successors were Andreas Ignatius Schaepman (1868-82), during whose administration the large <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> museum was established; Petrus Matthias Snickers (1883-95), and Henry van de Wetering (since 1895).
