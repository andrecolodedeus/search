<h1>Archdiocese of Valladolid</h1>  

<p>(VALLISOLETANA).

<p>Bounded on the north by Palencia, east by <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> and Segovia, south by Avila and Salamanca, and west by Zamora. Excepting two towns, it comprises the civil Province of Valladolid, and has in its territory six towns which are alternately one year under its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and the next under that of the <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Diocese of Avila</a>. Its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are <a href="../cathen/02018d.htm">Astorga</a>, <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, Salamanca, <a href="../cathen/15747c.htm">Zamora</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03793d.htm">Ciudad Real</a>. Valladolid (60,000) is built on the site of an ancient Roman city, and remains of Roman ruins are to be found, but it does not seem to be the Pintia which Antoninus says was 106 miles from <a href="../cathen/02018d.htm">Astorga</a>. Probably it was founded by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and given the name of Ulid or Walid. The first mention of it is found in the "Cronica de Carde&ntilde;a" as one of the towns which Sancho II offered to his sister Do&ntilde;a Urraca in exchange for Zamora, the seigniory of which had been conferred upon her by her father. The real founder of Valladolid was the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> Count Ans&uacute;rez to whom Alfonso VI ceded it in 1074. He built the churches of Santa Mar&iacute;a la Antigua and Santa Mar&iacute;a la Mayor, founded the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of San Nicolas, but he seems to have found already existing the churches of San Juli&aacute;n and San Pelayo. He built he great bridge over the Pisuerga and two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> near his own palace. On 21 May, 1095, the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">Church</a> of Santa Mar&iacute;a la Mayor was dedicated by D. Bernado, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo, assisted by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, and many other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and noted personages. Ansurez and his wife Eylo conferred vast territories upon the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and chapter of the collegiate church, for purposes of colonization. This grant consisted of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of San Julian and San Pelayo, lands in Tierra de Campos, and a great stretch of land between the branches of the River Esgueva.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Valladolid in the twelfth century were Saltus or Agaldus; Hervaeus; Pedro; Mart&iacute;n; Juan; Miguel; and Domingo; in the thirteenth, Juan Dom&iacute;nguez, counsellor of St. Ferdinand; D. Felipe, son of St. Ferdinand; D. Sancho de <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, son of Jaime I; D. Mart&iacute;n Alonso, <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son of Alfonso the Wise; and G&oacute;mez Garc&iacute;a of Toledo; in the fourteenth, Juan Fern&aacute;ndez de Limia, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Santiago; and Fernando Alvarez de Albornoz, cousin of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; in the fifteenth, Diego G&oacute;mez de Fuensalida; Cardinal Pedro de Fonseca; the famous Alfonso de Madrigal, called "el Tostado", Cardinal Fr. Juan de Torquemada; Cardinal D. Pedro de Mendoza; and in the sixteenth century, D. Fernando Enr&iacute;quez, son of the admiral, D. Alfonso Enriquez Villarroel; and D. Alfonso de Mendoza. In 1124, with the assistance of the Cardinal <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Adeodatus, a council of all the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the kingdom was held at Valladolid, and in 1137 another, presided over by Cardinal Guido. On 1 July, 1217, <a href="../cathen/06042a.htm">St. Ferdinand III</a> was proclaimed king in this city, on the abdication of his mother Do&ntilde;a Berenguela.

<p>In 1238 another council was held, over which the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sabina presided. In order to terminate the disputes with Palencia, Philip II, who was born at Valladolid, wished to have it constituted a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> erected it on 25 Sept., 1595, and the king conferred on it a city charter. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was D. Bartolom&eacute; de la Plaza, 1597, and among his successors D. Martin Delgado Cenarro (1743-53) deserves mention. By the Concordat of 1851 the elevation of Valladolid to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> was stipulated, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> at the request of Isabella II issued the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> for its erection on 4 July, 1857. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was D. Luis de Lastra y Cuesta, and his successors were Cardinal Juan Ignacio Moreno, Cardinal Benito Sanz y Fores, and the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who has just been raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> dignity, D. Jos&eacute; Cos y Macho. Many noted events have taken place at Valladolid: the marriage of Alfonso X and Dona Violante de <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> and that of Alfonso XI to Dona Constanza; <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> died there; and D. Alvaro de Luna was decapitated. The first <em>auto da fe</em> of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Spanish Inquisition</a> was carried out at Valladolid, and the Cortes met there many times. The city owes much to the famous Dona Mar&iacute;a de Molina, wife of Sancho the Brave, regent during the minorities of Ferdinand IV and Alfonso Xi. The latter conferred many distinctions upon Valladolid and gave it its <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The Court resided several times at Valladolid, the last time from 1601 to 1606 by wish of Philip III, who was much attached to the city.
<h2>Churches</h2>

<p>Santa Mar&iacute;a la Antigua was the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of the counts of Valladolid and was in existence as early as 1088. Behind the modern <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> are the remains of the ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Santa Mar&iacute;a la Mayor, not as founded by the Conde Ans&uacute;rez, but as restored a century and a half later. Bishop Lucas of <a href="../cathen/15105a.htm">Tuy</a> says that the Abbot Juan, chancellor of St. Ferdinand, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11339a.htm">Osma</a>, rebuilt and redecorated it, transferring the chapter meanwhile to Santa Mar&iacute;a la Antigua (1226). Its architecture is of the Transition period. Antol&iacute;nez de <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, who lived in the sixteenth century, describes with enthusiasm its magnificent <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was erected, Philip II engaged Juan de Herrera, the famous architect of the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>, to make the plans of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Herrera began the construction, but was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go back to the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>, and was succeeded by D. Alberto da <em>Churriguera</em>, from whom the Spanish style of architecture Churrigueresco (Baroque) takes its name. Notwithstanding this, the influence of Herrera can be traced in the exterior. The principal <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> has four Doric half columns, which support the <a href="../cathen/05479b.htm">entablature</a> of the first story; between each column rises a magnificent arch overhanging a rectangular door over which is placed the figure of the Assumption, the titular of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In the inter- columnar spaces are <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul, and a door at each side. Two towers were to have finished the principal fafacadeccedil;ade; of these one was never built beyond the firs story, and the other which was finished collapsed in 1841. The interior is imposing; along the top is an open gallery finished with a balustrade. The tabernacle built by Juan de Arfe (1590) and the choir stalls, which were brought from the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church, are two of the precious possessions of this <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Convent of San Pablo, founded in 1276 by Do&ntilde;a Violante, wife of Alfonso X, the Wise, deserves special mention. Juan II lived there, and was temporarily buried there until his remains could be transferred to the Cartuja de Miraflores. It is a Gothic building, the most notable feature of which is the fafacadeccedil;ade of its church, built at the expense of Cardinal Juan de Torquemada and Fr. Alonso de <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a>. Beside it is the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> College of San Gregorio, founded in 1488 by Fr. Alonso de <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, confessor of <a href="../cathen/08177a.htm">Isabella the Catholic</a>. The famous <a href="../cathen/09385b.htm">Luis de Granada</a> studied there. Its fafacadeccedil;ade is the best of its kind on account of its original designs. Its <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, with a double gallery, is also notable. The ancient College of Santa Cruz, founded by Cardinal Mendoza, a building in the plateresque style, has been converted into a museum, and contains many beautiful samples of religious <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a>. The ancient <em>palacio real</em> serves as a court building. This has a beautiful fafacadeccedil;ade, with a tower at each side, and finished with a <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnade</a> of alternating arches having square openings. The episcopal palace is a handsome building, and the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, founded by D. Bartolom&eacute; de la Plaza in 1597 and rebuilt in 1847 by D. Jos&eacute; Antonio Ribadeneyra, was made a pontifical <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1897.

<p>Valladolid has secondary and normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, archaeological and art museums, and a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of 30,000 volumes. The Spanish cavalry <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is situated here also. Among the charitable establishments may be mentioned the Hospital de la Resurrecci&oacute;n; the military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, formerly a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> de Esgueva; the Casa de Misericordia, occupying the ancient palace of the counts of Benavente; the asylums for <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicants</a>.
