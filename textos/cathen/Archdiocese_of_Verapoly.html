<h1>Archdiocese of Verapoly</h1>  

<p>(VERAPOLITANA.)

<p>Located on the Malabar Coast, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, having the <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Diocese of Quilon</a> as suffragan; extends northwards to the River Ponany, southwards to the Rani River, bounded on the east by the Ghaut line and on the west by the Indian Ocean. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population within the confines of the archdiocese is divided into two parts-those of the Syrian Rite, called <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Thomas Christians</a>, who are under the personal (and quasi-territorial) <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the three Vicars Apostolic of Trichur, <a href="../cathen/16038a.htm">Ernakulam</a>, and Changancherry; and those of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, originally converts of the Portuguese missionaries, who are territorially under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. These later form a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 75,389, having 31 churches and 25 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, served by 25 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Order</a> (mostly <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>), about 40 native <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, and of the Syrian Rite. There are besides in <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">monastic enclosure</a> 10 <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Fathers of the First Order and 12 of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>, making a total of about 90 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Also 19 <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Nuns of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>, 6 Brothers of St. Teresa, and 15 catechists. Candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> are sent partly to St. Joseph's Central Seminary, Puttenpally, under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Fathers, and partly to Kandy. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> present residence is at <a href="../cathen/16038a.htm">Ernakulam</a> in the Cochin State, but the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is at Verapoly.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>This district was occupied in the first instance by a large community of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> claiming to have been converted by St. Thomas the Apostle, and using a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> Rite. These were brought under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> after the Synod of Diamper in 1599, and ruled by <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> at Angamal&eacute;, and afterwards at Cranganore. After a few years, there arose a factional dispute which led to a revolt of practically the whole community. <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> missionaries were sent by <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> in 1637 to bring about a reconciliation between the people and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; but failing this they managed at least to bring the majority of them into <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity under their own rule. Thereupon the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> (under <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>) were placed in full charge of the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Syrian Christians</a>, while those of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, who had been converted by Portuguese missionaries, were attached to the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> in 1663 drove the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> out of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> extended their care to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> territory. After 1700 the See of Cranganore acquired once more the allegiance of a certain portion of the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Syrian Christians</a> &#151; the rest, with the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Christians</a>, remaining under the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Verapoly or Malabar. During this time the lines between the two jurisdictions were practically indefinite, and the faithful passed freely from one side to the other. In more recent times the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> had, besides Malabar, active centres along the coast northwards up to Portuguese limits, including Mangalore and Carwar; and there was a free interchange of missionaries between the Malabar and the Bombay vicariates. In 1838 by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <em>Multa praeclare</em> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was totally withdrawn from the Portuguese Sees of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> and Cranganore, though in many places the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> still remained in possession and maintained their claims to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> as derived from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>.

<p>The Vicariate of Verapoly, which extended indefinitely even as far as Tanjore, was curtailed by dividing of the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a> in 1845, and the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/09588b.htm">Mangalore</a> in 183. Further retrenchments occurred when the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was established in 1886. By this act Verapoly was made into an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>; Quilon became a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>; the <em>padroado</em> <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a> was restored, but with limits much smaller than formerly; the next year the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Syrian Christians</a> were assigned to two new <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> at Kottayam and Trichur, who thus took the place of the suppressed See of Cranganore; and only Latin <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the remaining territory were left to form the Archdiocese of Verapoly.
