<h1>Archdiocese of Warsaw</h1>  

<p>(VARSAVIENSIS).

<p>Warsaw (Polish, <em>Warszawa</em>), on the western bank of the Vistula, is the capital of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The city, including the suburb of Praga on the east side of the Vistula, consists of the Old City (<em>Stare Miasto</em>), the New City (<em>Nowe Miasto</em>) and the westerly suburbs of Wola and Mokot&oacute;w. It is the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and also of the Russian Orthodox <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03645d.htm">Kholm</a> and Warsaw. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and is entitled to wear the red robes of a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> save the calotte and <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a>, but he may not now call himself <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, the Russian authorities allowing only "Archiepiscopus Ecclesiae Metropolitanae Varsoviensis". The city has fine handsome streets and is the chief industrial centre of western <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. In the central part of the city is the royal palace, now the official residence of the Russian governor-general, and also the magnificent avenues of Krakowskie Przedmiescie, Nowy Swiat, and Aleja Ujazdowska, which compare with those of any <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> cities, the new Orthodox Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky, and the fine park known as the Saxe Gardens, while to the north in the Old City is the historic <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. John and the frowning Alexander Citadel. The Jewish quarter lies to the north and west of the Saxe Gardens, commencing near the Zelazna Brama (Iron Gate), while to the south is the Lazienki Park with its chateau, formerly the royal summer palace. Two iron bridges span the Vistula to Praga, which is the actual railway terminus of Warsaw for trains from St. Petersburg, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, or southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Many of the finest collections of books, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and art treasures made by the kings of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and palaces of Warsaw have been confiscated by the Russian Government and removed to St. Petersburg. The most ancient documents which mention the city of Warsaw date from the end of the twelfth century; but the city probably existed earlier, perhaps in the eleventh century. It developed greatly during the reign of Trojden, who in the fourteenth century surrounded it with walls. In 1431 it began to be embellished with houses and palaces, and became the residence of the Dukes of Masovia. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it acquired great importance as the meeting-place of the Polish diets. In 1550 King Sigismund August chose it as a residence, and from the time of Sigismund III it was the capital. In 1815 it likewise became the capital of the Polish realm incorporated with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and bean a rapid commercial development. Its population has increased from 75,000 at the beginning of the nineteenth century to 781,179 in 1910, of whom more than 265,000 are Hebrews and about 30,000 Russians and 25,000 Germans. The city nevertheless preserves its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Polish character, and is the most important centre of Polish literature. The Diocese, or Archdiocese, of Warsaw is of comparatively recent origin, though <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has flourished there from the foundation of the city, ancient documents attesting the existence of a <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. George at Warsaw in 1195. Before the erection of its <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, it formed part of the archdiaconate of Czersk which was a portion of the Diocese of Posen as early as the twelfth century. In 1406 Adalbert Sastrzenbiec, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Posen, authorized the institution of a collegiate church at Warsaw and transferred the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Czerk there. In the sixteenth century the canons of Warsaw became a very important body, in which many nobles were included. In the seventeenth century the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Posen began the title of the Diocese of Posen with that of Warsaw. The Archdiaconate of Warsaw lasted until 1798 as an appendage of the Diocese of Posen &#151; an extremely large one, including as it did the whole district of Czersk with part of those of Warsaw, Blonic, Rabsk, Sochaczew, etc., numbering 144 churches at the end of the eighteenth century, exclusive of those belonging to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders.

<p>In 1793 Stanislaus Poniatowski, the last King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of setting up an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at Warsaw, but the political vicissitudes of the kingdom prevented the execution of this project. Frederick William II of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, having obtained possession of Warsaw in 1797, nominated Joseph Boncza Miaskowski, the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Posen, as its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> dated at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, October, 1798, <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> sanctioned the canonical erection of the Diocese of Warsaw, separating it from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Posen. The new diocese comprised within its limits the territory of the old archdiaconate &#151; the Deaneries of Garwolin, Liw, and Lascz&oacute;w. Its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr. Miakowski, died in 1804, when its government was entrusted to Ignatus Raczynski, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, who, in 1808, appointed Gregory Zacharjaszewicz, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04362a.htm">Corfu</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. The city was divided into four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. At his death (1814) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered by Francis Zambrzycki, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dardania. As a result of the concordat between <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and Alexander I, and the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Militantis ecclesiae" of 11 March, 1817, the Diocese of Warsaw was made an archdiocese. On 2 October, 1818, Francis Skarbek Malczewski was <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex imposita nobis", 30 June, 1818, was appointed Apostolic Legate for the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The diocese then comprised 19 deaneries, 278 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 432,929 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and a large number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. On the death of Malczewski, 18 April, 1819, Stephen de Holowczyce, a White Russian, was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, 17 December, 1819. On his death, 27 August, 1823, he was succeeded by Albert Leszczic Skarszewski (1824-27) and John Paul Pawenza Woronicz (1829-29). These first four <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> bore the title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Stanislaus Kostka Lubicz Choromanski (1837-38) was the first to take the title of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Warsaw. Under the disturbed conditions of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> between 1831 and 1837, the archdiocese was administered by two <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, Edward Czarnecki and Adam Paszkowicz. On the death of Choromanski it had two other administrators, Thomas Chielewski, suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Warsaw until 1844, and Anthony Melchior Fijalkowski, who was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> 11 January, 1857, and died in exile 5 October, 1861. On 26 January he was succeeded by Sigismund Szcensny Felinski, who, in consequence of the Polish insurrection of 14 June, 1863, was summoned to St. Petersburg and exiled to Yaroslaw. There he remained for twenty years, exercising a fruitful apostolate and writing his memoirs which are of great interest for the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. He resigned on 13 March, 1883, and died on 17 September, 1895. On 15 March of the same year Vincent Theophilus Chosciak Popicl was appointed his successor.



<p>The Archdiocese of Warsaw should have two suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, one for Lowicz, the other for Warsaw; but these two suffragans are rarely elected. The Diocese of Warsaw at present comprises the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter of Warsaw, with eleven canons, and the collegiate chapter of Lowicz, with seven canons. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into fourteen deaneries: Warsaw, with 12 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 25 churches or suburban <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> succursals; Brzeziny, 64,736 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 19 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Gostynin, 59,212 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 16 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Grodzisk, 91,958 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 18 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Grojec, 95472 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 30 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Kutno, 74,281 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 22 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Leczycz, 111438 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 32 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Lodz, 308,930 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 10 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Lowicz, 81,354 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 19 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Minsk, 88,472 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 20 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Radzymin, 69,279 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 13 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Rawa, 65,485 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 20 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Skierniewice, 43,687 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 13 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; Sochaczew, 54,968 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and 18 churches. There are 51 non-parochial churches. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> numbers 529 priests; the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is reduced to practically nothing, consisting only of a few religious who have survived since the closing of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in 1863, and some <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Nowe Miasto, thirteen in number, altogether 22 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 2 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. In 1906 five <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> took up their residence at Warsaw, but were expelled in 1909. Two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> exist at Warsaw; that of the Visitation, with 14 Sisters; that of the Perpetual Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, with 13 Sisters. At Szymanow there is a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, numbering 30 religious. On the other hand the Sisters of Charity, at Warsaw, Kutno, Lowicz, Leczyc, Rawa, Skierniewice, Grojec, etc., number 382; they have charge of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, almshouses, lunatic asylums, and sanatoria. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> has 10 professors and 122 students. In 1816 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Warsaw had a faculty of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; in 1825 it was transformed into a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of higher studies; in 1835 the Tsar Nicholas I made it a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> academy; but it was suppressed in 1867. The Diocese of Warsaw sends six or seven of its best students to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> of St. Petersburg.

<p>In the city of Warsaw the faithful number 414,620 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 1,412,652, making 1,827,272 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for the whole archdiocese. The city contains more than forty <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, most of which formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, dates from the thirteenth century; it contains many <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, works of art, and <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of illustrious Polish magnates; the famous <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/14034a.htm">Father Peter Skarga</a>, preached there. It is a church of much historical importance for the events which have taken place in it, and is a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, served by a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of vicars, with a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of 20,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The Augustinian Church of St. Martin, founded in the fourteenth century, has been since 1625 the seat of a very flourishing Confraternity of the Girdle; the religious were expelled from it in 1864. Next in order of importance are, among others; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Visitation of the Most Holy Mary, founded early in the fifteenth century, restored in 1829-41, with a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of 19,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; the Church of S. Ann of the <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a>, founded in the same century, where the mortal remains of Blessed Ladislaus of Gelniow are <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>; Holy Cross, built in the first half of the sixteenth century, and given in 1663 to the Missionaries of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>. The religious were expelled from it in 1864. It stands in the aristocratic quarter of the city, and has a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of 17,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Church of St. James was built in the seventeenth century by the famous church historian Abram Bzowski (Bzovius). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Spirit, the origin of which is said to date from the fourteenth century, was given to the Paulines in 1661, and in 1819 to the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Confraternity. St. Anthony, founded in the earlier half of the seventeenth century, was entrusted to the Reformed <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; it has been the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of 18,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> since 1864. The Assumption, built in the first half of the seventeenth century by the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, together with their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, became in 1865-67 the seat of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> academy, and is now occupied by the archdiocesan <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. St. Francis, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1646, is now the church of the military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. St. Mary, founded by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and completed in 1626, was afterwards given to the Paulines and <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>. The Transfiguration, formerly a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> church, founded by <a href="../cathen/14061c.htm">John Sobieski</a> to commemorate the deliverance of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, became in 1866 a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of 6000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Church of the Nativity, built in the sixteenth century, is now the church of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> with 42,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Most Holy Trinity</a>, Trinitarian, was begun in 1699; it now serves a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of 38,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Alexander, built by Tsar Alexander I in 1836, is magnificently adorned with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, but is not in favour with patriotic Poles. All Saints, a modern church, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1883, has a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of 60,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Our Lady of Loreto, in the popular suburb of Praga, has 82,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in its <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>.

<p>After Warsaw, the chief centre of population in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is Lodz, which has two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, the Assumption (92,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>) and the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (142,734 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>). Notwithstanding the unfavourable circumstances under which the Diocese of Warsaw exists, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> there is in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is vigorous among its inhabitants. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> is insufficient in number to supply the spiritual needs of the flock, and unfortunately the assistance of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is wanting. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> has to combat the corruption of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> fomented in a thousand ways by anti-Christian agencies; the anti-clerical propaganda of the Socialists and the <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">Freethinkers</a>, who have founded a periodical the "Mysl Niepodlegla" (Independent Thought), to defame religion and its <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>; the legal <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the Russian Government; lastly, the Mariavites, who are scattered throughout the Diocese of Warsaw. Lodz has now become the centre of Mariavitism; there, according to Mariavitist statistics, the adherents of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> numbered 40,000. Charitable works are highly developed at Warsaw, but it is regretted that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press is not as flourishing as it ought to be.
