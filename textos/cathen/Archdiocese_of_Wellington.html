<h1>Archdiocese of Wellington</h1>  

<p>(WELLINGTONIENSIS).

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a>, originally formed part of the Vicariate of Western Oceania erected by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1835. In 1836 New Zealand and the islands of the Western Pacific were entrusted by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> to the then newly-founded <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>, as a field for their missionary labours. Owing to the difficulty of communication at that time between the numerous islands forming the vicariate, it was thought that success could be better achieved by making New Zealand a separate vicariate. This was done in 1842, and Mgr. Pompallier was chosen to administer it as Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01380c.htm">Amasia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. Very soon the need was felt for a further division, as British colonists began to arrive in great numbers, once New Zealand was made a British colony. On 22 Jan., 1840, the first body of immigrants arrived and founded the town of Wellington. About the same time (29 Jan., 1840) the sovereignty of Queen Victoria over the Islands of New Zealand was proclaimed. A compact called the Treaty of Waitangi was entered into between the queen's representative and the prominent native chiefs, whereby all <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and powers of sovereignty were ceded to the queen, all territorial <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> being secured to the chiefs and their tribes. New Zealand was then constituted a dependency of New South Wales, but on 3 May, 1841, was proclaimed a separate colony. The colony (as it then was) was divided into two vicariates in 1843, the Province of <a href="../cathen/02068a.htm">Auckland</a> forming one vicariate, and Wellington, with the rest of the colony, the other. When the division of territory was made, Mgr. Philip Joseph Viard, who had for some time been acting as coadjutor to Mgr. Pompallier, became administrator of the Wellington vicariate, at the same time remaining coadjutor of <a href="../cathen/02068a.htm">Auckland</a>. By <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 3 July, 1860, he ceased to be coadjutor of <a href="../cathen/02068a.htm">Auckland</a>, and was appointed the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wellington. An <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, Rev. J.P. O'Reilly, was the first resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Wellington, where he laboured from 1843 until his death in 1880.

<p>The Archdiocese of Wellington occupies territory in both the main islands, comprising the following provinces: Taranaki, Wellington, and Hawkes Bay in the north island, and the greater portion of Nelson in the south island. Its area is about 34,000 sq. miles, being somewhat larger in size than <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Wellington, the capital, owes its selection to the commanding position it occupies in Port Nicholson, the safest harbour in the dominion. Port Nicholson is an inlet of Cook Strait, the waterway dividing the north from the south island. The original capital was Auckland, but it had the disadvantage of not being centrally situated for the colony. The Governors of New South Wales, <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>, and Tasmania were asked each to appoint one commissioner for the purpose of determining the best site in Cook Strait. These gentlemen, having made a personal inspection of all suitable places, arrived at the unanimous decision that "Wellington in Port Nicholson was the site upon the shores of Cook Strait which presented the greatest advantages for the administration of the Government of the Colony". The seat of government was therefore, in accordance with the recommendation of the commissioners, removed to Wellington in 1865. Wellington was made an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> on 13 May, 1887. The population of the city is now 72,000. As the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> population of <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a> continued to increase rapidly, the Provinces of Otago and Southland, with the adjacent islands, were separated from Wellington in 1869, and erected into a new see, with Dunedin as the seat. Dr. Patrick Moran was transferred from South Africa to the newly-erected see, and became its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1887 a further division of the territory of the Diocese of Wellington was considered advisable. The Provinces of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, Westland, and the southern portion of Nelson were detached to form the new <a href="../cathen/03699a.htm">See of Christchurch</a>, and Dr. John J. Grimes, of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>, became its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>Mgr. Philip Joseph Viard, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wellington, was born at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1809. He made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a> in 1839, and left <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the same year for New Zealand. He spent some time in the islands of the Pacific, notably Wallis, Futuna, and New Caledonia. In 1846 he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and coadjutor to Mgr. Pompalier by <a href="../cathen/12201a.htm">Dr. Polding</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>. In 1850 he left Auckland to take up his residence in Wellington. In 1868 he paid a visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was present at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. He returned to Wellington in 1871, and died in 1872. Dr. Francis Redwood, the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Wellington, and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of New Zealand, was born in the <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Diocese of Birmingham</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in 1839. When he was only three years old the Redwood <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> came to New Zealand and settled in the Nelson district. At an early age he was sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to receive his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and after a distinguished collegiate course he resolved to enter the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. He accordingly made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1865. For some years after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he lectured on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Dundalk and Dublin, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. On the death of Mgr. Viard he was chosen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wellington, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 17 March, 1874, by <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a>. On 13 May, 1887, Dr. Redwood was created <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a>, and became <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of New Zealand. During his long life he has seen the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in New Zealand develop from a few scattered families-the mustard seed of the Gospel-to the rich and vigorous growth of the present day.
<h2>Statistics</h2>
