<h1>Archdiocese of Westminster</h1>  

<p>(WESTMONASTERIENSIS).

<p>Erected and made <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> in 1850, comprises the Counties of Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Essex, and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> north of the Thames. Its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> are <a href="../cathen/11107b.htm">Northampton</a>, <a href="../cathen/11133a.htm">Nottingham</a>, <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Southwark</a>. In 1911 the Province of Westminster, which included the whole of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, was divided into three; but certain privileges of pre-eminence over the new provinces were granted "for the safeguarding of unity, to the already historic Church of Westminster". The subject will be treated in the following order: <blockquote> I. The Making of the Diocese; <br>II. The Rule of the Archbishops; <br>III. Diocesan Institutions. </blockquote>
<h2 id="section1">The making of the diocese</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Westminster today represents two offices of the Pre-Reformation Church. As ordinary of the <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Diocese of Westminster</a> his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extends over much the same area as that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. As chief <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, he occupies a position similar to that of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of All <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. <a href="../cathen/02675a.htm">Edmund Bonner</a>, the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in 1569. <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, was dead before Elizabeth's Parliament had finally broken the continuity of episcopal succession in the English Church. Nearly three hundred years passed away before the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was restored. Nevertheless, as early as 1622, a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> was appointed for all <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; and the country was divided into four vicariates in 1688. The state of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the Archdiocese of Westminster today is a development on the foundations laid by the succession of eleven <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> in the London District (see <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">LONDON</a>).

<p>The beginning of the progress that has made the modern diocese must be dated from the passing of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Acts of 1778 and 1791, which brought freedom of teaching and worship. Throughout the ninety years previous the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> remained steady at about 20,000; while in the country parts of the London District, the numbers dropped from 50000 in 1746 to 4000 in 1773, the low-water mark of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Even towns in the London District, like Canterbury and Colchester, did not possess a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The venerable Bishop Challoner laboured on the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> mission for the last fifty years of this depressing period, and died in the midst of the ruin wrought in his district by the <a href="../cathen/06649c.htm">Gordon Riots</a> of 1780, occasioned by the first Relief Acts. He will ever be memorable as the devoted <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> who guided the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> through the long, dark hour before the dawn. Though his end came in troublous times, a better day was already breaking. For in the very year of the second Relief Act, Bishop Douglass was able to say in a report to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: "The Church is now beginning to flourish in our <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>"; and in the twenty years that followed, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the London District was considerably more than doubled.

<p>The development of the missions and the provision of more decent places of worship were the most obvious external results of the Relief Acts. The old <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were rebuilt on a larger scale, and the next thirty years saw the rise of many new ones in places hitherto impossible. The arrival of the French emigres in Bishop Douglass's time, while helping to spread the spirit of toleration, gave a further stimulus to the starting of missions and the building of <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> had always enjoyed a unique advantage over the rest of the country in respect of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship. This was due to the existence of the embassy <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and, in the reigns of Charles I and Charles II, to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> maintained by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> queens, Henrietta Maria and Catherine of Braganza. Even from Elizabeth's reign <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> seem to have been able to worship with immunity in the embassy <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The Spanish Embassy possessed, in the time of Elizabeth and James I, the old monastic church attached to the town-house of the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> (this pre-Reformation church, probably built about 1339, was once again restored to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship in 1879). In 1670, several Masses were said daily in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the Spanish, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> embassies; and Airoldi reported: "I was edified by the crowds of worshipers. Masses were said from eight o'clock to twelve, and during those hours the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were never empty". Several of these <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were open to the public in the latter part of the seventeenth and throughout the eighteenth centuries. Bishop Petre pointed out to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> their importance, and begged <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to persuade the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Powers to provide larger <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in convenient places. They suffered with the rest during the <a href="../cathen/06649c.htm">Gordon Riots</a>, but were repaired or rebuilt, and some of them have remained to our own day the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches of important <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> missions. The <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinian</a> Chapel, Lincoln's Inn Fields, which has registers <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1729, and which is said to have been founded in 1648, was doubled in size. At one time in the eighteenth century seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were attached to it, serving a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of nearly 14,000; in 1814 there was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 7000 served by four or five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In 1799 Bishop Douglass took over the lease of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and converted the ambassador's house into a presbytery, the mission being henceforward supported by the congregation. The old church, built by <a href="../cathen/08500b.htm">Inigo Jones</a> and enlarged by Sir Christopher Wren, was standing until 1909, when it had to be abandoned to make room for the London County Council improvements in connection with the new highway Kingsway, and the present church was built a short distance off. The Spanish Embassy always provided a public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The present mission of Spanish Place was set on a permanent footing in 1792, when Father Hussey, F.R.S. (afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Waterford and first President of Maynooth), built the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> which was used until the new <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, one of the most beautiful in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, was opened in 1890. The Warwick Street Chapel was first built in 1730 for the Portuguese Embassy. Its registers date from 1747, about which year it was attached to the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Embassy. It was rebuilt some eight years after the <a href="../cathen/06649c.htm">Gordon Riots</a>, and still stands today as the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London's</a> most aristocratic quarter. The French, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> Governments also maintained <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were public worship was carried out more or less attractively during the eighteenth century.



<p>Other mission that had been conducted in fear and trembling through the eighteenth century now found their opportunity. Soho is one such. It was "Little Ireland", the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> centre of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and also contained the town houses of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> gentry, who "formed each spring one united colony of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>", hence known as "The Holy Land". A large hall in Carlisle House was fitted up by <a href="../cathen/11240a.htm">Father O'Leary</a> in 1792, and continued in use for a hundred years until Canon Vere opened the present St. Patrick's Soho. One or more "Mass-houses" existed at Moorfields, close to the City of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, from the beginning of the eighteenth century. The old <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, along with the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, was utterly destroyed in the <a href="../cathen/06649c.htm">Gordon Riots</a>, and a new one, St. Paul's Moorfields, was fitted up in a dwelling house. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population increased so rapidly, from 4200 in 1791 to 12,700 in 1816, that a large church had to be built. It was opened in 1820, and became the principal church of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, three of them being buried there. In 1852 it was enlarged, and served as <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman's</a> pro-cathedral. <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> there in 1865. Ten missions have been formed from the original one. In 1899, the district around St. Mary Moorfields having long ceased to be a residential quarter, the church was sold and replaced by a smaller one. The old riverside <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Virginia Street in the East end was replaced by a new one in 1780. Its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population increased from 7000 in 1805 to 16,000 in 1850, and many new missions have since been established in its neighbourhood. The principal church of the district is now the beautiful <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Mary and St. Michael, in Commercial Road, opened in 1850.

<p>Great numbers of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and nobility came over to Bishop Douglass's district after the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. At one time there were as many as 5 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 27 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and 5000 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Eight <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were opened for their use, toward the building of which <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> alike subscribed. All but one were closed by 1814, on the return of the exiles to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. This one, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Louis in Little George Street, opened in 1799, was later given the title of "Chapel Royal of France", and continued to be served by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> until it was closed in 1911, shortly after the death of Mgr. Toursel. The exiled French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> also opened churches for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and thus laid the foundations of permanent <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> missions. Such are the missions of Tottenham, opened by the <a href="../cathen/01007c.htm">Abb&eacute;</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">de Chevereux</a> in 1794; Somers Town, opened by the famous Abb&eacute; Carron in 1808; Cadogan Terrace, Chelsea, opened by the Abb&eacute; Voyaux de Franous in 1812; and Hampstead, opened by the Abb&eacute; Morel in 1815.

<p>Catholic Emancipation, which placed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> civilly and politically on a level with their fellow-citizens, marks the next epoch. "It is especially since 1829", as <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> pointed out in 1863, "that the exterior expansion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> has been most visibly manifested." The next twenty years witnessed remarkable progress all round, which made the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> a necessity. The number of churches in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> was doubled; the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> trebled; while the number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> increased from one to nine. Ten years after Emancipation, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> numbered close on 150,000, about one-tenth of the total population of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>; and the churches were quite inadequate in size and number to the needs of the congregations. There were 400 conversions in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1836, and ten years later the harvest of the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford movement</a> was already being gathered. Because of the recent growth, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Muncris Apostolici Ratio" was published in 1840 to increase the vicariates from four to eight, as a first step towards a regular <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>.
<h2 id="section2">The rule of the archbishops</h2>
<h3 id="A">Cardinal Wiseman</h3>

<p>On 29 September, 1850, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Universalis Ecclesiae" was issued, restoring a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> with territorial titles. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> were formed into one <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. Westminster was raised to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, the twelve other sees being made suffragan to it. The old <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Vicariate gave place to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Westminster and Southward, the former retaining Middlesex, Hertfordshire, and Essex. <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Nicholas Wiseman</a>, the last <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the London District, was appointed first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and raised at the same time to the sacred purple. The new <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> letter "From out of the Flaminian Gate of Rome", announcing the reorganization of the English Church, aroused a storm of opposition in the country against what was termed "Papal aggression". On his return from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he made it his first business to allay the storm. How well he succeeded is attested by <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a>. "Highly as I put his <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a>, I was not prepared for such a display of vigour, power, judgment, sustained energy..." The Ecclesiastical Titles Act, indeed, passed into <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but it was a dead letter from the beginning.

<p>On <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> fell the task of beginning the reconstruction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The constitution given to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> was out of date, and a new code of legislation had to be laid down in the three <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">provincial Synods</a> held at Oscott in 1852, 1855, and 1859. The principal <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of those Synods defined the status of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters and the position of the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rectors</a> of missions, and regulated the government of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. In <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> much had to be done in the way of remodeling and reorganizing the missions. <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> gave a great impetus to the spread of popular devotions, introduced the Forty Hours' Adoration, and obtained more decorum and regularity in church services. Before his time daily Mass was regularly celebrated only in twelve churches in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Benediction and <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> were very rare, and seem to have been intermingled with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> at the will of the celebrant. In 1849 only one church in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> possessed a statute of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> also took the initiative in obtaining the appointment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> army <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> on an equality in all respects with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and in making some provision for the spiritual needs of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the navy. Both the military and naval <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains'</a> departments are now administered from Archbishop's House, Westminster (S.C. de Prop. Fide, 15 May, 1906).

<p>The question of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> was in very sad condition. <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> applied his energies to every new move. The Government started reformatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for juvenile offenders in 1854, and <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> at once secured that one should be reserved near <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> as the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reformatory. In 1857 he opened an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for homeless children; and at the time of his death he was busy with negotiations for providing the Poor Law children with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> instruction. Several new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were also opened for the poor children in the missions. One of the great means to which <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> looked for the carrying out of his schemes was the formation of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, especially of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, to help in the work of evangelizing the poor. When he first came to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> "there was not a single community of men". The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> indeed had a "splendid church" at Farm Street, opened in 1849; but could not provide a community of the nature that <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> required. In a few years, however, the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> had come. By the end of his life he had seen the establishment of fifteen communities of men, and the number of communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> increase from nine to thirty-two. These figures, taken in conjunction with the increase in number of churches from 46 to 120, and of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from 113 to 215, testify amply to the wonderful development of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> under the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>.

<p>But by 1852 <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> had already arrived at the conclusion that the regular communities could not give to the diocese the manifold activities he expected from them. He therefore determined to form a community of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> "ready to undertake any spiritual work which the Bishop cut out for them". The work was entrusted to <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Henry Edward (afterwards Cardinal) Manning</a>, and resulted in the formation of the Oblates of St. Charles in 1857. Unfortunately, this brought the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> some of the saddest days of his life. The new foundation aroused a strong opposition, at the head of which Archbishop Errington, coadjutor with <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of succession to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, was found. The controversy resulted in Archbishop Errington's resignation of his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of succession in 1862. He had been associated with <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> in all his undertakings, supplying the business capacity that <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> lacked; and in his retirement, it is recorded of him that "he nursed no resentment in his heart...His tongue left no sting or stain behind". <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> died in 1865, after several years of failing health. Always regarded on the Continent as one of the greatest personalities of the age, his popularity grew steadily in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> among all classes of the population. How thoroughly he had conquered was made known by an almost unique demonstration of public sympathy at the time of his death.
<h3 id="B">Cardinal Manning</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Mgr. Manning</a> had been appointed <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the Westminster Chapter under <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> in 1857, and now succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. The contrast between the roles of the first and second <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> has been drawn by the latter's biographer. "If <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman's</a> was the pilot's venturesome arm to steer the bark of Peter through heavy seas to a safe anchorage, it was <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning's</a> part to make smooth the way by tact and skill and intimate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the land, for the advance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> into the fullness of English life." <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning's</a> qualification in this respect were his Oxford training and his intimacy with English life and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The first thing to which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> turned his attention was the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the poor. "Our weak side is the education of our children", was <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman's</a> lament in 1863, and he estimated that there were 17,000 poor <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children unprovided for. <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>, in the first year of his episcopate, put the figures at 20,000, and saw that the difficulty could only be overcome by continual and organized effort. With this end in view, he established the Westminster Diocesan Educational Fund in 1866. The success of the new undertaking was all that he desired. Some fourteen years later he was able to say: "The work for the poor children may be said to be done...There is <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> room for all". A critical moment for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the passing of the Education Act of 1870, which established the School Boards. It was met by the crisis fund, started by the Committee under Lord Howard of Glossop, which eventually provided accommodation for 70,000 children at a cost of &#163;350,000.

<p>For the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>, even as early as 1864, considered that something in the nature of a Catholic University was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and feasible. For a moment he had entertained the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an academy for young <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But at the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of 1873, he returned to the plan of a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of higher studies in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, under the control of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province. In 1874 a Catholic University College was opened at Kensington, and, much against <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning's</a> wishes, a Senate was established to represent the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, colleges, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Men of distinction, including Prof. Barff, <a href="../cathen/10407b.htm">Dr. Mivart</a>, Father Clarke, Mr. Gordon Thompson, Mr. Paley, and Mr. Seagar, were appointed to act as professors under the rectorship of Mgr. Capel. The college <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a failure. After costing the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> &#163;10,000 it was eventually united to St. Charles's College (started by the Oblates in 1863 and transferred to a new site in 1874) as a higher department. <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a> then reconciled himself to "the postponement of any college for higher studies to the indefinite future". <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> had all through his life the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> much at heart. In 1866 he undertook the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/05472b.htm">English College, Rome</a>, and arranged for the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of one of the Oblates of St. Charles as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. In 1869 he transferred the students in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> from Ware to Hammersmith, where he began what he considered "a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> Seminary". New buildings were erected by 1884 at a total cost of &#163;37,000. <a href="../cathen/15572b.htm">Dr. Weathers</a> was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> until it was closed in 1892. He became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> auxiliary to <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> in 1872, and died in 1895 in his eighty-first year.

<p>Meanwhile the development of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, begun under <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a>, was maintained. New missions were founded; and ten churches built, two of them being among the principal churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, viz., the pro-cathedral at Kensington, the foundation stone of which was laid in 1867, and the Brompton Oratory, which was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1884. The development of the missions was facilitated by the growth in the numbers of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> during <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning's</a> episcopate from 215 to 358. In managing the business of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> relied greatly on his vicar- general, Mgr. Gilbert, founder of the Providence Row Night Refuge. Mgr. Gilbert was <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the Chapter at the time of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> death, and his name was put on the <em>terna</em> then submitted to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>In matters of social reform <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> was one of the leading men of all time. The foundation of the League of the Cross did more than any prohibitive legislation could for the promotion of temperance amongst the masses. he played an active part in the Royal Commission appointed in 1884 to enquire into the question of housing the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes. (It was on this occasion that the Prince of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, afterwards Edward VII, decided that "the name of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> should appear immediately after his own" in the list of commissioners.) Mansion House committees might always count on his active support in any charitable undertaking. He warmly espoused the cause of labour. The energy, insight, and skill which he displayed in imposing "the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal's</a> peace" on masters and men alike at the end of the Dock Strike of 1889 will not be easily forgotten. The Fourth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Westminster was held at <a href="../cathen/11239a.htm">St. Edmund's College</a> in 1873. <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Archbishop Manning</a> was made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1875, with the title of Sts. Andrew and Gregory on the Caelian Hill. Within the next four years, two other eminent <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were admitted to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>: Edward Howard and <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">John Henry Newman</a>.
<h3 id="C">Cardinal Vaughan</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> died 14 January, 1892, and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Herbert Vaughan</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a>, who became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> with the title of Sts. Andrew and Gregory on the Caelian Hill, in Jan., 1893. The foundation of St. Joseph's Society for Foreign Missions and his work in the <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Diocese of Salford</a> pointed him out as the man most eminently suited for the See of Westminster. He had the same <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> problems to face as <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a>, though under different conditions. The problem of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he thought could only be solved by "the concentration of labour and resources into one or two central <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>". He therefore closed the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Hammersmith, and, with the co-operation of seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of southern and midland <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, converted Oscott into a central <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. To give facilities for the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, he removed the prohibition against attendance at the national <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and formed the Universities Board. St. Edmund House was also opened at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a> for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students. All through <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan's</a> time the struggle for the better <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the poor continued, until the passing of the Education Bill of 1902, which placed existing denominational <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> on an equality in maintenance with the Board <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>As a result of an inquiry instituted in 1896, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> found that there were 1720 destitute <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children in non-Catholic homes. These agencies made no attempt to disguise their purpose: charity was given on the one condition that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the children was sacrificed. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> saw that he must take steps to provide a home for every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> child who was really destitute. He therefore founded the Crusade of Rescue. In 1901 the care of the rescue work was transferred to Father Bans, who had for some years been in charge of the homes for destitute children started by Rev. Lord Archibald Douglas in 1859. The work has prospered, until today (1912) the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> provides for 1000 children at a cost of &#163;16,000 a year.

<p>The chief and closing event of the episcopate of <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> was the erection of <a href="../cathen/15599a.htm">Westminster Cathedral</a>, of which the first stone was laid, 29 June, 1895. Owing to its special function and scope, this foundation may truly be said to have marked a new epoch in the life of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In it the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> realized a project which he had deeply at heart, namely that the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the chief <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> should be not only a large and stately building, but one in which should be revived the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> life and work, as in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> times, according to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ideal, and in which, as the "House of Prayer", the voice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the daily round of her <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">sacred liturgy</a> should ascend continually to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in thanksgiving and intercession on behalf of the people. All this he was wont to express by saying that it must be "a live <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>". For this purpose, he obtained permission from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> that the number of the canons of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter should be increased from twelve to eighteen, and as these are for the most part non-resident, he made provision for a body of eighteen <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> vicars or <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, whose main <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is the celebration of the daily High Mass and the choral recitation or chanting of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. In this they are assisted by a choir composed of choristers, and also of boys who are maintained and trained in the song-school attached to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> has thus been able to fulfill, under the fostering care of Cardinal Bourne, what its founder regarded as its missionary object &#151; that it should not only a fitting centre and summit to the structure of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but that it should stand in the midst of the capital of the British Empire as a worthy presentation of the dignity and beauty of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship in liturgy, music, and ceremonial. Its success and the multitudes which assemble within its walls have attested the public appreciation of the lofty ideal which entered into its erection, and have more than justified the wisdom of Cardinal Vaughan and his predecessors. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> also organized the researches which led to the decision given at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1896 on the subject of <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican Orders</a>.

<p>During his time the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was increased by 90, and the number of churches by 14 in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and 20 in the Home Counties. Mgr. Michael Barry succeeded Mgr. Gilbert as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the chapter in 1895. Bishop Robert Brindle, D.S.O., was <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> from 1899 till his appointment to the <a href="../cathen/11133a.htm">See of Nottingham</a> in 1901. He was succeeded as <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> by Bishop Patterson, who had been <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman's</a> intimate friend.

<p>To the college at Mill Hill, which he had founded as a young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and from which the Faith had since been spread to so many wild places of the earth, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> would retire from time to time to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for blessing on the work of his later years in the archdiocese; and there he breathed his last on 19 June, 1903.
<h3 id="D">Cardinal Bourne</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> died a month after <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a>, and one of the first acts of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> was the translation of Bishop Bourne, then in his forty-third year, to the See of Westminster. The new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">Londoner</a> by birth, had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Southwark</a> since, 1897, having been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05503a.htm">Epiphania</a>, as coadjutor with the right of succession, in the previous year. He was early marked as a leader of men by the ability and energy with which he conducted St. John's Seminary, Wonersh, from its very foundation, endowing it with his high <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ideals, and placing it amongst the leading colleges of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with a distinctive spirit of its own. It is almost the only <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> which is strictly <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a>, i.e. which <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educates</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> from boyhood in a purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college in the diocese. His training had fitted him to take the lead in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; for his student days were passed in the long-established English colleges at <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a> and Old Hall, in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of St. Thomas in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and St-Sulpice in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and finally, in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> side of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> University. His six years' government of the <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Diocese of Southwark</a> is especially memorable for the development of rescue and social works and for the opening of a very large number of new missions. It was already manifest that he possessed the great administrative ability, power of organization, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> which he has since displayed in a larger sphere of activity as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Westminster and head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> on 27 Nov., 1911, and received the same titular church, of St. Pudentiana, as <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>.

<p>The rule of the fourth <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> has been noted for the gathering together and organization of forces. <a href="../cathen/15599a.htm">Westminster Cathedral</a>, opened in 1903 and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1910, has become the focus of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> activities and the great centre of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. It witnessed the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of the Hierarchy in 1910; and secured the wonderful success of the Eucharistic Congress of 1908, at which seven <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, seventeen <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and over seventy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assisted. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> has been restored to its ancient home at Ware, and housed in a commodious modern building. The annual general meetings of the <a href="../cathen/15077a.htm">Catholic Truth Society</a> have developed into national congresses, in which all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> works of the country unite. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Women's League, founded in 1907, has banded <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> together for the furtherance of religious and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> interests, and of social work. The altar-servers of the country have been united in the Archconfraternity of St. Stephen, founded by Cardinal Bourne in 1905. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Federation has been established, with the object of enabling <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to take combined action in securing the due representation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests in public bodies; and thus concrete form has been given to the principles laid down by the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. At length, also, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> have, through the influence of Cardinal Bourne, been placed on an equality with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>.

<p>Cardinal Bourne has spoken with the voice of a great churchman who commands attention, on subjects of the first importance, e.g. the crisis of the French Church (1906), the Congo question (1909), temporal power (1911), present social unrest (1912), and the language question in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (1910 and 1912). "His is the straight word &#151; wise, conciliatory, never shrinking from a full statement, but only from an unfair one." Two events in particular have revealed him as a statesman capable of rising superior to any emergency. One was the tactful, but firm and decisive, handling of the Government's eleventh-hour prohibition of the Eucharistic Congress procession. The other was the conduct of the campaign against the Education Bill of 1906. The climax of this campaign was reached in the monster demonstration at the Albert Hall, where the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, supported by the Duke of Norfolk and Mr. John Redmond, rallied <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of every political creed to the defence of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>The publication of the <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> "Si qua est" on 28 October, 1911 marks a new epoch in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Hitherto the whole of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> had formed one <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, composed of one <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and fifteen suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. In 1911 three provinces were formed: Westminster in the east, Birmingham in the west, and Liverpool in the north. Westminster retains the Churches of <a href="../cathen/11107b.htm">Northampton</a>, <a href="../cathen/11133a.htm">Nottingham</a>, <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a>, and Southwark, as suffragan. "Moreover, for the preservation of unity in government and policy, to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Westminster are granted certain new distinctions of pre-eminence. He will be permanent chairman at the meetings of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of all <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> . . . he will take rank above the other two <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and will, throughout all <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, enjoy the privilege of wearing the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, of occupying the throne, and of having the cross carried before him. Lastly, in all dealings with the supreme <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, he will in his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> represent the entire episcopate of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>." The progress that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has made in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> since the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> may be realized from the fact, pointed out by Cardinal Bourne, that two of the new provinces "each possess more churches and larger bodies of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> than were contained in the whole country in 1850; while the third and smallest province falls very little short of the same degree of expansion". In the <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Diocese of Westminster</a> alone the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> has been multiplied by five, the number of churches by four, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population has been increased by one hundred and fifty thousand, during the same period of sixty years.

<p>Mgr. William A. Johnson, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01712a.htm">Arindela</a>, died in 1909. In the words of Cardinal Bourne, he had been "the main pivot in the government of the archdiocese for forty-four years". Born in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1832, he became assistant secretary to <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> in 1865, and chief <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> secretary two years later, in succession to Canon John Morris, the well-known writer, who then entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. He was made <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> under Cardinal Bourne in 1903, and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in 1904. On the petition of the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01712a.htm">Arindela</a> in 1906. After his death he was succeeded as <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the chapter by Mgr. Patrick Fenton, who had been president of St. Edmund's College from 1882 to 1887, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a> from 1900, and <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> from 1904.
<h2 id="section3">Diocesan institutions, etc.</h2>

<p><em>The Cathedral</em>, built in the Byzantine style, was begun in 1895, opened in 1903, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1910 (see <a href="../cathen/15599a.htm">WESTMINSTER CATHEDRAL</a>). The Westminster mission was started in 1792, with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of about 500. The Horseferry Road Chapel, opened in 1813, served this very poor district until 1903.

<p><em>Colleges and Boys' Schools.</em> &#151; Besides the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Ware, and the foreign missionary college at Mill Hill, there are: a training college for men teachers in elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and nine other institutions engaged in secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, all but two of which are conducted by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or religious. For girls, there are 37 <a href="../cathen/04342a.htm">convent schools</a>, three <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> under secular teachers, and one training college for teachers.

<p><em>Public Elementary Schools</em> number 116, of which 104 (including 199 departments) receive Government grants. In 1910-11 there were 36,902 children on the books of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In 1900 the numbers were 27,779; 21,315 in 1890; 11,145 in 1865. In 1849 the year before the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, there were only 8445 in all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p><em>Residential Institutions for Poor Children.</em> &#151; (1) Schools certified by Government: one reformatory, two industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, ten <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for <a href="../cathen/12254b.htm">Poor-Law</a> children, and five <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for ophthalmic, feeble-minded, crippled, or epileptic children. (2) Homes and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphanages</a> under the Rescue Society: four homes for boys and one for girls, with one home in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> for <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> children, under the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Emigration Association. (3) Other Homes: three for boys and ten for girls.

<p><em>Charities.</em> &#151; There are 35 homes and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> children, nine refuges for penitents, one night refuge, four <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">asylums</a> and three almshouses for aged <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and six <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. Much work is done amongst the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, the Ladies of Charity, and other organizations of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> watch over the interests of certain classes. Such are: the Converts' Aid Society (for convert <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>), the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Soldiers' and Seamen's Association, the Prisoners' Aid Society, the International <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Society for befriending girls.

<p><em>Periodicals.</em> &#151; "The Tablet", a weekly newspaper and review, is the chief <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Founded in 1840 by <a href="../cathen/09404b.htm">Mr. Frederick Lucas</a> as the organ of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, it <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to Dublin for a time in 1849. Mr. John Wallis brought it back to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and edited it until 1868, where it was bought by <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Father Herbert (afterwards Cardinal) Vaughan</a>. The "Dublin Review" was started in 1835, as "the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rival of the Whig "Edinburgh" and the Tory "Quarterly". <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> was to all intents and purposes the literary editor until 1863, when it passed into the hands of <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">W.G. Ward</a>. <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Bishop (afterwards Cardinal) Vaughan</a> became owner in 1879, and Bishop Hedlwy edited it until 1884, when <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Bishop Vaughan</a> took over the editorship himself. Mgr. Canon Moyes was editor from 1892 until the appointment of Mr. Wilfrid Ward by Cardinal Bourne in 1906. The "Catholic Directory", published annually in Westminster, supplies a guide to the varied activities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Great Britain. It is a development of the "Ordo recitandi", and the "Laity's Directory" (started in 1793), and appeared for the first time in its present form in 1838.
