<h1>Archdiocese of Yucat&aacute;n</h1>  

<p>(YUCATANENSIS).

<p>Located in the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Republic of Mexico</a>; Campeche and <a href="../cathen/14423b.htm">Tabasco</a> are its suffragans. Its area is that of the state of the same name, 17,204 sq. miles, and its population 337, 020 inhabitants (1910). There is a legend that long before the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> had been preached in Yucat&aacute;n by Quetzacoatl (see <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">MEXICO</a>). Yucat&aacute;n was the first region of the Mexican territory to receive the light of the Gospel in the sixteenth century; it was there that the first <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated. It is said that in 1517 Francisco Hern&aacute;ndez de Cord&oacute;ba, the discoverer and explorer of the region, founded the first <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> the newly-discovered land to be an island, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Sacri apostolatus ministerio", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 January, 1518, created the Bishopric of Yucat&aacute;n, under the name "Carolense" and placed it under the protection of "Santa Maria de los Remedios". When it was known that Yucat&aacute;n was part of the continent which <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s</a> was conquering, <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> made certain modifications (see <a href="../cathen/14747c.htm">TLAXCALA</a>), and Father Juli&aacute;n Garc&eacute;s, appointed first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Yucat&aacute;n, to make his residence at <a href="../cathen/14747c.htm">Tlaxcala</a> when he arrived in Mexico, as the Spanish had abandoned the conquest of Yucat&aacute;n for this new land. The first resident <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Francisco Toral, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, who took possession on 15 August, 1562, one year after his election; he assisted at the first and second Mexican councils.

<p>Marcos de Torres y Rueda, twelfth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1647), owing to dissensions between <a href="../cathen/11414a.htm">Juan Palafox</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14747c.htm">Tlaxcala</a>, and the Viceroy of New Spain, Count of Salvatierra, was named Viceroy of Mexico and entered into office, 13 May, 1648; he died at the capital, 22 April, 1649. Juan G&oacute;mez de Parada, twentieth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Yucat&aacute;n, <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a> with great success. His successor, Ignacio Castorena y Urs&uacute;a, was the founder of the first newspaper published in Mexico (see <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">CATHOLIC PERIODICAL LITERATURE - MEXICO</a>). Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Guerra, thirty-fifth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (d. 1863), lived during the famous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of caste which ruined almost the whole of Yucat&aacute;n; his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, energy and firmness prevented the city of Mariti from falling into the hands of the revolting Indians. It was at the instance of Leandro Rodr&iacute;guez de la Gala, his successor, that the new <a href="../cathen/14423b.htm">See of Tabasco</a> was formed from <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> taken form the Diocese of Yucat&aacute;n. The Province and Vicariate of Pet&eacute;n, situated in the Republic of <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, which ecclesiastically had belonged to Yucat&aacute;n, became a part of the See of <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>. Believing that the colony of Belice was his dependency, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sent missionaries there in 1864; this land, however, had been under the administration of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sent form the Vicariate Apostolic of Jamaica since 1837. The present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is Mgr. Tristschler y C&oacute;rdova, appointed on 11 November, 1906. The Diocese of Yucat&aacute;n was suffragan of Mexico until 1891, when it became suffragan of the newly-created Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/11180a.htm">Oaxaca</a>. In 1895 the new <a href="../cathen/03222b.htm">See of Campeche</a> was created from <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> taken from Yucat&aacute;n, to which was added all the territory of Quintana Roo. The Archdiocese of Yucat&aacute;n erected in 1906, has: a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and 30 students; 32 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and 9 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges, with 6738 students. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have erected 3 colleges, which have 79 students, and 2 churches.
