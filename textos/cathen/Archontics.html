<h1>Archontics</h1>  

<p>(From <em>archon</em>, prince, ruler).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> which existed in Palestine and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> about the middle of the fourth century. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> seems to be the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writer who speaks of this strange <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. He relates that a young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Palestine named Peter had been convicted of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, deposed from the office of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and expelled by Bishop A&euml;tius. He fled into that part of Arabia, where there was a centre of <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionitism</a>. In his old age, apparently but not really converted, he returned to Palestine, where he lived the life of an <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a> in a cave near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and attracted followers by the austerity of his life and the practice of extreme poverty. Shortly before the death of the <a href="../cathen/16027c.htm">Emperor Constantius</a> (337-361), Eutactus, coming from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, visited the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a> Peter and was imbued by him with the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> and carried them into Greater and Lesser <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Peter and the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> seems to have died out soon after.

<p>Following the description of <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> in giving a summary of the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, we find there are seven heavens, each of which is ruled by an <em>archon</em> (prince) surrounded by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> begotten by him, who are the jailers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In the eighth <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> dwells the supreme Mother of light. The king or tyrant of the seventh <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">Sabaoth</a>, the god of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who is the father of the Devil. The devil, dwelling upon earth, rebelled against his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and opposed him in all things, and by Eve begot Cain and Abel. Cain slew Abel in a quarrel about their sister, whom both <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which are of heavenly origin are the food of the princes who cannot live without them. When the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has reached the stage of Knowledge (<em>gnosis</em>), and has escaped the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the power of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">Sabaoth</a>, who is the author of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it flies to each of the heavens, makes <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to its prince, and finally reaches the supreme Mother and Father of all things, from whom it has dropped upon the earth. Theodoret adds that it is the practice of some of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to pour oil and water on the heads of the dead, thereby rendering them invisible to the princes and withdrawing them from their power. "Some of them", continues <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, "pretend to fast after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, deceiving the simple, and boast of having renounced all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. They deny the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>, admitting only that of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; they condemn <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and reject the participation of the Holy Mysteries as something introduced by the tyrant <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">Sabaoth</a>, and teach other fables full of impiety." They are addicted, says <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, "to a most shameful kind of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>." Their <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> books were the greater and lesser "Symphonia", the "Anabatikon [assumption] of Isaias", a book called <em>Allogeneis</em>, and other pseudo-prophetical writings. They rejected the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, but used sentences torn from their context both in the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> to prop up their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> refutes their extravagant doctrines at some length, showing the absurdity and dishonesty of their abuse of Scripture texts. He writes, not with the calm detachment of the historian, but with the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> who is dealing with contemporary <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.
