<h1>Archpriest</h1>  

<p>Just as among the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">bishop's church</a> one stood out as the special assistant and representative of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and, as <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, acquired a <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of his own, so do we find since the fourth century in numerous <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> an archpriest, or head of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, who aided and represented the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the discharge of his <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> and religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. As a rule, and especially in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whence the custom spread, the oldest of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> was invested with this rank; in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, on the other hand, his appointment often lay in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. By the seventeenth canon of the Fourth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Synod of Carthage</a>, the archpriest was also associated with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as his representative in the care of the poor. After the complete <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianization</a> of the Roman and Germanic peoples, we meet in the West with another kind of archpriest. The spiritual needs of the population scattered through the rural districts multiplied so rapidly that it became impossible for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the episcopal city to attend to all. Consequently, we soon find the larger rural centres equipped with their own churches, a permanent <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and their own sources of support. The inhabitants of the neighbouring hamlets, and of the widely scattered manors were, from the beginning, subject to these larger, or mother-churches (<em>ecclesia rusticana, dioecesana, parochia</em>), in so far as it was there that they heard Mass and received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The entire <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was known as <em>christianitas</em> or <em>plebs.</em>

<p>The archpriest was the first in rank among <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attached to such mother-churches. He was at the head of the local <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, had charge of Divine worship, and supervised the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ministry. He was, however, subject to the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>; several such large rural communities, or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, constituted an archidiaconate. The private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, which gradually multiplied on the estates of the great landowners and to which <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were attached, with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> permission, were not exempt from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the archpriest. All parishioners were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to be present at the principal Mass on Sunday in the mother-church (<em>ecclesia baptismalis, titulus major</em>). All <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> took place there and burial services were held nowhere else. In the lesser churches of the territory (<em>tituli minores</em>) there were permitted only the daily Mass, the usual devotions, and instruction in the elements of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The archpriest of the mother-church was the head of all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and was responsible for the proper execution of their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and for their manner of life. Gradually, it came about, especially in the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> period, that many <em>tituli minores</em> became independent <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, where all religious ceremonies, including Sunday Mass and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, were performed; the number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> was thus notably increased. It came about also that when a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was very extensive, the entire <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was subdivided into a number of districts (called archipresbyterates, decanates, or <em>christianitates</em>), over each of which a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was placed as dean or <em>archpriest.</em> The use of the term archipresbyterate for these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> districts proves that the former extensive <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> made a basis for this division, though the boundary lines of the new districts did not necessarily correspond with the limits of the original <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. In many cases entirely new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> districts were created, and sometimes several former archipresbyterates were united. Sometimes, also, attention was paid to the civil subdivisions of the territory in question. The entire <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of such a district constituted the rural chapter, at the head of which was the archpriest or rural dean. It was his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, as representative to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to supervise the entire religious and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life of the entire territory. He enforced the regulations of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and watched over their observance; presented to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> all candidates for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office; adjusted minor differences among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and made known to the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> any grosser misdeeds of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> in order that the suitable penance might be imposed upon the offender. It was customary in the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> period that on the first of every month the archpriest and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of his deanery should meet in common in order to discuss matters of importance. At a later date such meetings were called only once or twice a year. The rural chapter acquired in time the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> to the deanery; it also elected a <em>camerarius</em> for the administration of certain common funds, and a <em>diffinator</em>, or assistant to the dean. The union of such archipresbyterates formed an archidiaconate, whose deans were subject to the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>.

<p>In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, the office of dean or archpriest underwent many changes. This development was not the same in every country, and to this fact are traceable many local differences. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> was content with the establishment of regulations concerning the visitations of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> by the deans (Sess. XXIV, cap. 3, De reform.). <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> abolished the office of dean in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and established in its place that of rural vicar, or vicar forane (<em>vicarii foranei</em>), an office at all times revocable. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and in those neighbouring territories affected by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reorganization that followed the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, each of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> was divided into deaneries whose limits was calculated to correspond with the civil subdivisions. In each district the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the principal church was usually the dean. According to actual ecclesiastical law the division of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> into deaneries pertains to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; he may, if he chooses, combine several such districts and make of them a single larger one. The selection of the deans pertains entirely to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, though in some countries the rural chapters still retain the right of election. Deans possess no proper <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; they are merely delegates of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the performance of stated <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Their principal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is to facilitate relations between the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of their deanery and the ordinary (the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>), to exercise a certain supervision over the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, to visit the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and look into the administration of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. They are also wont to receive from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> permanent faculties for the performance of certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> benedictions. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of assisting the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Pontifical Mass, once incumbent on the archpriest of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, has devolved partly on the dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and partly on the auxiliary-bishop, should there be one.
