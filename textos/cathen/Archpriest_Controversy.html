<h1>Archpriest Controversy</h1>  

<p>This controversy arose in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on the appointment of George Blackwell as <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> on 7 March, 1598. The last member of the ancient <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06631b.htm">Goldwell</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph's</a>, had died in 1585, and thenceforth <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen</a> exercised informal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> with the acquiescence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and by common consent of the missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, then numbering about three hundred. After Allen's death in 1594 the want of a superior made itself felt. For some years there had been trouble at the English College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, resulting in difficulties between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, which were accentuated by the dissensions among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Wisbech. In 1597 <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Father Persons</a>, who had general charge of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> mission in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where the troubles at the English College had come to a head, and settled matters by becoming <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> there himself. Some of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, resenting the growing influence of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and distrusting the political views of <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Father Persons</a>, drew up a memorial against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to be presented to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Others wished for concord with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and believed that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> solution of difficulties so deeply prejudicial to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> lay in the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Persons himself at first favoured the appointment of one or more <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, preferably one to live and work in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and another to live in the Low Countries so as to organize and direct affairs while free from personal danger. But this plan was given up, the appointment of an <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> being decided on and effected by <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a>, <a href="../cathen/03341a.htm">Cardinal-Protector</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. This absolutely new form of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government was actively resented by a small but influential body of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, who claimed that they had the sympathy of a larger number of their brethren. Two of them, William Bishop and Robert Charnock, were sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to dispute the validity of the appointment and to explain their grievances, but on their arrival in December, 1598, they were arrested and confined as <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> in the English College. On 6 April, 1599, a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> was issued confirming the appointment of the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were released and dismissed from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but forbidden to return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> <a href="../cathen/09285a.htm">Thomas Lister</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, charged the appellant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, in a pamphlet which stirred up a controversy in which both sides employed unmeasured and violent language.

<p>Though the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> confirming the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> was at once accepted by the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, Blackwell insisted that the appellant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should make reparation for the guilt of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. They denied that they were guilty of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in appealing to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and referred the question to the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, which decided in their favour. Blackwell issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> condemning this judgment, and renewed another <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which he had published in the previous January, forbidding the publication of any defence of the appellants' conduct under pain of suspension. On 17 November a formal appeal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was signed by thirty-three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. This they supported by various pamphlets, which had been published early in 1601. The English Government now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of the trouble, and the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> entered into negotiations with Bluet, one of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, with the result that Bluet was brought before the Privy Council and induced them to "banish" four of the appellant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that they might prosecute their appeal. Bagshaw, <a href="../cathen/03568a.htm">Champney</a>, Bluet, and Barneby were chosen, but finally Mush and Cecil took the places of Bagshaw and Barneby. Bagshaw published a violent work called the "True Relation", and Watson, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, issued extravagant tirades against Blackwell and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. On 26 January, 1602, Blackwell published a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 17 August, 1601, which had been in his possession since Michaelmas. This again confirmed the appointment, but condemned the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest's</a> irritating conduct, suppressed all publications about the controversy, refused to admit any appeal, and urged mutual charity.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, however, the appellants succeeded with the help of the French ambassador in gaining a hearing, and on 5 October, 1602, a new <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> was issued (text in <a href="../cathen/14723b.htm">Tierney</a>, op. cit. infra, III, clxxxi) which <a href="../cathen/14723b.htm">Tierney</a> summarizes as "condemning the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, and justifying the appellants from the charges of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and rebellion, which had been urged against them. . . . It limited his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the foreign <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>; forbade him, in future and for the sake of peace, to communicate either with the superior of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, or with the general of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the concerns of his office; commanded him to supply the first three vacancies that should occur in the number of his assistants with <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> selected from amongst the appellant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and having ordered him to receive and transmit all appeals to the Cardinal Protector, concluded by condemning the past, and prohibiting all future publications in any manner connected with the present controversy". On the other hand the appellants failed to secure episcopal government, or the prohibition, which they sought, to restrain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, whether secular or regular, from provoking the Government by interference in political affairs. Nor did they obtain their request that all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> should be bound to manifest any designs against the queen or State of which they should learn. Elizabeth and her <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> were disappointed at the tenor of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> and retaliated by a proclamation (5 November, 1602) for the banishment of all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries. In reply to this thirteen of the appellants, including two future <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, drew up their famous address to the queen assuring her of their loyalty. (See <a href="../cathen/14723b.htm">Tierney</a>, op. cit. infra, III, 55-56, and clxxxviii sqq.) The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> of 5 October, 1602, finally settled the question, but an unfortunate legacy of mutual distrust and sore feeling remained behind and embittered the relations of the parties for many years to come. Government by <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> never worked well, and the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> became unanimous in their desire for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This was granted to them after the death of <a href="../cathen/07143c.htm">William Harrison</a>, the third <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, in 1621, when the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> selected William Bishop, one of the leading appellants, to be the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
