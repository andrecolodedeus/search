<h1>Arch&aelig;ology of the Cross and Crucifix</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Primitive cruciform signs</h2>

<p>The sign of the cross, represented in its simplest form by a crossing of two lines at right angles, greatly antedates, in both the East and the West, the introduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It goes back to a very remote period of human civilization. In fact, some have sought to attach to the widespread use of this sign, a real ethnographic importance. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in the sign of the cross the decorative and geometrical concept, obtained by a juxtaposition of lines pleasing to the sight, is remarkably prominent; nevertheless, the cross was originally not a mere means or object of ornament, and from the earliest times had certainly another &#151; i.e. symbolico-religious &#151; significance. The primitive form of the cross seems to have been that of the so-called "gamma" cross (<em>crux gammata</em>), better known to <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalists</a> and students of prehistoric arch&aelig;ology by its Sanskrit name, <em>swastika</em>.

<p>At successive periods this was modified, becoming curved at the extremities, or adding to them more complex lines or ornamental points, which latter also meet at the central intersection. The swastika is a sacred sign in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and is very ancient and widespread throughout the East. It has a solemn meaning among both Brahmins and <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a>, though the elder Burnouf ("Le lotus de la bonne loi, traduit du sanscrit", p. 625; Journ. <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> Soc. of Great Britain, VI, 454) believes it more common among the latter than among the former. It seems to have represented the apparatus used at one time by the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> in kindling fire; and for this reason it was the symbol of living flame, of sacred fire, whose mother is Maia, the personification of productive power (Burnouf, La <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> des <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>). It is also, according to Milani, a symbol of the sun (Bertrand, <em>La religion des Gaulois</em>, p. 159), and seems to denote its daily rotation. Others have seen in it the mystic representation of lightning or of the god of the tempest, and even the emblem of the Aryan pantheon and the primitive Aryan civilization. Emile Burnouf (op. cit., p. 625), taking the Sanskrit word literally, divided it into the particles <em>su-asti-ka</em>, equivalents of the Greek <em>eu-estike</em>. In this way, especially through the adverbial particle, it would mean "sign of benediction", or "of good omen" (<em>svasti</em>), also "of health" or "life". The particle <em>ka</em> seems to have been used in a causative sense (Burnouf, Dictionnaire sanscrit-fran&ccedil;ais, 1866). The swastika sign was very widespread throughout the Orient, the seat of the oldest civilizations. The <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> inscriptions carved in certain caves of Western <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> are usually preceded or closed by this sacred sign (Thomas Edward, "The Indian Swastika", 1880; Philip Greg, "On the Meaning and Origin of the Fylfot and Swastika"). The celebrated excavations of Schliemann at Hissarlik on the site of ancient Troy brought to light numerous examples of the swastika: on spindle-racks, on a cube, sometimes attached to an animal, and even cut upon the womb of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> idol, a detail also noticeable on a small <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the goddess Athis. The swastika sign is seen on Hittite monuments, e.g. on a cylinder ("The monuments of the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hittites</a>" in "Transactions of the Soc. of Bibl. Arch&aelig;ology", VII, 2, p. 259. For its presence on Galatian and Bithynian monuments, see Guillaume and Perrot, "Exploration arch&eacute;ologique de la Galatie et de la Bithynie", Atlas, Pl. IX). We find it also on the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of Lycia and of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> in Palestine. In the <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Island of Cyprus</a> it is found on earthenware vessels. It originally represents, as again at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> and Mycen&aelig;, a flying bird. In Greece we have specimens of it on urns and vases of Botia, on an Attic vase representing a Gorgon, on <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> (<a href="../cathen/13104b.htm">Raoul-Rochette</a>, "M&eacute;m. de l'acad. des inscr.", XVI, pt. II, 302 sqq.; "Hercule assyrien", 377-380; Minervini in "Bull. arch. Napolit.", Ser. 2, II, 178-179), and in the treasury of Orchomenus. It seems to have been unknown in <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, in Phnicia, and in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. In the West it is most frequently found in Etruria. It appears on a cinerary urn of Chiusi, and on the fibula found in the famous Etruscan <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> at Cere (Grifi, Mon. di Cere, Pl. VI, no. 1). There are many such emblems on the urns found at Capanna di Corneto, Bolsena, and Vetulonia; also in a Samnite <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> at <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, where it appears in the centre of the tunic of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> there depicted (Minervini, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. arch. Napolit., ser. 2, Pl. II, 178-179) This sign is also found in Pompeian <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, on Italo-Grecian vases, on <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (<a href="../cathen/13104b.htm">Raoul-Rochette</a>, "M&eacute;m. de l'acad. des inscr." Pl. XVI, pt. II, 302 sqq.; Minervini, "Bull. arch. Nap.", ser. 2, Pl. II, p. 178-179); finally among the ancient Germans, on a rock-carving in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, on a few Celtic stones in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and on a Celtic stone discovered in the County of Norfolk, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and now in the British Museum. The swastika, appears in an epitaph on a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> tombstone of <a href="../cathen/14634a.htm">Tebessa</a> in Roman Africa (Annuaire de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Constantine, 1858-59, 205, 87), on a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> of the <em>ignispicium</em> (Ennio Quirino Visconti, Opere varie, ed. <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, I, 141, sqq.), and in a Greek votive inscription at Porto. In the last monument the swastika is imperfect in form, and resembles a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Phnician letter. We shall explain below the value and symbolical meaning of this <em>crux gammata</em> when found on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments. But the swastika is not the only sign of this kind known to antiquity. Cruciform objects have been found in <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of Kings Asurnazirpal and Sansirauman, now in the British Museum, have cruciform jewels about the neck (Layard, Monuments of Nineveh, II, pl. IV). Cruciform earrings were found by Father Delattre in Punic <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> at Carthage.



<p>Another symbol which has been connected with the cross is the ansated cross (<em>ankh</em> or <em>crux ansata</em>) of the ancient Egyptians, wrongly called the "ansated key of the Nile". It often appears as a symbolic sign in the hands of the goddess Sekhet. From the earliest times also it appears among the hieroglyphic signs symbolic of life or of the living, and was transliterated into Greek as <em>Anse</em> (<em>Ansa</em>). But the meaning of this sign is very obscure (Da Morgan, Recherches sur les origines de l'Egypte, 1896-98); perhaps it was originally, like the swastika, an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> sign. The ansated cross is found on many and various monuments of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (Prisse d'Avennes, L'art Egyptien, 404). In later times the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (Copts), attracted by its form, and perhaps by its symbolism, adopted it as the emblem of the cross (Gayet, "Les monuments coptes du Mus&eacute;e de Boulaq" in "M&eacute;moires de le mission fran&ccedil;aise du Caire", VIII, fasc. III, 1889, p. 18, pl. XXXI-XXXII and LXX-LXXI), (For further information regarding the resemblance between the cross and the oldest symbolic signs see G. de Mortillet, "Le signe de la croix avant le christianisme", Paris, 1866; Letronne, "La croix ans&eacute;e &eacute;gyptienne" in "M&eacute;moires de l'acad&eacute;mie des inscriptions", XVI, pt. II, 1846, p. 236-84; L. M&uuml;ller, "Ueber Sterne, Kreuze und Kr&auml;nze als religi&ouml;se Symbole der alten Kulturv&ouml;lker", Copenhagen, 1865; W. W. Blake, "The Cross, Ancient and Modern" New York, 1888; Ansault, "M&eacute;moire sur le culte de la croix avant J&eacute;sus-Christ", Paris, 1891.) We may add that some have claimed to find the cross on Grecian monuments in the letter (<em>chi</em>), which, sometimes in conjunction with (<em>rho</em>), represented on <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> the initial letters of the Greek word <em>chrysoun</em>, "gold", or other words indicative of the value of the coin, or the name of the coiner (Madden, "History of Jewish Coinage", London, 1864, 83-87; <a href="../cathen/05274b.htm">Eckhel</a>, "Doctrina nummorum", VIII, 89; F. X. Kraus, "Real-Encyklop&auml;die der christlichen Alterth&uuml;mer", II, 224-225). We shall return, later on, to these letters.

<p>In the bronze age we meet in different parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> a more accurate representation of the cross, as conceived in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, and in this shape it was soon widely diffused. This more precise characterization coincides with a corresponding general change in customs and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. The cross is now met with, in various forms, on many objects: fibulas, <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cinctures</a>, earthenware fragments, and on the bottom of drinking vessels. De Mortillet is of opinion that such use of the sign was not merely ornamental, but rather a symbol of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, especially in the case of objects pertaining to burial. In the proto-Etruscan cemetery of Golasecca every <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> has a vase with a cross engraved on it. True crosses of more or less artistic design have been found in Tiryns, at Mycen&aelig;, in Crete, and on a fibula from Vulci. These pre-Christian figures of the cross have misled many writers to see in them types and symbols of the manner in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was to expiate our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Such inferences are unwarranted, being contrary to the just rules of criticism and to the exact interpretation of ancient monuments.
<h2 id="section2">The cross as an instrument of punishment in the ancient world</h2>

<p>The crucifixion of living <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> was not practised among the Hebrews; capital punishment among them consisted in being <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned to death</a>, e.g. the protomartyr Stephen (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#vrs57">Acts 7:57-58</a>). But when Palestine became Roman territory the cross was introduced as a form of punishment, more particularly for those who could not prove their Roman citizenship; later on it was reserved for thieves and malefactors (Josephus, Antiq., XX, vi, 2; Bell. Jud., II, xii, 6; XIV, 9; V, xi, 1). Though not infrequent in the East, it was but rarely that the Greeks made use of it. It is mentioned by Demosthenes (c. Mid.) and by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> (Rep., II, 5; also Gorgias). The stake and the gibbet were more common, the criminal being suspended on them or bound to them, but not nailed. Certain Greeks who had befriended the Carthaginians were crucified near Motya by order of Dionysius of Syracuse (Diodor. Sic., XIV, 53). Both in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and in the East the cross was a customary punishment of brigands (Hermann, Grunds&auml;tze und Anwendung des Strafrechts, G&ouml;ttingen, 1885, 83). It was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, however, that from early republican times the cross was most frequently used as an instrument of punishment, and amid circumstances of great severity and even cruelty. It was particularly the punishment for slaves found guilty of any serious crime. Hence in two places (Pro Cluent., 66; I Philipp., ii), Cicero calls it simply "servile supplicium" the punishment of slaves &#151; more explicitly (In Verr., 66), "servitutis extremum summumque supplicium" &#151; the final and most terrible punishment of slaves. H&uuml;schke, however (Die Multa), does not admit that it was originally a servile punishment. It was inflicted also, as Cicero tells us (XIII Phil., xii; Verr., V, xxvii), on <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> convicted of brigandage. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, that it was absolutely forbidden to inflict this degrading and <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> punishment on a Roman citizen (Cic., Verr. Act., I, 5; II, 3, 5; III, 2, 24, 26; IV, 10 sqq.; V, 28, 52, 61, 66); moreover, an illegal application of this punishment would have constituted a violation of the <em>leges sacrat&aelig;</em>. Concerning a slave, the master might act in one of two ways; he might condemn the slave arbitrarily (Horace, Sat. iii; Juvenal, Sat. vi, 219), or he might turn him over to the <em>triumvir capitalis</em>, a magistrate whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to look after capital punishment.

<p>The legal immunity of the Roman citizen was somewhat modified when the poorer citizens (<em>humiliores</em>) were declared subject to the punishment of the cross (Paul., "Sent.", V, xxii, 1; Sueton., "Galba", ix; Quintil., VIII, iv). The punishment of the cross was regularly inflicted for such grave crimes as highway <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> and piracy (Petron., lxxii; Flor., III, xix), for public accusation of his master by a slave (<em>delatio domini</em>), or for a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made against his masters prosperity (<em>de salute dominorum</em>, see Capitolin., Pertinax, ix; Herodian, V, ii; Paul., "Sent.", V, xxi, 4), for sedition and tumult (Paul., Fr. xxxviii; Digest. "De Pnis", XLVIII, 19, and "Sent.", V, 221; Dion., V, 52; <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, "Antiq.", XIII, xxii, and "Bell. Jud.", II, iii), for <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">false witness</a>, in which case the guilty party was sometimes condemned to wild beasts (<em>ad bestias,</em> Paul., "Sent.", V, xxiii, 1), and on fugitive slaves, who who sometimes burned alive (Fr. xxxviii, S. 1; Digest. "De Pnis", XLVIII, xix). According to Roman custom, the penalty of crucifixion was always preceded by scourging (<em>virgis c&aelig;dere</em>, <a href="../cathen/12517c.htm">Prudentius</a>, "Enchirid.", xli, 1); after this preliminary punishment, the condemned <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> had to carry the cross, or at least the transverse beam of it, to the place of execution (Plut., "Tard. dei vind.", ix, "Artemid.", II, xli), exposed to the jibes and insults of the people (Joseph., "Antiq.", XIX, iii; Plaut., "Most.", I, 1, 52; Dion., VII, 69). On arrival at the place of execution the cross was uplifted (Cic., Verr., V, lxvi). Soon the sufferer, entirely naked, was bound to it with cords (Plin., "Hist. Nat.", XXVIII, iv; Auson., "Id.", VI, 60; Lucan, VI, 543, 547), indicated in Latin by the expressions <em>agere, dare, ferre</em>, or <em>tollere in crucem</em>. He was then, as Plautus tells us, fastened with four nails to the wood of the cross ("Lact.", IV, 13; Senec., "Vita beat.", 19; Tert., "Adv. Jud.", x; Justus Lipsius "De Cruce", II, vii; xli-ii). Finally, a placard called the <em>titulus</em> bearing the name of the condemned man and his sentence, was placed at the top of the cross (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.1</a>; Suet., "Caligula", xxxviii and "Domit." x; <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs37">Matthew 27:37</a>; <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs19">John 19:19</a>). Slaves were crucified outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in a place called <em>Sessorium, </em>beyond the Esquiline Gate; their execution was entrusted to the <em>carnifex servorum</em> (Tacit., "Ann.", II, 32; XV, 60; XIV, 33; Plut., "Galba", ix; Plaut., "Pseudol.", 13, V, 98). Eventually this wretched locality became a forest of crosses (Loiseleur, Des peines), while the bodies of the victims were the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> of vultures and other rapacious birds (Horace, "Epod.", V, 99, and the scholia of Crusius; Plin., "Hist. Nat.", XXXVI, cvii). It often happened that the condemned man did not die of hunger or thirst, but lingered on the cross for several days (Isid., V, 27; Senec., Epist. ci). To shorten his punishment therefore, and lessen his terrible sufferings, his legs were were sometimes broken (<em>crurifragium, crura frangere;</em> Cic., XIII Philipp., xii). This custom, exceptional among the Romans, was common with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. In this way it was possible to take down the corpse on the very evening of the execution (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Adv. Jud.", x; <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore</a>, V, xxvii; Lactant., IV, xvi). Among the Romans, on the contrary, the corpse could not be taken down, unless such removal had been specially authorized in the sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. The corpse might also be buried if the sentence permitted (Valer. Max., vi, 2; Senec., "Controv.", VIII, iv; Cic., "Tusc.", I, 43; Catull., cvi, 1; Horace, "Epod.", I, 16-48; Prudent., "Peristephanon", I, 65; Petron., lxi sqq.).

<p>The punishment of the cross remained in force throughout the Roman Empire until the first half of the fourth century. In the early part of his reign Constantine continued to inflict the penalty of the cross (<em>affigere patibulo</em>) on slaves guilty of <em>delatio domini,</em> i.e. of denouncing their masters (Cod. Th. ad leg. Jul. magist.). Later on he abolished this <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> punishment, in memory and in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Jesus Christ</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250101.htm"><em>Church History</em> I.8</a>; Schol. Juvenal., XIV, 78; Niceph., VII, 46; Cassiod., "Hist. Trip.", I, 9; Codex Theod., IX, 5, 18). Thereafter, this punishment was very rarely inflicted (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.35</a>; Pacat., "Paneg.", xliv). Towards the fifth century the <em>furca</em>, or gibbet, was substituted for the cross (Pio Franchi de' Cavalieri, "Della forca sostituita alla croce" in "Nuovo bulletino di archeologia cristiana", 1907, nos. 1-3, 63 sqq.).

<p>The penalty of the cross goes back probably to the <em>arbor infelix</em>, or unhappy tree, spoken of by Cicero (Pro, Rabir., iii sqq.) and by Livy, apropos of the condemnation of Horatius after the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of his sister. According to H&uuml;schke (Die Multa, 190) the magistrates known as<em> duoviri perduellionis</em> pronounced this penalty (cf. Liv., I, 266), styled also <em>infelix lignem</em> (Senec., Ep. ci; Plin., XVI, xxvi; XXIV, ix; Macrob., II, xvi). This primitive form of crucifixion on trees was long in use, as Justus Lipsius notes ("De cruce", I, ii, 5; Tert., "Apol.", VIII, xvi; and "Martyrol. Paphnut." 25 Sept.). Such a tree was known as a cross (<em>crux</em>). On an ancient vase we see Prometheus bound to a beam which serves the purpose of a cross. A somewhat different form is seen on an ancient cist at Pr&aelig;neste (<a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a>), upon which Andromeda is represented nude, and bound by the feet to an instrument of punishment like a military yoke &#151; i.e. two parallel, perpendicular stakes, surmounted by a transverse bar. Certain it is, at any rate, that the cross originally consisted of a simple vertical pole, sharpened at its upper end. M&aelig;cenas (Seneca, Epist. xvii, 1, 10) calls it <em>acuta crux</em>; it could also be called <em>crux simplex</em>. To this upright pole a transverse bar was afterwards added to which the sufferer was fastened with nails or cords, and thus remained until he died, whence the expression <em>cruci figere</em> or <em>affigere</em> (Tac., "Ann.", XV, xliv; Potron., "Satyr.", iii) The cross, especially in the earlier times, was generally low. it was elevated only in exceptional cases, particularly whom it was desired to make the punishment more exemplary or when the crime was exceptionally serious. Suetonius (Galba, ix) tells us that Galba did this in the case of a certain criminal for whom he caused to be made a very high cross <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> white &#151; "multo pr&aelig;ter c&aelig;tteras altiorem et dealbatam statui crucem jussit".

<p>Lastly, we may note, in regard to the material form of the cross that somewhat different <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> prevailed in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The cross, mentioned even in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, is called in Hebrew, <em>'&ecirc;&ccedil;</em>, i.e. "wood", a word often translated <em>crux</em> by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (<a href="../bible/gen040.htm#vrs19">Genesis 40:19</a>; <a href="../bible/jos008.htm#vrs29">Joshua 8:29</a>; <a href="../bible/est005.htm#vrs14">Esther 5:14</a>; <a href="../bible/est008.htm#vrs7">8:7</a>; <a href="../bible/est009.htm#vrs25">9:25</a>). In Greek it is called, which Burnouf would derive from the Sanskrit <em>st&acirc;vora</em>. The word was however frequently used in a broad sense. Speaking of Prometheus nailed to Mount Caucasus, Lucian uses the substantive and the verbs and, the latter being derived from which also signifies a cross. In the same way the rock to which Andromeda was fastened is called <em>crux</em>, or cross. The Latin word <em>crux</em> was applied to the simple pole, and indicated directly the nature and purpose of this instrument, being derived from the verb <em>crucio</em>, "to torment", "to torture" (Isid., Or., V, xvii, 33; <a href="../cathen/06134a.htm">Forcellini</a>, s. vv. Crucio, Crux). It is also to be noted that the word <em>furca</em> must have been at least partially equivalent to <em>crux</em>. In fact the identification of those two words is constant in the legal diction of Justinian (Fr. xxviii, 15; Fr, xxxviii, S. 2; Digest. "De p&aelig;nis", xlviii, 19).
<h2 id="section3">The crucifixion of Jesus Christ</h2>

<p>Among the Romans the cross never had the symbolical meaning which it had in the ancient Orient; they regarded solely as a material instrument of punishment. There are in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> clear allusions to the Cross and Crucifixion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Thus the Greek lefter (tau or thau) appears in <a href="../bible/eze009.htm#vrs4">Ezekiel 9:4</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and other Fathers, as a solemn symbol of the Cross of Christ &#151; "Mark Thau upon the foreheads of the men that sigh". The only other symbol of crucifixion indicated in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is the brazen serpent in the Book of Numbers (<a href="../bible/num021.htm#vrs8">21:8-9</a>). <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself thus interpreted the passage: "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, so must the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be lifted up" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs14">John 3:14</a>). The Psalmist predicts the piercing of the hands and the feet (<a href="../bible/psa021.htm#vrs17">Psalm 21:17</a>). This was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> prophecy, inasmuch as it could not be conceived from any custom then existing; the practice of nailing the condemned to a T-shaped cross being, as we have seen, at that time exclusively Western. The cross on which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was nailed was of the kind known as <em>immissa</em>, which means that the vertical trunk extended a certain height above the transverse beam; it was thus higher than the crosses of the two thieves, his crime being judged a graver one, according to <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (Homil. v, c. i., on I Corinth.). The earliest <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Christian Fathers</a> who speak of the Cross describe it as thus constructed. We gather as much from St. Matthew (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs37">27:37</a>), where he tells us that the <em>titulus</em>, or inscription containing the cause of His death, was placed, "over", the head of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs38">Luke 23:38</a>; <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs19">John 19:19</a>). St. Iren&aelig;us (Adv. Haer., II, xxiv) says that the Cross had five extremities: two in its length, two in its breadth, and the fifth a projection (<em>habitus</em>) in the middle &#151; "Fines et summitates habet quinque, duas in longitudine, duas in latitudine, unam in medio". <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> agrees with him: "Erat latitudo in qua porrect&aelig; sunt manus longitudo a terr&acirc; surgens, in qu&acirc; erat corpus infixum; altitudo ab illo divexo ligno sursum quod imminet" (<a href="../fathers/1801103.htm"><em>Enarration on Psalm 103</em></a>; Serm. i, 44) and in other passages quoted by Z&ouml;ckler (Das Kreuz, 1875, pp. 430, 431).

<p>Nonnus confirms the statement that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was crucified on a quadrilateral cross (). St. Iren&aelig;us, in the passage cited above says that the Cross had a fifth extremity, on which the Crucified One was seated. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> calls it a horn, and compares it to the horn of a rhinoceros (Dialogus cum Tryphone, xci). <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> calls it <em>sedilus excessus</em>, a projecting seat, or shelf (Ad. Nat., I, xii). This little seat (<em>equuleus</em>) prevented the weight of the body from completely tearing the nail-pierced hands, and it helped to support the sufferer. It has never been indicated, however, in representations of the Crucifixion. On the Cross of Christ was placed the titulus, as to the wording of which the Four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> do not agree. St. Matthew (xxvii, 37) gives, "This is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>"; St. Mark (xv, 26) "The King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>"; St. Luke (xxiii, 38), "This is the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>"; St. John, an eyewitness (xix, 19), "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>". In representations of the Crucifixion there often appears beneath the feet a wooden support (, <em>suppedaneum</em>); that it ever existed is very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. The first express mention of it occurs in <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> (De Glori&acirc; Martyrum, vi). <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, Theodoret, and Rufinus hint at it.

<p>A microscopic examination of the fragments of the Cross scattered through the world in the form of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> reveals the fact that it was made from a pine-tree (<a href="../cathen/13117b.htm">Rohault de Fleury</a>, "M&eacute;moire sur les instruments de la Passion", Paris, 1870, 63). According to an ancient, but somewhat dubious, tradition the Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> measured in length very nearly 189 inches (4.80 metres), from 90&#189; to 102&#189; inches (2.30 to 2.60 metres). As noted by the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, two thieves were crucified, one on either side of Christ. Their crosses must have resembled the one on which He suffered; in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> and tradition they generally appear lower (<a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, Hom. i, xxvi, on I Cor.; on Rom., v, 5). A large portion of the cross of the good thief (traditionally known as Dismas) is preserved at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the altar of the Chapel of the Relics at Santa Croce in Gerusalemme.

<p>The historical narrative of the Passion and Crucifixion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as found in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a>, agrees exactly with all we have set down above concerning this form of punishment. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was condemned for the crime of sedition and tumult, as were also some of the Apostles (<a href="../cathen/08466c.htm">Malalas</a>, "Chronogr.", X, p. 256). His Crucifixion was preceded by the Scourging.

<p>He then bore His Cross to the place of punishment. Finally the legs of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> would have been broken, according to the custom of Palestine, in order to permit of burial that very evening, had not the soldiers, on approaching Him, seen that He was already dead (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs32">John 19:32, 33</a>). Besides, in ancient <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> and tradition, the Crucifixion of Christ appears as done with four nails, not with three, according to the usage of the more recent <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> (see below).
<h2 id="section4">Gradual development of the cross in Christian art</h2>

<p>Since by His holy sacrificial death upon the Cross Christ sanctified this former instrument of shame and ignominy, it must have very soon become in the eyes of the faithful a sacred symbol of the Passion, consequently a sign of protection and defence (<a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a>, "Carm. in Natal. S. Felicis", XI, 612; Prudent., "Adv. Symm.", I, 486). It is not, therefore, altogether strange or inconceivable that, from the beginning of the new religion, the cross should have appeared in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> homes as an object of religious veneration, although no such monument of the earliest <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> has been preserved. Early in the third century <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/02106.htm"><em>Stromata</em> VI</a>) speaks of the Cross as <em>tou Kyriakou semeiou typon</em>, i.e. <em>signum Christi</em>, "the symbol of the Lord" (<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="../fathers/1701117.htm">Tractate 117 on the Gospel of John</a>; <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Bull. d'arch. crist", 1863, 35, and "De titulis christianis Carthaginiensibus" in Pitra, "Spicilegium Solesmense", IV, 503). The cross, therefore, appears at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> as an element of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and to such an extent that in the first half of the third century <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> could publicly designate the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian body</a> as "crucis religiosi", i.e. devotees of the Cross (Apol., c. xvi, P.G., I, 365-66). <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> tells us (De Miraculis S. Martini, I, 80) that in his time <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> habitually had recourse to the sign of the cross. St. Augustine says that by the sign of the cross and the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Name of Jesus</a> all things are sanctified and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, as can be seen from the metaphorical language of the primitive faithful, the cross was the symbol of the principal <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virtue, i.e. <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> or victory over the passions, and suffering for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake and in union with Him (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs38">Matthew 10:38</a>; <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs24">16:24</a>; <a href="../bible/mar008.htm#vrs34">Mark 8:34</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs23">Luke 9:23</a>; <a href="../bible/luk014.htm#vrs27">14:27</a>; <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs19">Galatians 2:19</a>; <a href="../bible/gal006.htm#vrs12">6:12, 14</a>; <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs24">5:24</a>). In the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> the cross is synonymous with the Passion of Christ (<a href="../bible/eph002.htm#vrs16">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#vrs2">Hebrews 12:2</a>) even with the Gospel, and with religion itself (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs18">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>; <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs18">Philippians 3:18</a>). Very soon the sign of the cross was the sign of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. It is, moreover, very probable that reference to this sign is made in the Apocalypse (vii, 2): "And I saw another <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> ascending from the rising of the sun, having the sign of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>."

<p>It is from this original <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a> of the cross that arose the custom of making on one's forehead the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> says: "Frontem crucis signaculo terimus" (De Cor. mil. iii), i.e. "We <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> wear out our foreheads with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>." The practice was so general about the year 200, according to the same writer, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of his time were wont to sign themselves with the cross before undertaking any action. He says that it is not commanded in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, but is a matter of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition, like certain other practices that are confirmed by long usage and the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in which they are kept. A certain Scriptural authority for the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> has been sought by some in a few texts rather freely interpreted, especially in the above-mentioned words of Ezechiel (ix, 4), "Mark Thau upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and mourn for all the abominations that are committed in the midst thereof", also in several expressions of the Apocalypse (vii, 3; ix, 4; xiv, 1). It would seem that in very early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> was made with the thumb of the right hand (St. John Chrys., Hom. ad pop. Antioch. xi; <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, Ep. ad Eustochium; a practice still in use among the faithful during Mass, e.g. at the reading of the Gospel) and generally on the forehead; gradually, by reason of its symbolism, this sign was made on other parts of the body, with particularized intention (<a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, De Isaac et anim&acirc;, <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XIV, 501-34). Afterwards these different signs of the cross were united in one large sign such as we now make. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> the hand was carried from the left to the right shoulder; in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, on the contrary, it was brought from the right shoulder to the left, the sign being made with three fingers. This apparently slight difference was one of the (remote) causes of the fatal Eastern Schism.

<p>It is probable, though we have no historical evidence for it, that the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> used the cross to distinguish one another from the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> in ordinary social intercourse. The latter called the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> "cross-worshippers", and ironically added, "id colunt quod merentur", i.e. they worship that which they deserve. The <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">Christian apologists</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (Apol., xvi; Ad. Nationes, xii) and <a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a> (Octavius, lx, xii, xxviii), felicitously replied to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> taunt by showing that their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> themselves adored cruciform objects. Such observations throw light on a peculiar fact of primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, i.e. the almost total absence from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments of the period of persecutions of the plain, unadorned cross (<a href="../cathen/12799a.htm">E. Reusens</a>, "El&eacute;ments d'arch&eacute;ologie chr&eacute;tienne" 1st ed., 110). The truculent sarcasms of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> prevented the faithful from openly displaying this sign of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. When the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> did represent the sign of the cross on their monuments, nearly all sepulchral in character, they felt <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to disguise it in some artistic and symbolical way. One of the oldest of the symbols of the cross is the anchor.
<!--, sometimes carved thus and sometimes thus The latter is found most generally on the stone slabs of the oldest sections of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a>, especially in the <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">cemeteries</a> of Callistus, <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a>, Priscilla, and others.-->

Originally a symbol of hope in general, the anchor takes on in this way a much higher meaning: that of hope based on the Cross of Christ. The similarity of the anchor to the cross made the former an admirable <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> symbol. Another cruciform symbol of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, though not very common and of a somewhat later date, is the trident, some examples of which are seen on sepulchral slabs in the cemetery of Callistus. In one inscription from that cemetery the symbolism of the trident is even more subtle and evident, the instrument standing erect as the mainmast of a ship entering port, symbolical of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> saved by the Cross of Christ. We must note, too, the use of this peculiar symbol in the third century in the region of Tauric Chersonesus (the Crimea) on <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of Totorses, King of the Bosporus, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 270, 296, and 303 (De Hochne, "D&eacute;scription du mus&eacute;e Kotschonbey", II, 348, 360, 416; <a href="../cathen/03468d.htm">Cavedoni</a>, "Appendice alle ricerche critiche intorno alle med. Costantiniane", 18, 19 &#151; an extract from the "Opuscoli litterari e religiosi di <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>" in "Bull. arch. Napolit.", ser. 2, anno VII, 32). We shall speak again of this sign apropos of the dolphin. On a picture in the Crypts of Lucina, artistically unique and very ancient, there seems to be an allusion to the Cross. Turned towards the altar are two doves gazing at a small tree. The scene appears to represent an image of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> loosed from the bonds of the body and saved by the power of the Cross (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Roma Sotterranea Cristiana, I, PL XII).

<p>Before passing to the study of other, more or less disguised, forms of the cross, e.g. various monograms of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it may be well to say a word of various known forms of the cross on primitive monuments of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, some of which we shall meet with in our early study of the said monograms. &#151; The <em>crux decussata</em> or decussated cross, so called from its resemblance to the Roman <em>decussis</em> or symbol for the numeral 10, is in shape like the Greek letter <em>chi</em>; it is also known as St. Andrew's Cross, because that Apostle is said to have suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> on such cross, his hands and feet bound to its four arms (Sandini, Hist. Apostol., 130). The <em>crux commissa</em>, or gallows-shaped cross, is, according to some, the one on which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> died. In order to explain the traditional longitudinal extension of the Cross, which makes it resemble the <em>crux immissa</em>, it is asserted that this extension is only apparent, and is really only the <em>titulus crucis</em>, the inscription mentioned in the Gospels. This form of the cross (<em>crux commissa</em>) is probably represented by the Greek letter <em>tau</em> (), and is identical with the "sign" mentioned in the text of Ezechiel (ix, 4) already quoted. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> comments (Contra Marc., III, xxii) as follows on this text: "The Greek letter and our Latin letter T are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> form of the cross, which, according to the Prophet, will be imprinted on our foreheads in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>." Specimens of this veiled form of the cross are met with on the monuments of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a>, a very fine one, e.g., in an epitaph of the third century found in the cemetery of St. Callistus, which reads IRE T NE (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Bulletino d'archeologia cristiana", 1863, 35). In the same cemetery a sarcophagus exhibits clearly the gallows-cross formed by the intersection of the letters T and V in the monogram of a proper name carved in the centre of the <em>cartella</em>, or label. This second letter (V) was also figurative of the cross, as is evident from the inscriptions scratched on rock-surfaces at <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a> (Lenormant, "Sur l'origine chr&eacute;tienne des inscriptions sina&iuml;tiques", 26, 27; <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, loc. cit.). A monogram of a proper name (perhaps Marturius), discovered by Armellini on the Via Latina, shows the <em>crux commissa</em> above the intersection of the letters. Other monograms show similar forms. (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Bulletino d'archeologia cristiana", 1867, page 13, fig. 10, and page 14). It had been attempted to establish a connection between this form and the <em>crux ansata</em> of the Egyptians, mentioned above; but we see no reason for this (cf. Letronne, Mat&eacute;riaux pour l'histoire du christianisme en Egypte, en Nubie, et en Abyssinie). It would seem that St. Anthony bore a cross in the form of tau on his cloak, and that it was <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> in origin. Such a cross is still used by the Antonine <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Vienne in Dauphiny, and appear on their churches and on the monuments of art belonging to the order. <a href="../cathen/15754d.htm">St. Zeno of Verona</a>, who in the second half of the fourth century was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, relates that he caused a cross in form of a <em>tau</em> to be placed on the highest point of a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>. There was also another motive for choosing the letter T as symbolical of the cross. As, in Greek, this letter stands for 300 that number in Apostolic times was taken as a symbol of the instrument of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The symbolism was carried farther, and the number 318 became a symbol of Christ and His Cross: the letter (<em>iota</em>) being equal to 10, and (<em>eta</em>) to 8 in Greek (Allard, "Le symbolisme chr&eacute;tien d'apr&egrave;s Prudence" in "Revue de l'art chr&eacute;tien", 1885; Hefele, Ed. Ep. St. Barnab&aelig;, ix).

<p>The cross most commonly referred to and most usually depicted on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments of all ages is that called the <em>crux immissa</em>, or <em>crux capitata</em> (i.e. the vertical trunk extending beyond the transverse beam). It was on a cross such as this that Christ actually died, and not, as some would maintain, on a <em>crux commissa</em>. And this opinion is largely supported by the testimony of the writers we have quoted. The <em>crux immissa</em> is that which is usually known as the Latin cross, in which the transverse beam is usually set two-thirds of the way up the vertical. The equilateral, or Greek cross, adopted by the East and by <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, has the transverse set half-way up the vertical.

<p>Both the Latin and Greek crosses play an important part in the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> and decorative styles of church buildings during the fourth and subsequent centuries. The church of Santa Croce at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, is in the form of a Latin cross; and on the pillars of a church built by Bishop Paulinus at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> in the fourth century the cross is carved in the Latin way. The <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the <em>Catholicon</em> at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> shows a large Latin cross. And this style of cross was adopted by West and East until the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> occurred between the two churches. Indeed, at Constantinople the church of the Apostles, the first church of S. Sophia, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Constantine, those of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/14316c.htm">St. John at Studium</a>, of <a href="../cathen/04706b.htm">St. Demetrius</a> at <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Salonica</a>, of St. Catherine on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, as well as many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, are in the form of the Latin cross; and it appears in the decorations of capitals, balustrades, and <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>. In the far-off lands of the Picts, the Bretons, and the Saxons, it was carved on stones and rocks, with elaborate and complex Runic decorations. And even in the Catholicon at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, crosses no less lavishly ornamented are to be found. In out-of-the-way places in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, too, it has been discovered (cf. Dictionnaire de 1'Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts, V, 38).

<p>The Greek cross appears at intervals and rarely on monuments during the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> centuries. The Crypts of Lucina, in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of St. Callistus, yield an inscription which had been placed on a <a href="../cathen/02590a.htm">double grave</a> or sepulchre, with the names <em>ROUPHINA: EIRENE</em>. Beneath this is seen the equilateral cross &#151; disguised image of the gibbet on which the Redeemer died (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Rom. Scott., I, p. 333, Pl. XVIII). It is to be found also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> into the mantle of Moses in a fresco from the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/13486b.htm">St. Saturninus</a> on the Via Salaria Nuova, (Perret, Cat. de <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, III, Pl. VI). In later times it is to be seen in a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> of a church at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> built in the days of King Childebert (Lenoir, Statistique monumentale de Paris) and carved on the pedestals of the columns in the basilica of Constantine in the Agro Verano; also on the roofs and pillars of churches, to denote their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. More often, as we might expect, we find it on the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ades</a> of the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> and in their adornments, such as altars, <a href="../cathen/07626a.htm">iconastases</a>, sacred curtains for the enclosure, thrones, ambones and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> vestments. When the Emperor Justinian erected the church of Santa Sophia at Constantinople, with the aid of the architects Artemius of Tralles, and Isidore of <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a>, a new <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> type was created which became the model for all churches subsequently built within the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>, and the Greek cross inscribed in a square thus became their typical ground-plan. Perhaps, too the church of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a> may have been built upon this plan, as a famous epigram of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> would seem to indicate. There are other forms of cross, such as the <em>crux gammata</em>, the <em>crux florida</em>, or flowering cross, the <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a>, and the patriarchal cross. But these are noteworthy rather for their various uses in art and liturgy than for any peculiarity of style.

<p>The complete and characteristic form of <a href="../cathen/08717c.htm">Christ's monogram</a> is obtained by the superposition of the two initial Greek letters, <em>chi</em> and <em>rho</em>, of the name <em>CHRISTOS</em>. This is inexactly called the Constantinian monogram, although it was in use before the days of Constantine. It gained this name, however, because in his day it came much into fashion, and derived a triumphal signification from the fact that the emperor placed it on his new standard, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/08717c.htm">Labarum</a> (Marucchi, "Di una pregevole ed inedita inscrizione cristiana" in "Studi in Italia", anno VI, II, 1883). Older, but less complete, forms of this are made up of the <em>crux decussata</em> accompanied by a defective letter T, differing only slightly from the letter I, or encircled by a crown. These forms, which were used principally in the third century present a striking resemblance to a cross, but all of them are manifest allusions or symbols.

<p>Another symbol largely employed during the third and fourth centuries, the swastika already spoken of at some length, still more closely resembles the cross. On monuments dating within the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> it is known as the <em>crux gammata</em>, because it is made by joining four <em>gammas</em> at their bases. Many fantastic significations have been attached to the use of this sign on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments, and some have even gone so far as to conclude from it that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is nothing but a descendant of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> and myths of the people of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> generally; then these theorists go on to point out the close relationship that exists between <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, on the one hand, <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> and other Oriental <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, on the other. At the very least they insist upon seeing some relation between the symbolical concepts of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> and those of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Such was the opinion held by Emile Burnouf (cf. Revue des Deux Mondes, 15 August, 1868, p. 874). <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> ably refuted this opinion, and showed the real value of this symbol on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. d' arch. crist., 1868, 88-91). It is fairly common on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, being found on some sepulchral inscriptions, besides occurring twice, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, on the Good Shepherd's tunic in an <a href="../cathen/01699a.htm">arcosolium</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of St. Generosa in the Via Portuensis, and again on the tunic of the <em>fossor</em> Diogenes (the original epitaph is no longer extant. In the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">St. Domitilla</a> in the Via Ardeatina. Outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> it is less frequent. There is one example in an inscription found at Chiusi (see <a href="../cathen/03468d.htm">Cavedoni</a>, Ragguaglio di due antichi cimiteri di Chiusi). A stone in the museum at <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a> bears the monogram joined to the gamma cross, but it would seem to be of Roman origin. Another in the Mannheim Museum, with the name of a certain Hugdulfus, belongs to the fifth or sixth century. In a sarcophagus at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> belonging to the fourth century it is repeated over and over again, but evidently as a mere ornamental motive (see <a href="../cathen/01318a.htm">Allegranza</a>, Mon. di Milano, 74).

<p>De Rossi (Rom. Sott. Crist., II, 318) made researches into the <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> of this symbol, and the examples of it to be found in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and he observed that it was seldom or never used until it took the place of the anchor, i.e. about the first half of the third century, whence he inferred that, not being of ancient tradition, it came into fashion as the result of studied choice rather than as a primitive symbol linking the beginnings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> traditions. Its genesis is reflex and studied, not primitive and spontaneous. It is well known how anxiously the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> sought out means whereby they could at once portray and conceal the Cross of Christ. That in this way they should have discovered and adopted the <em>crux gammata</em>, is easily intelligible, and it is explained not merely by what has already been said, but also by the similarity between the Greek character <em>gamma</em> () and the Phnician character <em>tan</em>. The latter has been famous since Apostolic times as a symbol of the Cross of Christ and of the Redemption (cf. Barnab&aelig; Epist., ix, 9).

<p>The so-called Constantinian monogram prevailed during the whole of the fourth century, assuming various forms, and combining with the apocalyptic letters <a href="../cathen/01332b.htm"><em>Alpha</em> and <em>Omega</em></a>, but ever approaching more and more closely to the form of the cross pure and simple. In the latter part of that century what is known as the "monogrammatic cross" makes its appearance; it closely resembles the plain cross, and foreshadows its complete triumph in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>. The early years of the fifth century are of the highest importance in this development, because it was then that the undisguised cross first appears. As we have seen, such was the diffidence induced, and the habit of caution enforced, by three centuries of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, that the faithful had hesitated all that time to display the sign of Redemption openly and publicly. Constantine by the Edict of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> had given definitive peace to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; yet, for another century the faithful did not judge it opportune to abandon the use of the Constantinian monogram in one or other of its many forms But the fifth century marks the period when <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> broke away from old fears, and, secure in its triumph, displayed before the world, now become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> also, the sign of its <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>. To bring about so profound a change in the artistic traditions of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, besides the altered condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the eyes of the Roman State, two facts of great importance played a part: the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> apparition of the Cross to Constantine and the finding of the Holy Wood.

<p>Constantine having declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a> had invaded <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. During the campaign which ensued he is said to have seen in the heavens one day a luminous cross together with the words <em>EN-TOUTOI-NIKA</em>(In this conquer.) During the night that followed that day, he saw again, in sleep the same cross, and Christ, appearing with it, admonished him to place it on his standards. Thus the <a href="../cathen/08717c.htm">Labarum</a> took its origin, and under this glorious banner Constantine overcame his adversary near the Milvian Bridge, on 28 October, 312 (see <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">CONSTANTINE THE GREAT</a>).

<p>The second event was of even greater importance. In the year 326 the mother of Constantine, <a href="../cathen/07203a.htm">Helena</a>, then about 80 years old, having journeyed to Jerusalem, undertook to rid the Holy Sepulchre of the mound of earth heaped upon and around it, and to destroy the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> buildings that profaned its site, Some revelations which she had received gave her confidence that she would discover the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour's</a> Tomb and His Cross. The work was carried on diligently, with the co-operation of <a href="../cathen/09482a.htm">St. Macarius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had hidden the Cross in a ditch or well, and covered it over with stones, so that the faithful might not come and venerate it. Only a chosen few among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the exact spot where it had been hidden, and one of them, named Judas, touched by <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Divine inspiration</a>, pointed it out to the excavators, for which act he was highly praised by St. Helena. Judas afterwards became a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Christian saint</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> under the name of Cyriacus. During the excavation three crosses were found, but because the <em>titulus</em> was detached from the Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, there was no means of identifying it. Following an inspiration from on high, Macarius caused the three crosses to be carried, one after the other, to the bedside of a worthy <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was at the point of death. The touch of the other two was of no avail; but on touching that upon which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had died the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> got suddenly well again. From a letter of St. Paulinus to Severus inserted in the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> it would appear that St. Helena. herself had sought by means of a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> to discover which was the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> and that she caused a man already dead and buried to be carried to the spot, whereupon, by contact with the third cross, he came to life. From yet another tradition, related by <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, it would seem that the <em>titulus</em>, or inscription, had remained fastened to the Cross.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> discovery, St. Helena and Constantine erected a magnificent basilica over the Holy Sepulchre, and that is the reason why the church bore the name of St. Constantinus. The precise spot of the finding was covered by the atrium of the basilica, and there the Cross was set up in an oratory, as appears in the restoration executed by <a href="../cathen/15501b.htm">de Vog&uuml;&eacute;</a>. When this noble basilica had been destroyed by the infidels, <a href="../cathen/01699b.htm">Arculfus</a>, in the seventh century, enumerated four buildings upon the Holy Places around Golgotha, and one of them was the "Church of the Invention" or "of the Finding". This church was attributed by him and by topographers of later times to Constantine. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Mount Olivet, writing to <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a>, style it St. Constantinus. Perhaps the oratory built by Constantine suffered less at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> than the other buildings, and so could still retain the name and style of <em>Martyrium Constantinianum</em>. (See <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Bull. d' arch. crist., 1865, 88.)

<p>A portion of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> remained at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> enclosed in a silver <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a>; the remainder, with the nails, must have been sent to Constantine, and it must have been this second portion that he caused to be enclosed in the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of himself which was set on a porphyry column in the Forum at Constantinople; <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, the historian, relates that this <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> was to make the city impregnable. One of the nails was fastened to the emperor's helmet, and one to his horse's bridle, bringing to pass, according to many of the Fathers, what had been written by Zacharias the Prophet: "In that day that which is upon the bridle of the horse shall be holy to the Lord" (<a href="../bible/zec014.htm#vrs20">Zechariah 14:20</a>). Another of the nails was used later in the Iron Crown of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> preserved in the treasury of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Monza. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> in his Life of Constantine, describing the work of excavating and building on the site of the Holy Sepulchre, does not speak of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>. In the story of a journey to Jerusalem made in 333 (Itinerarium Burdigalense) the various <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> and the basilica of Constantine are referred to, but no mention is made of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>. The earliest reference to it is in the "Catecheses" of <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> (P.G., XXXIII, 468, 686, 776) written in the year 348, or at least twenty years after the supposed discovery.

<p>In this tradition of the "Invention", or discovery of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>, not a word is said as to the smaller portions of it scattered up and down the world. The story, as it has reached us, has been admitted, since the beginning of the fifth century, by all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, with, however, many more or less important variations. By many critics the tradition of the finding of the Cross through the work of St. Helena. in the vicinity of Calvary has been held to be mere legend without any historical reality these critics relying chiefly upon the silence of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, who tells of all else that St. Helena did in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but says nothing about her finding the Cross. Still, however difficult it may be to explain this silence, it would be unsound to annihilate with a negative argument a universal tradition <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fifth century. The wonders related in the Syriac book "Doctrina. Addai" (sixth century) and in the legend of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> Cyriacus, who is said to have been inspired to reveal to St. Helena, the place where the Cross was buried, are responsible at least in part for the common <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of the faithful on this matter. These <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> are universally held to be <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. (See Duchesne, Lib. Pont., I, p. cviii.) However that may be, the testimony of Cyril, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> from 350 or 351, who was on the spot a very few years after the event took place, and was a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a>, is explicit and formal as to the finding of the Cross at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> during the reign of Constantine this testimony is contained in a letter to the Emperor Constantius (P.G. XXXIII, 52, 1167; and cf. 686, 687). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the authenticity of this letter is questioned, but without solid grounds. St. Ambrose (De obit. Theod., 45-48 in P.L., XVI, 401) and Rufinus (Hist. eccl., I, viii in P.L., XXI, 476) bear witness to the fact of the finding. Silvia of Aquitaine (Peregrinatio ad loca sancta, ed. Gamurrini, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 1888. p. 76) assures us that in her time the feast of the Finding was commemorated on Calvary, that event having naturally become the occasion of a special feast under the name of "The Invention of the Holy Cross". The feast dates from very early times at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and it was gradually introduced into other Churches. Papebroch (Acta SS., 3 May) tells us that it did not become general until about the year 720. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> it is kept on the 3rd of May; the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> keeps it on the 14th of September the same day as the Exaltation, another feast of very remote origin, supposed to have been instituted at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to commemorate the dedication of the basilica of the Holy Sepulchre (335) and thence introduced at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Constantine's vision of the Cross, and perhaps another apparition which took place in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 346, would seem to have been commemorated in this same feast. But its chief glory is its connection with the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, after it had been carried away by the Persian king, Chosroes (Khusrau) II, the conqueror of Phocas, when he captured and sacked the Holy City. This Chosroes was afterwards vanquished by the Emperor Heraclius II and in 628 was assassinated by his own son Siroes (Shirva), who restored the Cross to Heraclius. It was then carried in triumph to Constantinople and thence, in the Spring of the year 629, to Jerusalem. Heraclius, who wished to carry the Holy Cross upon his own shoulders on this occasion, found it extremely heavy, but when, upon the advice of the Patriarch Zacharias, he laid aside his crown and imperial robe of state, the sacred burden became light, and he was able to carry it to the church. In the following year Heraclius was conquered by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mahommedans</a>, and in 647 <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was taken by them.

<p>In reference to this feast the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> associates with the memory of Heraclius that of St. Louis of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who, on 14 September, 1241 barefoot and divested of his royal robes, carried the fragment of the Holy Cross sent to him by the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, who had received it as a pledge from Baldwin. This fragment escaped destruction during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> and is still preserved at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. There, also, is preserved the incombustible cross left to the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s by the Princess Anna Gonzaga, together with two portions of the Nails. Very soon after the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> its wood was cut up into small <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and quickly scattered throughout the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian World</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this from the writings of St. Ambrose, of <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a>, of Sulpicius Severus, of Rufinus, and, among the Greeks, of <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, and Theodoret (cf. Duchesne, "Lib, Pont.", I, p. cvii; Marucchi "Basiliquesde Rome", 1902, 348 sq.; Pennacchi, "De Invent&acirc; Ierosolymis Constantino magno Imp. Cruce D. N. I. C.", Rome, 1892; <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, "Annales Eccl,", <em>ad an.</em> 336, <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, 1739, IV, 178). Many portions of it are preserved in Santa Croce in Gerusalemme at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in Notre-Dame at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/13117b.htm">Rohault de Fleury</a>, "M&eacute;moire", 45-163; Gosselin, Notice historique sur la Sainte Couronne et les autres Instruments de la Passion de Note-Dame de Paris", Paris, 1828; Sauvage, "Documents sur les reliques de la, Vrai Croix", Rouen, 1893). St. Paulinus in one of his letters refers to the redintegration of the Cross, i.e. that it never grew smaller in size, no matter how many pieces were detached from it. And the same St. Paulinus received from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Cross enclosed in a golden tube, but so small that it was almost an atom, "in segmento pene atomo hastul&aelig; brevis munimentum pr&aelig;sentis et pignus &aelig;tern&aelig; salutis" (Epist. xxxi ad Severum).

<p>The historical detail we have been considering sufficiently accounts for appearance of the cross on monuments <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the end of the fourth century and the beginning of the fifth century. In an <a href="../cathen/01699a.htm">arcosolium</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of St. Callistus a cross composed of flowers and foliage with two doves at its base is still partially disguised, but begins to be more easily recognizable (cf. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Rom. Sott., III, Pl. XII). Especially in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, where <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had made more rapid progress, the cross began to appear openly during the course of the fourth century; The most ancient text we have relating to a carved cross dates from later than A.D. 362. The cross was used on the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes and peoples with the superscription, <em>Salus Mundi</em>. The "adoration" of the Cross, which up to this time had been restricted to private cult, now began to assume a public and solemn character. At the end of the fourth century <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poets were already writing, "Flecte genu lignumque Crucis venerabile adora". The <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">second Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>, among other <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> that deal with images, lays down that the Cross should receive an adoration of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, "honorariam adorationem". (See <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">TRUE CROSS</a>.) To the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> who taunted them with being as much <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a> as they accused the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of being towards their gods, they replied that they took their stand on the nature of the cult they that it was not <em>latria</em>, but a relative worship, and the material symbol only served to raise their minds to the Divine Type, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Crucified (cf. Tert., "Apol", xvi; <a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a>, "Octav.", ix-xii). Wherefore St. Ambrose, speaking on the veneration of the Cross, thought it opportune to explain the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>: "Let us adore Christ, our King, who hung upon the wood, and not the wood" (<em>Regem Christum qui pependit in ligno . . . non lignum</em>. &#151; "In obit. Theodosii", xlvi). The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> observes the solemn public veneration (called the "Adoration") on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>. In the Gregorian Sacramentary we read: "Venit Pontifexet et adoratam deosculatur". In the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> the special veneration of the Cross is performed on the Third Sunday in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> (<em>Kyriake tes stauroproskyneseos</em> "Sunday of the Cross-veneration") and during the week that follows it. The gradual spread of the devotion to the Cross incidentally occasioned abuses in the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Indeed, we learn from the edicts of Valentinian and <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> that the cross was at times set up in very unseemly places. The evil-minded, the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and all those who practiced spells, charms, and other such <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> perverted the widespread <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> to their own corrupt uses. To deceive the faithful and turn their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> into lucre, these people associated the sign of the cross with their <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and magical symbols, winning thereby the confidence and trust of their dupes. To all this corruption of the religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> the teachers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> opposed themselves, exhorting the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and to beware of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> talismans (cf. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, Hom. vii in Epist. ad Coloss., vii, and elsewhere; <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Bull. d'archeol. crist." 1869, 62-64).

<p>The distribution of portions of the wood of the Cross led to the making of a remarkable number of crosses from the fourth century onwards, many of which have come down to us. Known under the names of<em> encolpia</em> and pectoral crosses they often served to enclose fragments of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>; they were merely crosses worn on the breast out of devotion&mdash;"To wear upon the breast a cross, hung from the neck, with the Sacred Wood, or with <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, which is what they call an<em> encolpium</em>" (Anastasius Bibliothecarius on Act. V of VIII Dec. Counc.). On the origin and use of pectoral crosses see Giovanni Scandella, "Considerazioni sopra un encolpio eneo rinvenuto in Corfu" (Trieste, 1854). <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, in his polemic against <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, wherein he panegyrizes the triumph of the Cross, testifies that whosoever, man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> possessed a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of it had it enclosed in gold and wore it around the neck (St. John <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom, ed.</a> Montfaucon, I, 571). St. Macrina (d. 379) sister of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>, wore an iron cross on her breast; we do not really <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its shape; perhaps it was the monogrammatic one taken by her brother from her dead body. Among the belongings of Maria, the daughter of Stilicho and wife of Honorius, laid away together with her body in the Vatican basilica, and found there in 1544, there were counted no fewer than ten small crosses in gold adorned with emeralds and gems, as may be seen in the illustrations preserved by Lucio Fauno (Antich. Rom., V, x). In the Kircherian Museum there is a small gold cross, hollowed for <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fifth century. It has a ring attached to it for securing it around the neck, and it seems to have had grapevine ornamentation at the extremities. A very beautiful cross, described by <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> and by him attributed to the sixth century, was found in a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in the Agro Verano at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. d'arch. Crist., 1863, 33-38). The general characteristic of these more ancient crosses is their simplicity and lack of inscription, in contrast to those of the Byzantine era and times later than the sixth century. Among the most noteworthy is the <em>staurotheca</em> of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (590-604), preserved at Monza, which is really a <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a> (cf. Bugatti, "Memorie di S. Celso", 174 sq.; Borgia, "De Cruce Velitern&acirc;", pp. cxxxiii sqq.). Scandella (op. cit.) points out that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> is the first to mention the cruciform shape given to these golden <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a>. But, as we have seen, they date from much earlier times, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the one found in the Agro Verano, among others. Some writers go too far in wishing to push their antiquity back to the beginning of the fourth century. They base their opinion on documents in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. In those of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Procopius we read that he caused a gold <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a> to be made, and that there appeared on it <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> in Hebrew letters the names Emmanuel, Michael, Gabriel. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, however, reject these acts, which they demonstrate to be of little authority (Acta SS., July, II, p. 554). In the history of St. Eustratius and other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Lesser <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, it is related that a soldier named Orestes was recognized to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> because, during some military man&oelig;uvres, a certain movement of his body displayed the fact that he wore a golden cross on his breast (cf. Aringhi, Rom. Subt., II, 545); but even this history is far from being entirely accurate.

<p>The recent opening of the famous treasury of the Sancta Sanctorum near the Lateran has restored to our possession some objects of the highest value in connection with the wood of the Holy Cross, and bearing on our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of crosses containing particles of the Holy Wood, and of churches built in the fifth and sixth centuries in its <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Among the objects found in this treasury was a votive cross of about the fifth century, inlaid with large gems, a cruciform wooden box with a sliding lid bearing the words (light, life), and lastly, a gold cross ornamented with cloisonn&eacute;s enamels. The first of these is most important because it belongs to the same period (if not to an even earlier one) as the famous cross of Justin II, of the sixth century, preserved in the treasury at St. Peter's, and which contains a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> set in jewels. It was held, up to the present, to be the oldest cross extant in a precious metal (De Waal in "R&ouml;mische Quartalschrift", VII, 1893, 245 sq.; Molinier, "Hist. g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des arts; L'orf&egrave;vrerie religieuse et civile", Paris, 1901, vol. IV, pt. I, p. 37). This cross, containing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Holy Cross, was discovered by <a href="../cathen/13728b.htm">Pope Sergius I</a> (687-701) in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> of St. Peter's basilica (cf. Duchesne, Lib. Pont., I, 347, s.v. Sergius) in a sealed silver case. It contained a jewelled cross enclosing a piece of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>, and dates, perhaps, from the fifth century.

<p>Enamelled crosses of this nature, an inheritance of Byzantine art, do not date earlier than the sixth century. The oldest example of this type we have is a fragment of the <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> adorned with cloisonn&eacute;s enamels in which a fragment of the cross was carried to Poitiers between 565 and 575 (cf. Molinier, op. cit.; <a href="../cathen/10525a.htm">Barbier de Montault</a>, "Le tr&eacute;sor de la Sainte Croix de Poitiers", 1883). Of later date are the Cross of Victory at <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a> near Aachen. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> cross, and that of St. Stephen at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Besides these we have in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the enamelled cross of <a href="../cathen/04403a.htm">Cosenza</a> (eleventh century) the <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a> cross, also in enamel, crosses in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> section of the Vatican Museum, and the celebrated cross of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a> (eighth or tenth century) adorned with precious gems and enamel, and discussed by <a href="../cathen/02685a.htm">Cardinal Stefano Borgia</a> in his work, "De Cruce Velitern&acirc;".

<p>The world-wide devotion to the Cross and its <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> during the fifth and succeeding centuries was so great that even the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclast</a> Emperors of the East in their suppression of the cult of images had to respect that of the Cross (cf. Banduri, "Numism. imp." II, p. 702 sq.; Niceph., "Hist. Eccl.", XVIII, liv). This cult of the Cross called forth the building of many Churches and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> wherein to treasure its precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. The church of S. Croce at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> was built by Galla Placidia before the year 450 "in honorem sanct&aelig; crucis Domini, a qu&acirc; habet et nomen et formam" (Muratori, Script. rer. ital., I, Pl. II, p. 544a). Pope Symmachus (498-514; cf. Duchesne, "Lib. Pont.", 261 s.v. Symmachus, no. 79) built an oratory of the Holy Cross behind the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> at St. Peter's, and placed in it a jewelled gold cross containing a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>. Pope Hilarius (461-468) did the like at the Lateran, building an oratory communicating with the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>, and placing in it a similar cross (Duchesne. op. cit., I, 242: "ubi lignum posuit dominicum, crucem auream cum gemmis qu&aelig; pens. lib. XX").

<p>The unvarying characteristic style of cross in the fifth and sixth centuries is for the most part decked with flowers, palms, and foliage, sometimes sprouting from the root of the cross itself, or adorned with gems and precious stones. Sometimes on two small chains hanging from the arms of the cross one sees the apocalyptic letters <em>Alpha</em>, <em>Omega</em>, and over them were hung small lamps or candles. On the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Felix at <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>, St. Paulinus caused to be written: "Cerne coronatam domini super atria Christi stare crucem" (Ep, xxxii, 12, ad Sever.). A flowered and jewelled cross is that <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> on the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Ponzianus on the Via Portuensis (cf. Bottari, Rorn. Sott., P1. XLIV). The cross is also displayed on the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> built by Galla Placidia, in the church of San Vitale, and in Sant' Apollinare in Classe, at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and over a <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> from St. Sophia at Constantinople. In 1867, at Berezov Islands, on the River Sosswa, in <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, there was found a silver plate, or <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a>, of Syrian workmanship, which now belongs to Count Gregory Stroganov. In the centre of it is a cross standing on a terrestrial globe studded with stars; on either side stands an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> with a staff in his left hand, the right being raised in adoration; four rivers flow from its base and indicate that the scene is in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>. Some learned Russians attribute the plate to the ninth century, but <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, more correctly, places it in the seventh century. In these same centuries the cross was of frequent use in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> rites and processions of great solemnity. It was carried in the churches where the stations were; the bearer of it was called <em>draconarius</em>, and the cross itself <em>stationalis</em>. These crosses were often very costly (cf. Bottari, Rom. Sott., Pl. XLIV), the most famous being the cross of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and that of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> was made at <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions over <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and things, sometimes with five fingers extended, to represent the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">Five Wounds of Christ</a>, sometimes with three, in sign of the Persons of the Trinity, and sometimes with only one, symbolical of the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and oblations <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> prescribed that two fingers be extended and thumb placed beneath them. This is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sign of the Trinitarian Cross. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> warmly recommended his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to make this <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign</a> with care, else their blessing would be fruitless. The action was accompanied by the solemn formula, "In nomine Patris, etc." Another use of the cross was in the solemn dedication of churches (see <a href="../cathen/01333a.htm">ALPHABET</a>; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">CONSECRATION</a>). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who performed the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> wrote the alphabet in Latin and Greek on the floor of the church along two straight lines crossing in the form of the Roman <em>decussis</em>. The letter X, which in the land-plottings of the Roman augurs represented, with its two component lines, the <em>cardo</em> <em>maximus</em> and the <em>decumanus maximus</em>, was the same <em>decussis</em> used by the Roman <em>agrimensores</em>, in their surveys of farms, to indicate boundaries. This sign was appropriate to Christ by its cruciform shape and by its identity in shape with the initial letter of His name, <em>Christos</em>, in Greek. For this reason it was one of the genuine forms of the <em>signum Christi</em>.

<p>The use of the cross became so widespread in the fifth and following centuries that anything like a complete enumeration of the monuments on which it appears is well nigh impossible. Suffice it to say that there is hardly a remnant of antiquity <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from this century, whether lowly and mean or noble and grand, which does not bear the sign. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this we shall give here a cursory enumeration. It is quite frequent on sepulchral monuments, on the imperial urns at Constantinople, on the plaster of the <em>loculi</em> (resting-places) in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, especially of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cemetery at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, on a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> at Boville near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on an inscription for a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> made in the form of a cross and now in the museum at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, on the interior walls of sepulchral chambers, on the front of marble sarcophagi <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fifth century. In these last instances it is common to see the cross surmounted by the monogram and surrounded by a laurel wreath (e.g. the sarcophagi at Arles, and in the Lateran Museum). A very fine specimen was found recently in excavations in <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">St. Domitilla's</a> <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> on the Ostian Way; it is a symbolical picture of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> freed from the trammels of the body, and saved by means of the Cross, which has two doves on its arms, while armed guards are asleep at its base. Lastly, in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, crosses have been found on sepulchral monuments. So universal was its use by the faithful that they put it even on household utensils, on <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medals of devotion</a>, on pottery lamps, spoons, cups, plates, glassware on clasps <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from Merovingian times, on inscriptions and votive offerings, on seals made in the form of a cross, on toys representing animals, on <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> combs, on the seals of wine-jars, on <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> boxes, and even on water-pipes. In objects of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use we meet it on Biblical <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>, on vestments, pallia, on leaden thongs inscribed with <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcising</a> formul&aelig;s and it was signed on the foreheads of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and candidates for confirmation. The <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> details of churches and <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> were ornamented with crosses; the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ades</a>, the marble slabs, the transoms, the pillars, the capitals, the keystones of arches, the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar-tables</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> thrones, the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, and the bells were also ornamented in the same way. In the artistic monuments the so-called cruciform nimbus around <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour's</a> head is well known. The cross appears over His head, and near that of the orante, as in the oil-stocks of Santo Menna. It is also to be met with on monuments of a symbolical nature: on the rocks whence flow the four celestial rivers the cross finds its place; on the vase and on the symbolical ship, on the head of the tempting serpent, and even on the lion in Daniel's den.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had become the official religion of the empire, it was natural that the cross should be carved on public monuments. In fact it was from the first used to purify and sanctify monuments and <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> originally <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>; it was prefixed to signatures and to inscriptions placed on public work; it was borne by consuls on their sceptres, the first to do so being Basil the Younger (A.D. 541 &#151; cf. Gori, Thes. <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptych</a>., II, Pl. XX). It was cut in marble quarries and in brickyards, and on the gates of cities (cf. <a href="../cathen/15501b.htm">de Vog&uuml;&eacute;</a>, Syrie Centrale; Architecture du VII si&eacute;cle).

<p>At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> there is still to be seen on the Gate of St. Sebastian the figure of a Greek cross surrounded by a circle with the invocations: In and around Bologna it was usual to set the sign of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the public streets. According to tradition, these crosses are very ancient, and four of them date from the time of <a href="../cathen/11782a.htm">St. Petronius</a>. Some of them were restored in the ninth and tenth centuries (cf. Giovanni Gozzadini, Delle croci monumentali che erano nelle vie di Bologna nel secolo xiii).

<p>The cross also played an important part in <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">heraldry</a> and diplomatic <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. The former does not directly come within our scope; of the second we shall give the briefest outlines. Crosses are to be found on documents of early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> and, being placed at the head of a deed, were equivalent to an invocation of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, whether they were plain or ornamental. They were at times placed before signatures, and they have even been equivalent to signatures in themselves. Indeed, from the tenth century we find, under contracts, roughly-made crosses that have all the appearance of being intended as signatures. Thus did <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a>, Robert Capet, Henry I, and Philip I sign their official documents. This usage declined in the thirteenth century and appeared again in the fifteenth. In our own day the cross is reserved as the attestation-mark of illiterate people. A cross was characteristic of the signature of Apostolic notaries, but this was carefully designed, not rapidly written. In the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> crosses were decorated with even greater magnif&igrave;cence. In the centre were to be seen medallions representing the Lamb of God, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Such is the case in the <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a> cross and that which Justin II gave to St. Peter's, mentioned above, and again in the silver cross of Agnello at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/03766b.htm">Ciampini</a>, Vet. mon., II, Pl. XIV). All this kind of decoration displays the substitution of some more or less complete symbol for the figure of Christ on the cross, of which we are about to speak.

<p>It may be well to give here a list of works bearing on the departments of the subject just treated, and containing illustrations which it has not been opportune to quote in the foregoing part of the article: STOCKBAUER, <em>Kunstgeschichte des Kreuzes</em> (Schaffhause, 1870); GRIMOUARD DE SAINT-LAURENT, <em>Iconographie de la Croix et du Crucifix</em> in <em>Ann. arch&eacute;ol</em>., XXVI, XXVII; MARTIGNY, <em>Dictionnaire des antiquit&eacute;s</em> <em>chr&eacute;tiennes</em>, s.v. <em>Crucifix</em>; BAYET,<em> Recherches pour savir &agrave; l'histoire de la peinture. . .en orient</em> (Paris, 1879): M&Uuml;NZ,<em> Les mosa&iuml;ques</em> <em>chr&eacute;tiennes</em> <em>de l'Italie</em> (l'oratoire de Jeann VII) in <em>Rev. arch&eacute;ol</em>., 1877, II; LABARTE, <em>Histoire des arts industriels</em>, II; KRAUS, <em>Real-Encyklop&auml;die der christliche</em>. Alterh&uuml;mer (Freiburg, 1882).
<h2>Later development of the crucifix</h2>

<p>We have seen the progressive steps &#151; artistic, symbolical, and allegorical &#151; through which the representation of the Cross passed from the first centuries down to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and we have seen some of the reasons which prevented <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> from making an earlier display of the figure of the cross. Now the cross, as it was seen during all this time was only a symbol of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Victim</a> and not a direct representation. We can thus more easily understand, then how much more circumspection was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in proceeding to a direct portrayal of the Lord's actual Crucifixion. Although in the fifth century the cross began to appear on public monuments, it was not for a century afterwards that the figure on the cross was shown; and not until the close of the fifth, or even the middle of the sixth century, did it appear without disguise. But from the sixth century onward we find many images &#151; not allegorical, but historical and realistic of the crucified Saviour. To proceed in order, we will first examine the rare allusions, as it were, to the Crucifixion in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> down to the sixth century, and then look at the productions of that art in the later period.

<p>Seeing that the cross was the symbol of an ignominious death, the repugnance of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to any representation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> torments and ignominy is easily understood. On a few sarcophagi of the fifth century (e.g. one in the Lateran, no. 171) scenes from the Passion are shown, but so treated as to show none of the shame and horror attaching to that instrument of death which was, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says, "to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> foolishness". Yet, from the first ages <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were loth to deprive themselves altogether of the image of their crucified Redeemer, though, for the reasons already stated and because of the <a href="../cathen/05032a.htm">"Discipline of the Secret"</a>, they could not represent the scene openly. The Council of Elvira, c. 300, decreed that what was to be adored ought not to be used in mural decoration. Wherefore recourse was had to allegory and to veiled forms, as in the case of the cross itself, (Cf. Br&eacute;hier, Les origines du Crucifix dans l'art religieux, Paris, 1904.) One of the most ancient allegories of the Crucifixion is considered to be that of the lamb lying at the foot of the anchor &#151; symbols respectively of the Cross and of Christ. A very ancient inscription in the Crypt of Lucina, in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a> of St. Callistus, shows this picture, which is otherwise somewhat rare (cf. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Rom. Sott. Christ., I, Pl. XX). The same symbol was still in use at the end of the fourth and beginning of the fifth century. In the description of the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> in the basilica of St. Felix at <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>, St. Paulinus shows us the same cross in connection with the mystical lamb, evidently an allusion to the Crucifixion, and he adds the well-known verse: "Sub cruce sanguine&acirc; niveus stat Christus in agno."

<p>We saw above that the trident was a veiled image of the cross. In the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of St. Callistus we have a more complicated study; the mystical dolphin is twined around the trident &#151; very expressive symbol of the Crucifixion. The early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in their artistic labours did not disdain to draw upon the symbols and allegories of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> mythology, as long as these were not contrary to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of St. Callistus a sarcophagus, dating from the third century, was found, the front of which shows Ulysses tied to the mast while he listens to the song of the Sirens; near him are his companions, who with ears filled with wax, cannot hear the alluring song. All this is symbolical of the Cross, and of the Crucified, who has closed against the seductions of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the ears of the faithful during their voyage over the treacherous sea of life in the ship which will bring them to the harbour of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Such is the interpretation given by <a href="../cathen/10081a.htm">St. Maximus of Turin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> read on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> (S. Maximi opera, Rome, 1874, 151. Cf. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Rom. Sott., I, 344-345 Pl. XXX, 5). A very important monument belonging to the beginning of the third century shows the Crucifixion openly. This would seem to contradict what we have said above, but it should be remembered that this is the work of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, and not of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, hands (cf. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, d'arch, crist., 1863, 72, and 1867, 75), and therefore it has no real value as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> among purely <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> works. On a beam in the <em>P&aelig;dagogioum</em> on the Palatine there was discovered a <em>graffito</em> on the plaster, showing a man with an ass's head, and clad in a perizoma (or short loin-cloth) and fastened to a <em>crux immissa</em> (regular Latin cross). Near by there is another man in an attitude of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with the legend <em>Alexamenos sebetai theon</em>, i.e., "Alexamenos adores <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." This <em>graffito</em> is now to be seen in the Kircherian Museum in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and is but an impious caricature in mockery of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Alexamenos, drawn by one of his <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> comrades of the <em>P&aelig;dagogioum</em>. (See the article entitled <em>Ass</em>.) In fact <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> tells us that in his day, i.e. precisely at the time when this caricature was made, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were accused of adoring an ass's head, "Somniatis caput asininum esse Deum nostrum" (Apol., xvi; Ad Nat., I, ii). And <a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a> confirms this (Octav., ix). The Palatine <em>graffito</em> is also important as showing that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> used the crucifix in their <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">private devotions</a> at least as early as the third century. It would not have been possible for Alexamenos' companion to trace the <em>graffito</em> of a crucified <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> clad in the <em>perizoma</em> (which was contrary to Roman usage) if he had not seen some such figure made use of by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Professor Haupt sought to identify it as a caricature of a worshipper of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> god Seth, the Typho of the Greeks, but his explanation was refuted by Kraus. Recently, a similar opinion has been put forth by W&uuml;nsch, who takes his stand on the letter Y which is placed near the crucified figure, and which has also been found on a tablet relating to the worship of Seth; he therefore concludes that Alexamenos of the <em>graffito</em> belonged to the Sethian <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. (With reference to the Alexamenos <em>graffito</em>, which certainly has a bearing on the crucifix and its use by the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, see <a href="../cathen/06389b.htm">Raffaele Garucci</a>, "Un crocifisso graffito da mano pagana nella casa dei Cesari sul Palatino", Rome, 1857; Ferdinand Becker, "Das Spott-Crucifix der r&ouml;mischen Kaiserpal&auml;ste", <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, 1866; Kraus, "Das Spott-Crucifix vom Palatin", Freiburg im Breisgau, 1872; Visconti, "Di un nuovo graffito palatino relativo al cristiano Alessameno", Rome, 1870; Visconti and Lanciani, "Guida del Palatino", 1873, p. 86; <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Rom. Sott. Crist.", 1877, pp. 353-354; W&uuml;nsch, ed., "Setianische Verfluchungstafeln aus Rom", Leipzig, 1898, p. 110 sqq.; Vigouroux, "Les livres saints et la critique rationaliste", I, 94-102.)

<p>The crucifix and representations of the Crucifixion became general after the sixth century, on <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, then on private monuments, and finally even on public monuments. But its appearance on monuments up to about the eighth century surely indicates such monuments to be works of private <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and devotion, or, at least, not clearly and decidedly public. As a matter of fact, it is noteworthy that, in the year 692, i.e. at the end of the seventh century the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Quinisext Council of Constantinople</a>, called the Trullan, ordered the symbolical and allegorical treatment to be laid aside. The earliest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> bearing a representation of Christ crucified is in a miniature of a Syriac codex of the Gospels <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from A.D. 586 (<em>Codex Syriacus</em>, 56), written by the scribe Rabula, and which is in the Laurentian Library at Florence. Therein the figure of Christ is robed (Assemani, Biblioth. Laurent. Medic. catalog., Pl. XXIII, p. 194). Other images of the crucifix belong to the sixth century. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, in his work "De Glori&acirc; Martyrum", I, xxv, speaks of a crucifix robed in a colobium, or tunic, which in his day was publicly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at Narbonne in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Genesius, and which he considered a profanation &#151; so far was the public cult of the crucifix from having become general up to that time. A cross belonging to the sixth century is to be found in the treasury at Monza, on which the image of the Saviour is wrought in enamel (cf. Mozzoni, "Tavole cronologiche-critiche della stor. eccl: secolo VII", 79), and which seems to be identical with that given by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> to Theodolinda, Queen of the Lombards. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that he gave a cross to Recared, King of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, and to others (cf. S. Gregorii Lib. III, Epist. xxxii; Lib. IX, Epist. cxxii; Lib. XIII, Epist. xlii; Lib. XIV, Epist. xii).

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, then, that the custom of displaying the Redeemer on the Cross began with the close of the sixth century, especially on <em>encolpia</em>, yet such examples of the crucifix are rare. As an example, we have a Byzantine <em>encolpion</em>, with a Greek inscription, which was <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> thought to have been discovered in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman Catacombs</a> in 1662, and about which the renowned <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Leo Allatius</a> has written learnedly (cf. "Codice Chigiano", VI; Fea, "Miscellanea filol. critica", 282). The little metal vases at Monza, in which was carried to Queen Theodolinda the oil from the Holy Places, show clearly how the repugnance to effigies of Christ lasted well into the sixth century. In the scene of the Crucifixion thereon depicted, the two thieves alone are seen with arms extended, in the attitude of crucifixion, but without a cross, while Christ appears as an orante, with a nimbus, ascending among the clouds, and in all the majesty of glory, above a cross under a decoration of flowers. (Cf. Mozzoni, op. cit., 77, 84.) In the same manner, on another monument, we see the cross between two archangels while the bust of Christ is shown above. Another very important monument of this century, and perhaps dating even from the preceding one, is the Crucifixion carved on the wooden doors at S. Sabina on the Aventine Hill, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Crucified Christ, stripped of His garments, and on a, cross, but not nailed to the cross, and between two thieves, is shown as an orante, and the scene of the Crucifixion is, to a, certain extent, artistically veiled. The carving is roughly done, but the work has become of great importance, owing to recent studies thereon, wherefore we shall briefly indicate the various writings dealing with it: Grisar, "Analecta Romana", 427 sqq.; Berthier, "La Porte de Sainte-Sabine &agrave; Rome; Etude arch&eacute;ologique" (Fribourg, Switzerland, 1892); P&eacute;rat&eacute;, "L'Arch&eacute;ologie chr&eacute;tienne" in "Biblioth&egrave;que de l'ensiegnement des beaux arts" (Paris, 1892, pp. 330-36); Bertram, "Die Th&uuml;ren von Sta. Sabina in Rom: das Vorbild der Bernwards Th&uuml;ren am Dom zu Hildesheim" (Fribourg, Switzerland, 1892); Ehrhard, "Die altchristliche Prachtth&uuml;re der Basilika Sta. Sabina in Rom" in "Der Katholik", LXXIX (1892), 444 sqq., 538 sqq.; "Civilt&agrave; Cattolica", IV (1892), 68-89; "'R&ouml;mische Quartalschrift", VII (1893), 102; "Analecta Bollandiana", XIII (1894), 53; Forret and M&uuml;ller, "Kreuz und Kreuzigung Christi in ihrer Kunstentwicklung" (Strasburg, 1894), 15, Pl. II and Pl, III; Strzygowski, "Das Berliner Moses-relief und die Th&uuml;ren von Sta. Sabina. in Rom" in "Jahrbuch der k&ouml;nigl. preussischen Kunstsammlungen", XVI (1893), 65-81; Ehrhard, "Prachtth&uuml;re von S. Sabina in Rom und die Domth&uuml;re von Spalato" in "Ephemeris Spalatensis" (1894), 9 sqq.: Grisar, "Kreuz und Kreuzigung auf der altchristl. Th&uuml;re von S. Sabina in Rom (Rome, 1894); Dobbert, "Zur Entstehungsgeschichte des Crucifixes" in "Jahrb. der preuss. Kunstsammlungen", I (1880), 41-50.

<p>To this same period belongs a crucifix at <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> (see Smith's "Dictionary of Christian Antiquities", London, 1875, I, 514), as well as an <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> in the British Museum. Christ is shown wearing only a loin-cloth: He appears as if alive; and not suffering physical pain. To the left, <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> is seen hanged; and below is the purse of money. In the following century the Crucifixion is still sometimes represented with the restrictions we have noticed, for instance, in the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> made in 642 by Pope Theodore in S. Stefano Rotondo, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There, between Sts. Primas and Felician, the cross is to be seen, with the bust of the Saviour just above it. In the same seventh century, also, the scene of the Crucifixion is shown in all its historic reality in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of <a href="../cathen/15254a.htm">St. Valentine's</a> <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> on the Via Flaminia (cf. Marucchi, La cripta sepolcrale di S. Valentino, Rome, 1878). Bosio saw it in the sixteenth century, and it was then in a better state of preservation than it is today (Bosio, Roma Sott., III, lxv). Christ crucified appears between <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and St. John and is clad in a long, flowing tunic (<em>colobium</em>), and fastened by four nails, as was the ancient tradition, and as <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> teaches: "Clavorum ergo dominicorum grati&acirc; quod quatuor fuerint h&aelig;c est ratio: duo sunt affixi in palmis, et duo in plantis" ("De Glori&acirc; Martyrum", I, vi, in P.L., XXI, 710).

<p>The last objections and obstacles to the realistic reproduction of the Crucifixion disappeared in the beginning of the eighth century. In the oratory built by <a href="../cathen/08423b.htm">Pope John VII</a> in the Vatican, A.D. 705, the crucifix was represented realistically in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>. But the figure was robed, as we may learn from the drawings made by Grimaldi in the time of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, when the oratory was pulled down to make room for the modern <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>. Part of such a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> still exists in the grottoes at the Vatican similar in treatment to that of <a href="../cathen/08423b.htm">John VII</a>. Belonging to the same century, though dating a little later, is the image of the Crucified discovered a few years ago in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the old church of S. Maria Antiqua in the Roman Forum. This remarkable picture, now happily recovered, was visible for a little while in the month of May, 1702, and is mentioned in the diary of Valesio. It dates from the time of <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Pope St. Paul I</a> (757-768), and stands in a niche above the altar. The figure is draped in a long tunic of a greyish-blue colour, is very lifelike, and has wide-open eyes. The soldier Longinus is in the act of wounding the side of Christ with the lance. On either hand are Mary and John; between them and the Cross stands a soldier with a sponge and a vessel filled with vinegar; above the Cross the sun and moon dim their rays.

<p>Another interesting picture is that in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of SS. Giovanni e Paolo at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in their dwellinghouse on the Celian Hill. It is Byzantine in style and shows the crucifix. In the ninth century the crucifix of <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> is of importance (840-847). It is a stripped figure with a perizoma and four nails are used. A similar figure is in the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of S. Stefano alla Cappella. To the same century belongs a <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptych</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rambona of about the year 898, and now in the Vatican Library (Buonarroti, "Osservazioni sopra alcune frammenti di vetro", <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1716, 257-283, and P. Germano da s. Stanislao, "La casa celimontana, dei SS. Giovanni e Paolo", Rome, 1895). To bring this list to a close we may mention an eleventh-century <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptych</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, a twelfth-century Roman cross preserved at the Porte de Halle, at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and an enameled crucifix in the Spitzer collection.

<p>Here we bring our researches to an end, the field of <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">Christian arch&aelig;ology</a> not extending further. In the artistic treatment of the crucifix there are two periods: the first, which dates from the sixth to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; and the second, dating from that time to our own day. We shall here treat only of the former, touching lightly on the latter. In the first period the Crucified is shown adhering to the cross, not hanging forward from it; He is alive and shows no sign of physical suffering; He is clad in a long, flowing, sleeveless tunic (<em>colobium</em>), which reaches the knees. The head is erect, and surrounded by a nimbus, and bears a royal crown. The figure is fastened to the wood with four nails (cf. <a href="../cathen/06389b.htm">Garrucci</a>, "Storia dell' arte crist.", III, fig. 139 and p. 61; Marucchi, op. cit., and "Il cimitero e la basilica di S. Valentino", Rome, 1890; Forrer and M&uuml;ller, op. cit., 20, Pl, III, fig. 6). In a word, it is not Christ suffering, but Christ triumphing and glorious on the Cross. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> for a long time objected to stripping Christ of his garments, and the traditional <em>colobium</em>, or tunic, remained until the ninth century. In the East the robed Christ was preserved to a much later date. Again in miniatures from the ninth century the figure is robed, and stands erect on the cross and on the <em>suppedaneum</em>.

<p>The scene of the Crucifixion, especially after the eighth century, includes the presence of the two thieves, the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> who pierced <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> side, the soldier with the sponge, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and St. John. Mary is never shown weeping and afflicted, as became the custom in later ages, but standing erect near the cross, as St. Ambrose says, in his funeral oration on Valentinian: "I read of her standing; I do not read of her weeping." Moreover, on either side of the Cross the sun and the moon, often with human faces, veil their brightness, being placed there to typify the two natures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the sun, the Divine, and the moon, the human (cf. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, Homily ii in Evang.). At the foot of the Cross the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> figures are symbolical of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">Synagogue</a>, the one receiving the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour's</a> blood in a cup, the other veiled and discrowned, holding in her hand a torn banner. With the tenth century realism began to play a part in <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, and the colobium becomes a shorter garment, reaching from the waist to the knees (<em>perizoma</em>). In the "Hortus deliciarum" in the "album" belonging to the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Herrada of Landsberg in the twelfth the colobium is short, and approaches the form of the perizoma. From the eleventh century in the East, and from the Gothic period in the West, the head droops onto the breast (cf. Borgia, De Cruce Velitern&acirc;, 191), the crown of thorns is introduced, the arms are bent back, the body is twisted, the face is wrung with agony, and blood flows from the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">wounds</a>. In the thirteenth century complete realism is reached by the substitution of one nail in the feet, instead of two, as in the old tradition, and the resulting crossing of the legs. All this was done from artistic motives, to bring about a more moving and devotional pose. The living and triumphant Christ gives place to a Christ dead, in all the humiliation of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, the agony of His death being even accentuated. This manner of treatment was afterwards generalized by the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>. In conclusion it may be noted that the custom of placing the crucifix over the altar does not date from earlier than the eleventh century. (See <a href="../cathen/04533a.htm">CROSS AND CRUCIFIX IN LITURGY</a>.)
