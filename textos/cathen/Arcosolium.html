<h1>Arcosolium</h1>  

<p>This word is derived from <em>arcus</em> "arch" and <em>solium</em>, a term sometimes used by Latin writers in the sense of "sarcophagus"; <em>solium porphyretici marmoris</em> (Suet., Ner., 50). The term <em>arcosolium</em> was applied by the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to one form of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> that exist in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a>. Thus, an inscription published by Marchi (Mon. delle arti prim., 85), which may still be seen in the courtyard of the Palazzo Borghese, states that "Aur. Celsus and Aur. Hilaritas have had made for themselves and their friends this arcosolium, with its little wall, in peace." The arcosolium <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> were formed by first excavating in the tufa walls a space similar to an ordinary loculus surmounted by an arch. After this space was cleared an oblong cavity was opened from above downwards into that part of the rock facing the arch; a marble slab placed horizontally over the opening thus made completed the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, which in this way became a species of sarcophagus hewn out of the living rock. The horizontal slab closing the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was about the height of an ordinary table from the ground. In some instances, as in the "papal <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>" and the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of <a href="../cathen/08295a.htm">St. Januarius</a>, the front wall of the arcosolium <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was constructed of masonry. A species of <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> similar in all respects but one to the arcosolium is the so-called <em>sepulchrum a mens&acirc;</em>, or table-tomb; in this a rectangular niche takes the place of the arch. The baldacchino <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and Malta belong also to this class; they consist of a combination of several arcosolia. A more ancient form of the arcosolium than that described consisted of an arched niche, excavated to the level of the floor, in which sarcophagi of marble or terra-cotta containing the remains of the deceased were placed. Arcosolium <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> were much in vogue during the third century in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Many of the later <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in them, and there are reasons to suppose that in such instances the horizontal slabs closing the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> a served as altars on certain occasions. The arcosolia of the Roman cemeteries were usually decorated with symbolic frescoes, the vault of the arch and the lunette being prepared with stucco for this purpose. One of the most interesting examples of an arcosolium adorned in this manner may be seen in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Sts. Peter and Marcellinus; in the lunette the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of Cana is represented as a symbol of the Eucharist, while on the arch a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> scene and a symbol of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> - always associated with Eucharistic symbols - are depicted on either side of a veiled <em>orans</em>. A second excellent example of a decorated arcosolium, in the <em>C&aelig;meterium Majus</em>, represents on the arch our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> between two <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> figures, and in the lunette Mary as an <em>orans</em> (unique in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>), with the child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">CATACOMBS</a>.)
