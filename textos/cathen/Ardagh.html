<h1>Ardagh</h1>  

<p>(High Field).

<p>Ardagh, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> diocese in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Armagh, takes its name from a town in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and barony of same name in county Longford, province of Leinster. Here, according to <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a>, <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Maine, Lord of South Teffia, in Longford, built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> in a place called Ardachadh, which to this day is a see, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Mel, the son of his sister Darerca, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> leaving with him Melchu (Mel's brother) as co-bishop. Archbishop Healy accepts this statement, though <a href="../cathen/16051a.htm">Lanigan</a> and <a href="../cathen/11224d.htm">O'Hanlon</a> reject the co-episcopate of the brothers. The church of Ardagh was founded in 454 and is justly held to have been one of the most ancient in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. St. Mel, or Moel, was not only the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this church, but also <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the adjoining <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and is yet patron of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Outside the town are the ruins of a small primitive church the remains of which are of cyclopean character. The see originally comprised the country of the Eastern Conmaice. It consisted of the territory of the O'Ferals and the O'Quinns in the county Longford, called Annally, and the territory of Muintir Eolais, i.e. of MacRannal (O'Reynolds) in Leitrim. From the death of St. Mel to the coming of the English under Henry II (1169) the extant records of episcopal succession (for which see <a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a>, Series episcoporum <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, 1873-1876) are uncertain, meagre, and broken. St. Erard, who ruled over this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 754, having journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with some companions, died at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, of which see he is said to have been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries several members of the O'Feral clan occupied the chair of St. Mel. The <a href="../cathen/04065a.htm">Diocese of Clonmacnoise</a> was united to that of Ardagh in 1729, during the episcopate of Bishop Flynn, and so continues. The modern Diocese of Ardagh includes nearly all of Longford, the greater part of Leitrim, and portions of King's County, Westmeath, Roscommon, and Sligo. There is a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise, and there are forty-one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is at Longford, where a fine <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> have been erected.
