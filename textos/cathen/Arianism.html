<h1>Arianism</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which arose in the fourth century, and denied the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.
<h2>Doctrine</h2>

<p>First among the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> disputes which troubled <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> after Constantine had recognized the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in A.D. 313, and the parent of many more during some three centuries, Arianism occupies a large place in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. It is not a modern form of unbelief, and therefore will appear strange in modern eyes. But we shall better grasp its meaning if we term it an Eastern attempt to rationalize the creed by stripping it of mystery so far as the relation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was concerned. In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and in Church teaching <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a> appears as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. This name He took to Himself (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs27">Matthew 11:27</a>; <a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs36">John 10:36</a>), while the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> declares Him to be the Word (Logos), Who in the beginning was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by Whom all things were made. A similar <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is laid down by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, in his undoubtedly genuine Epistles to the Ephesians, Colossians, and Philippians. It is reiterated in the Letters of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, and accounts for Pliny's observation that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in their assemblies chanted a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the question how the Son was related to the Father (Himself acknowledged on all hands to be the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Supreme Deity</a>), gave rise, between the years A.D. 60 and 200, to a number of <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">Theosophic</a> systems, called generally <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, and having for their authors <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, Valentinus, <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, and other Greek speculators. Though all of these visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, they had no following in the West, which remained free from controversies of an abstract nature, and was faithful to the creed of its <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Intellectual centres were chiefly Alexandria and Antioch, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> or Syrian, and speculation was carried on in Greek. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> held steadfastly by tradition. Under these circumstances, when <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> had passed away with their "conjugations" of Divine powers, and "emanations" from the Supreme unknowable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (the "Deep" and the "Silence") all speculation was thrown into the form of an inquiry touching the "likeness" of the Son to His Father and "sameness" of His Essence. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had always maintained that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was truly the Son, and truly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They worshipped Him with divine honours; they would never consent to separate Him, in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> or reality, from the Father, Whose Word, Reason, Mind, He was, and in Whose Heart He abode from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But the technical terms of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> were not fully defined; and even in Greek words like essence (<em>ousia</em>), substance (<em>hypostasis</em>), nature (<em>physis</em>), <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (<em>hyposopon</em>) bore a variety of meanings drawn from the pre-Christian <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, which could not but entail misunderstandings until they were cleared up. The adaptation of a vocabulary employed by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was a matter of time; it could not be done in a day; and when accomplished for the Greek it had to be undertaken for the Latin, which did not lend itself readily to <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> yet subtle distinctions. That disputes should spring up even among the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> who all held one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, was inevitable. And of these wranglings the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a> would take advantage in order to substitute for the ancient creed his own inventions. The drift of all he advanced was this: to deny that in any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could have a Son; as <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> tersely said afterwards, "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> neither begets, nor is He begotten" (<a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>, 112). We have learned to call that denial <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarianism</a>. It was the ultimate scope of Arian opposition to what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had always believed. But the Arian, though he did not come straight down from the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, pursued a line of argument and taught a view which the speculations of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> had made familiar. He described the Son as a second, or inferior <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, standing midway between the First Cause and creatures; as Himself made out of nothing, yet as making all things else; as existing before the worlds of the ages; and as arrayed in all divine perfections except the one which was their stay and foundation. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone was without beginning, unoriginate; the Son was originated, and once had not existed. For all that has origin must begin to be.

<p>Such is the genuine <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Arius. Using Greek terms, it denies that the Son is of one essence, nature, or substance with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; He is not consubstantial (<a href="../cathen/07449a.htm"><em>homoousios</em></a>) with the Father, and therefore not like Him, or equal in dignity, or co-eternal, or within the real sphere of Deity. The Logos which St. John exalts is an attribute, Reason, belonging to the Divine nature, not a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> distinct from another, and therefore is a Son merely in figure of speech. These consequences follow upon the principle which Arius maintains in his letter to <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>, that the Son "is no part of the Ingenerate." Hence the Arian sectaries who reasoned <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> were styled <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Anomoeans</a>: they said that the Son was "unlike" the Father. And they defined <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as simply the Unoriginate. They are also termed the Exucontians (<em>ex ouk onton</em>), because they held the creation of the Son to be out of nothing.



<p>But a view so unlike tradition found little favour; it required softening or palliation, even at the cost of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which supplanted Arianism from an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> affirmed the likeness, either without adjunct, or in all things, or in substance, of the Son to the Father, while denying His co-equal dignity and co-eternal existence. These men of the Via Media were named <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>. They approached, in strict argument, to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> extreme; but many of them held the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, however inconsistently; their difficulties turned upon language or local prejudice, and no small number submitted at length to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> attempted for years to invent a compromise between irreconcilable views, and their shifting creeds, tumultuous councils, and worldly devices tell us how mixed and motley a crowd was collected under their banner. The point to be kept in remembrance is that, while they affirmed the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> to be everlasting, they imagined Him as having become the Son to create the worlds and redeem <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Among the ante-Nicene writers, a certain ambiguity of expression may be detected, outside the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, touching this last head of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. While <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers held the Monarchia, viz. that there was only one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the Trinity, that this Absolute One existed in three distinct subsistences; and the Circumincession, that Father, Word, and Spirit could not be separated, in fact or in thought, from one another; yet an opening was left for discussion as regarded the term "Son," and the period of His "generation" (<em>gennesis</em>). Five ante-Nicene Fathers are especially quoted: <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>, <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">Theophilus of Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, whose language appears to involve a peculiar notion of Sonship, as though It did not come into being or were not perfect until the dawn of creation. To these may be added <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and Methodius. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> held that their view, which is found clearly in <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, of the Son existing after the Word, is connected as an antecedent with Arianism. <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a> construed the same expressions in a reprehensible sense; but the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Bishop <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> defended them as <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, not without difficulty. Even if metaphorical, such language might give shelter to unfair disputants; but we are not answerable for the slips of teachers who failed to perceive all the consequences of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> really held by them. From these <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> theorizings <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Alexandria kept aloof. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> himself, whose unadvised speculations were charged with the guilt of Arianism, and who employed terms like "the second <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," concerning the Logos, which were never adopted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; this very <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> taught the eternal Sonship of the Word, and was not a <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a>. To him the Logos, the Son, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a> were one ever-subsisting Divine Person, begotten of the Father, and, in this way, "subordinate" to the source of His being. He comes forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the creative Word, and so is a ministering Agent, or, from a different point of view, is the First-born of creation. <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> (260) was even denounced at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for calling the Son a work or creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but he explained himself to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> principles, and confessed the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">Homoousian</a> Creed.
<h2>History</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>, who was contemporary with Dionysius, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, may be judged the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> ancestor of those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which relegated <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> beyond the Divine sphere, whatever epithets of deity they allowed Him. The man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, said Paul, was distinct from the Logos, and, in Milton's later language, by merit was made the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. The Supreme is one in Person as in Essence. Three councils held at Antioch (264-268, or 269) condemned and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Samosatene</a>. But these Fathers would not accept the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">Homoousian</a> formula, dreading lest it be taken to signify one material or abstract substance, according to the usage of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a>. Associated with Paul, and for years cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion, we find the well-known Lucian, who edited the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> and became at last a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. From this learned man the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Antioch drew its inspiration. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius the historian</a>, <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>, and Arius himself, all came under Lucian's influence. Not, therefore, to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and its mystical teaching, but to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, where <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> flourished with his <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and its tendency to <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, should we look for the home of an aberration which had it finally triumphed, would have anticipated <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, reducing the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Eternal Son</a> to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and thus undoing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> revelation.

<p>Arius, a Libyan by descent, brought up at Antioch and a school-fellow of <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, took part (306) in the obscure Meletian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the church called "Baucalis," at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and opposed the Sabellians, themselves committed to a view of the Trinity which denied all real distinctions in the Supreme. Epiphanius describes the heresiarch as tall, grave, and winning; no aspersion on his moral character has been sustained; but there is some possibility of personal differences having led to his quarrel with the patriarch Alexander whom, in public synod, he accused of teaching that the Son was identical with the Father (319). The actual circumstances of this dispute are obscure; but Alexander condemned Arius in a great assembly, and the latter found a refuge with <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> historian, at Caesarea. Political or party motives embittered the strife. Many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> took up the defence of their "fellow-Lucianist," as Arius did not hesitate to call himself. Synods in Palestine and Bithynia were opposed to <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. During several years the argument raged; but when, by his defeat of Licinius (324), Constantine became master of the Roman world, he determined on restoring <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order in the East, as already in the West he had undertaken to put down the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> at the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a>. Arius, in a letter to the Nicomedian <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, had boldly rejected the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But Constantine, tutored by this worldly-minded man, sent from <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> to Alexander a famous letter, in which he treated the controversy as an idle dispute about words and enlarged on the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of peace. The emperor, we should call to mind, was only a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>, imperfectly acquainted with Greek, much more incompetent in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and yet ambitious to exercise over the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a dominion resembling that which, as Pontifex Maximus, he wielded over the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> worship. From this Byzantine conception (labelled in modern terms Erastianism) we must derive the calamities which during many hundreds of years set their mark on the development of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">Christian dogma</a>. Alexander could not give way in a matter so vitally important. Arius and his supporters would not yield. A council was, therefore, assembled in <a href="../cathen/11043a.htm">Nicaea</a>, in Bithynia, which has ever been counted the first ecumenical, and which held its sittings from the middle of June, 325. (See <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">FIRST COUNCIL OF NICAEA</a>). It is commonly said that <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius of Cordova</a> presided. The Pope, St. Silvester, was represented by his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, and 318 Fathers attended, almost all from the East. Unfortunately, the acts of the Council are not preserved. The emperor, who was present, paid religious deference to a gathering which displayed the authority of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> in a manner so remarkable. From the first it was evident that Arius could not reckon upon a large number of patrons among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Alexander was accompanied by his youthful <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, the ever-memorable <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> who engaged in discussion with the heresiarch himself, and from that moment became the leader of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> during well-nigh fifty years. The Fathers appealed to tradition against the innovators, and were passionately <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>; while a letter was received from <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>, declaring openly that he would never allow <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be of one substance with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This avowal suggested a means of discriminating between <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> believers and all those who, under that pretext, did not hold the Faith handed down. A creed was drawn up on behalf of the Arian party by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> in which every term of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and dignity, except the oneness of substance, was attributed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. Clearly, then, no other test save the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">Homoousion</a> would prove a match for the subtle ambiguities of language that, then as always, were eagerly adopted by dissidents from the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A formula had been discovered which would serve as a test, though not simply to be found in Scripture, yet summing up the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of St. John, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, "I and the Father are one". Heresy, as <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> remarks, had furnished from its own scabbard a weapon to cut off its head. The <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">"consubstantial"</a> was accepted, only thirteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> dissenting, and these were speedily reduced to seven. <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius</a> drew out the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> statements, to which <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> were subjoined against those who should affirm that the Son once did not exist, or that before He was begotten He was not, or that He was made out of nothing, or that He was of a different substance or essence from the Father, or was created or changeable. Every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> made this declaration except six, of whom four at length gave way. <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a> withdrew his opposition to the Nicene term, but would not sign the condemnation of Arius. By the emperor, who considered <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> as rebellion, the alternative proposed was subscription or banishment; and, on political grounds, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> was exiled not long after the council, involving Arius in his ruin. The heresiarch and his followers underwent their sentence in <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>. But these incidents, which might seem to close the chapter, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a beginning of strife, and led on to the most complicated proceedings of which we read in the fourth century. While the plain Arian creed was defended by few, those political <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who sided with <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius</a> carried on a double <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against the term <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">"consubstantial"</a>, and its champion, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>. This greatest of the Eastern Fathers had succeeded Alexander in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> (326). He was not more than thirty years of age; but his published writings, antecedent to the Council, display, in thought and precision, a mastery of the issues involved which no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teacher could surpass. His unblemished life, considerate temper, and loyalty to his friends made him by no means easy to attack. But the wiles of <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius</a>, who in 328 recovered Constantine's favour, were seconded by <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> intrigues, and a period of Arian reaction set in. Eustathius of Antioch was deposed on a charge of <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a> (331), and the Emperor sent his command that <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> should receive Arius back into communion. The saint firmly declined. In 325 the heresiarch was absolved by two councils, at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the former of which deposed <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> on <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and shameful grounds of personal misconduct. He was banished to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and his sojourn of eighteen months in those parts cemented Alexandria more closely to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> West. Meanwhile, <a href="../cathen/04294a.htm">Constantia</a>, the Emperor's sister, had recommended Arius, whom she thought an injured man, to Constantine's leniency. Her dying words affected him, and he recalled the Lybian, extracted from him a solemn adhesion to the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and ordered Alexander, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Imperial City, to give him Communion in his own church (336). Arius openly triumphed; but as he went about in parade, the evening before this event was to take place, he expired from a sudden disorder, which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could not help regarding as a judgment of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, due to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. His death, however, did not stay the plague. Constantine now favoured none but Arians; he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in his last moments by the shifty <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>; and he bequeathed to his three sons (337) an empire torn by dissensions which his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and weakness had aggravated.

<p><a href="../cathen/16027c.htm">Constantius</a>, who nominally governed the East, was himself the puppet of his empress and the palace-ministers. He obeyed the Eusebian faction; his <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>, Valens, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mursa, did what in him lay to infect <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the West with Arian <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. The term "like in substance", <em>Homoiousion</em>, which had been employed merely to get rid of the Nicene formula, became a watchword. But as many as fourteen councils, held between 341 and 360, in which every shade of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> subterfuge found expression, bore decisive witness to the need and efficacy of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> touchstone which they all rejected. About 340, an Alexandrian gathering had defended its <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in an epistle to Pope Julius. On the death of Constantine, and by the influence of that emperor's son and namesake, he had been restored to his people. But the young prince passed away, and in 341 the celebrated Antiochene Council of the Dedication a second time degraded <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, who now took refuge in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There he spent three years. Gibbon quotes and adopts "a judicious observation" of Wetstein which deserves to be kept always in mind. From the fourth century onwards, remarks the German scholar, when the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> were almost equally divided in eloquence and ability between contending sections, that party which sought to overcome made its appearance in the Vatican, cultivated the Papal majesty, conquered and established the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> creed by the help of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Therefore it was that <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> repaired to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. A stranger, Gregory, usurped his place. The Roman Council proclaimed his innocence. In 343, Constans, who ruled over the West from <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> to Britain, summoned the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to meet at <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> in Pannonia. Ninety-four Latin, seventy Greek or Eastern, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> began the debates; but they could not come to terms, and the Asiatics withdrew, holding a separate and hostile session at Philippopolis in Thrace. It has been justly said that the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> reveals the first symptoms of discord which, later on, produced the unhappy <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of East and West. But to the Latins this meeting, which allowed of appeals to Pope Julius, or the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, seemed an epilogue which completed the Nicene legislation, and to this effect it was quoted by <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> in his correspondence with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa.

<p>Having won over Constans, who warmly took up his cause, the invincible <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> received from his Oriental and <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> sovereign three letters commanding, and at length entreating his return to Alexandria (349). The factious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Ursacius and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>, retracted their charges against him in the hands of Pope Julius; and as he travelled home, by way of Thrace, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, the crowd of court-prelates did him abject homage. These men veered with every wind. Some, like <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>, held a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonizing</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which they would not give up, though they declined the Arian <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>. But many were time-servers, indifferent to <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. And a new party had arisen, the strict and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Homoiousians, not friends of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, nor willing to subscribe to the Nicene terms, yet slowly drawing nearer to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> creed and finally accepting it. In the councils which now follow these good men play their part. However, when Constans died (350), and his <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> brother was left supreme, the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> redoubled in <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. By a series of intrigues the Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were persuaded to cast him off at Arles, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Ariminum</a>. It was concerning this last council (359) that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> wrote, "the whole world groaned and marvelled to find itself Arian". For the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were driven by threats and chicanery to sign concessions which at no time represented their genuine views. Councils were so frequent that their dates are still matter of controversy. Personal issues disguised the dogmatic importance of a struggle which had gone on for thirty years. The Pope of the day, <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> at first, undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, but torn from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and banished to the dreary solitude of Thrace, signed a creed, in tone <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> (compiled chiefly from one of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>), renounced <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, but made a stand against the so-called "Homoean" formulae of <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Ariminum</a>. This new party was led by <a href="../cathen/01081a.htm">Acacius of Caesarea</a>, an aspiring churchman who maintained that he, and not <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, was <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> over Palestine. The <a href="../cathen/01079b.htm">Homoeans</a>, a sort of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, would have no terms employed which were not found in Scripture, and thus evaded signing the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">"Consubstantial"</a>. A more extreme set, the "Anomoeans", followed A&euml;tius, were directed by <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomius</a>, held meetings at Antioch and <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, declared the Son to be "unlike" the Father, and made themselves powerful in the last years of <a href="../cathen/16027c.htm">Constantius</a> within the palace. George of Cappadocia <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> retired into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> among the solitaries. <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius</a> had been compelled by torture to subscribe a fashionable creed. When the vacillating Emperor died (361), <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>, known as the Apostate, suffered all alike to return home who had been exiled on account of religion. A momentous gathering, over which <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> presided, in 362, at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, united the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> with himself and the West. Four years afterwards fifty-nine Macedonian, i.e., hitherto anti-Nicene, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> gave in their submission to <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Emperor Valens</a>, a fierce <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, still laid the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> waste.

<p>However, the long battle was now turning decidedly in favour of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a>. Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, like <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary of Poitiers</a> and <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">Eusebius of Vercellae</a> banished to <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> for holding the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, were acting in unison with <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, the two St. Gregories <span class="stiki">of <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Nyssa</a> and <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Nazianzus</a> --<em>Ed.</em></span>, and the reconciled <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>. As an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> movement the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> had spent its force. <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, governed the whole Empire. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> died in 373; but his cause triumphed at Constantinople, long an Arian city, first by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>, then in the Second General Council (381), at the opening of which <a href="../cathen/10161b.htm">Meletius of Antioch</a> presided. This saintly man had been estranged from the Nicene champions during a long <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; but he made peace with <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, and now, in company of <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, represented a moderate influence which won the day. No deputies appeared from the West. Meletius died almost immediately. <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>, who took his place, very soon resigned. A creed embodying the Nicene was drawn up by <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, but it is not the one that is chanted at Mass, the latter being due, it is said, to <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The Council became ecumenical by acceptance of the Pope and the ever-orthodox Westerns. From this moment Arianism in all its forms lost its place within the Empire. Its developments among the barbarians were political rather than <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a>. <a href="../cathen/15120c.htm">Ulphilas</a> (311-388), who translated the Scriptures into Maeso-Gothic, taught the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> across the Danube an <a href="../cathen/01079b.htm">Homoean</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; Arian kingdoms arose in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The Gepidae, Heruli, <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, Alans, and Lombards received a system which they were as little capable of understanding as they were of defending, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the sword of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, the action of the Papacy, made an end of it before the eighth century. In the form which it took under Arius, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomius</a>, it has never been revived. Individuals, among them are Milton and Sir Isasc Newton, were perhaps tainted with it. But the <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinian</a> tendency out of which <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarian</a> doctrines have grown owes nothing to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Antioch or the councils which opposed Nicaea. Neither has any Arian leader stood forth in history with a character of heroic proportions. In the whole story there is but one single hero &#151; the undaunted <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> &#151; whose mind was equal to the problems, as his great spirit to the vicissitudes, a question on which the future of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> depended.
