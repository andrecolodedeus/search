<h1>Aribo</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. 6 April, 1032; son of Arbo, Count Palatine in Laubenthal, and Adela, and one of the most important <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> of his time. Choosing an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career, he became successively <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in the church of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to his kinsman, the Emperor, Henry II, who appointed him to the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Archbishopric of Mainz</a>. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place 1 October, 1021, with great pomp. The following year he revived the famous Gandersheim controversy which concerned the rival claims of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Gandersheim, situated on the boundary between the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, but from time immemorial subject to Hildesheim. Having advanced his claims without success in the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfurt</a> (1027) and Poehlde (1029), Aribo finally renounced them in Merseburg (1030), admitting his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and promising future silence. Aribo figured prominently in the politics of the time. On the death of Henry II, which brought the male line of the Saxon emperors to an end, the spiritual and temporal princes of the empire assembled to elect a new sovereign, and it was Aribo's candidate who was chosen, under the title of Conrad II, and was anointed by him in <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. The powerful discourse preached on this occasion shows the deep spirituality of Aribo's nature. Under Conrad he filled the office of chancellor for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. There are records of two journeys to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the first to the Lateran Council (1027) and the second just before his death. He finished the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Goess in Styria begun by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and devoted earnest efforts to the rebuilding and decoration of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which had been destroyed by fire in 1009. It was Aribo who obtained for the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>. His internal administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was most energetic and capable. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the reform of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> is evidenced by the Council of Seligenstadt which he convened in the first year of his episcopate (August, 1022). Later he practically reorganized the archdiocese. His interest in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> prompted him to summon Ekkehard IV of St. Gall to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. His own <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers were of no mean order as is manifested by his taste for poetry and his own treatise on "The Fifteen Gradual Psalms," whence he is termed in his epitaph <em>suavis psalmigraphus</em>. Aribo's contemporaries unite in praise of his character &mdash; his disinterestedness and capability. Despite the brusqueness of his nature and the severity of his discipline, he enjoyed the confidence and respect of his suffragans. His moral character has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unimpeachable.
