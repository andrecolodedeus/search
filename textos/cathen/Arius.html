<h1>Arius</h1>  

<p>An heresiarch, born about A.D.&uacute; died 336. He is said to have been a Libyan by descent. His father's name is given as Ammonius. In 306, Arius, who had learnt his religious views from Lucian, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Antioch, and afterwards the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, took sides with Meletius, an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, against Peter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. But a reconciliation followed, and Peter <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> Arius <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Further disputes led the Bishop to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> his restless churchman, who, however, gained the friendship of Achillas, Peter's successor, was made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> by him in 313, and had the charge of a well-known district in Alexandria called Baucalis. This entitled Arius to expound the Scriptures officially, and he exercised much influence when, in 318, his quarrel with Bishop Alexander broke out over the fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> divine Sonship and substance. (See <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">ARIANISM</a>.) While many Syrian <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> followed the innovator, he was condemned at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in 321 by his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> in a synod of nearly one hundred <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> and Libyan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Deprived and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, the heresiarch fled to Palestine. He addressed a thoroughly unsound statement of principles to <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>, who yet became his lifelong champion and who had won the esteem of Constantine by his worldly accomplishments. In his house the proscribed man, always a ready writer, composed in verse and prose a defence of his position which he termed "Thalia". A few fragments of it survive. He is also said to have published songs for sailors, millers, and travellers, in which his creed was illustrated. Tall above the common, thin, ascetical, and severe, he has been depicted in lively colours by Epiphanius (Heresies, 69, 3); but his moral character was never impeached except doubtfully of <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> by Theodoret. He must have been of great age when, after fruitless negotiations and a visit to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, he appeared in 325 at Nicaea, where the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he presented was torn in pieces. With his writings and followers he underwent the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> subscribed by more than 300 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He was banished into Illyricum. Two <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> shared his fate, Tehonas of Marmarica and Secundus of Ptolemais. His books were burnt. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, joined by their old Meletian friends, created troubles in <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius</a> persuaded Constantine to recall the exile by indulgent letters in 328; and the emperor not only permitted his return to Alexandria in 331, but ordered <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> to reconcile him with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> refusal more disturbance ensued. The packed and partisan Synod of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> deposed <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> on a series of futile charges in 335. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were now <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>; Arius had an interview with Constantine and submitted a creed which the emperor judged to be <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. By imperial rescript Arius required Alexander of Constantinople to give him Communion; but the stroke of Providence defeated an attempt which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> looked upon as sacrilege. The heresiarch died suddenly, and was buried by his own people. He had winning manners, an evasive style, and a disputatious temper. But in the controversy which is called after his name, Arius counted only at the beginning. He did not represent the tradition of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> but the topical subtleties of Antioch. Hence, his disappearance from the scene neither stayed the combatants nor ended the quarrel which he had rashly provoked. A party-theologian, he exhibited no features of genius; and he was the product, not the founder, of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.
