<h1>Arizona</h1>  

<p>Said to have been, probably in the original form of the word, <em>Arizonac</em>, and in this form a Pima (Indian) word of which the meaning is unknown. With perhaps less probability there has been assigned to the word a Spanish origin. The motto of Arizona is <em>Ditat Deus</em>. It is one of the continental territories of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>, bounded on the north by the <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">State of Utah</a>, on the south by the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Republic of Mexico</a>, on the east by the Territory of <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, and on the west by the States of <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> and Nevada, between latitude 31&#176; and 37&#176; N, and longitude 109&#176; and 115&#176; W.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The region embraced in the Territory was ceded to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> by Mexico, a portion in 1848, by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and the remainder in 1854, by the Gadsden treaty. Until 1863, this region was part of the Territory of <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, and at the time of its acquisition by the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, Indians were almost the only inhabitants of this country, reputed to be rich in precious metals. Among those who flocked to the new domain were fugitives from <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> expelled by the Vigilance Committee of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, and Mexicans of a degraded class. The history of the early years following the cession is a sad record of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and general lawlessness among the white inhabitants, and of deplorable Indian troubles. "Murder and other crimes are committed with impunity," is the statement of President Buchanan to Congress in 1858, when repeating his recommendation of 1857 that a territorial government be established, a statement and recommendation which he reiterated in 1859. Examining the causes of the Indian troubles, the traveller, Raphael Pumpelly, contrasts the selfish aims of the frontiersmen with the missionary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who had formerly laboured in Spanish America, and their success in elevating the condition of the Indians, a success whose limit "was always determined by the cupidity of the home government, and of the mining population." Quite contrary to the fact, a report prevailed about the time of the cession, that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> themselves had worked mines in the region during the former years. Although <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> conditions continued, the Territory of Arizona was not established by law until 1863. In 1864 the new Territory was invaded by the forces of the Southern Confederacy which v. ere defeated by volunteer troops of <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. Internal disorders did not cease on the organization of a territorial government. In 1870 the Territory was much harried by Indians, and in 1871 its Governor declared that "all the Arizonians felt discouraged." Even in 1882, President Arthur conveyed to Congress the report of the Governor of Arizona that <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> prevailed. This condition was at that time largely attributed to "Cow-boys," and Indian disturbances were prevalent for some years thereafter.
<h2>Population, climate, resources, etc.</h2>

<p>The Territory's seat of government, temporarily established in 1864 at Prescott, was, in 1867, fixed at <a href="../cathen/15084b.htm">Tucson</a>, and, in 1877, transferred to Prescott again. Phoenix is the present capital. The twelfth <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> census, besides 24,644 Indians, reports a population, in 1900, of 122,931. By the census of 1860 the population of Arizona, then a county of <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, appears to have been only 6,482. Of the population In 1900, there were 98,698 natives and 24,233 foreigners. Of <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> descent there were 1,848. Including in the list those who could only read, with those who could neither read nor write, 25.4 per cent of the males of voting age were illiterate. Of males 15 years of age and over, 49.5 per cent were single, 43.6 per cent married, and 0.7 per cent <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>. Of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> 15 years of age and over, 21 per cent were single, 64.8 per cent married and 1 per cent <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>.

<p>According to the report of the chief of the Weather Bureau, the highest temperature observed at any weather station in Arizona during the year 1903 was 120&#176;, the lowest 18&#176; Two stations report each of these extremes. The smallest rain-fall reported for the same year from any station is 0.80 of an inch, the greatest 25.05 inches. In October, 1903, a trace of snow is reported at one station; there is no report of snow in November at any station, and for the following six months, to May, 1904, inclusive, the greatest fall reported is 41.4 inches, two stations reporting only a alight fall of snow. Agriculture is greatly dependent upon irrigation. Limited by supply of water for irrigation, the area of farming land is probably 2,000,000 acres out of 72,000,000. About 40,000,000 acres, or more than one-half the area of the Territory, are available for grazing lands of superior quality. Mines of gold, of silver, of copper, and of coal are to be found in the Territory. Of manufacturing establishments there were 169 in the year 1905, with a capital of $14,395,654. The value of products was $28,083,192. The value of the products of smelting and refining copper comprise 81.1 per cent of the total of all industries, and these, with cars and general shop construction and repairs by steam railroad companies, flour and grist-mill products, lumber and timber products, are the four leading industries. There are 1,509 miles of railroads. (See Council Memorial No. 1, Appendix B, in The Revised Statutes of Arizona Territory, 1901, p. 1511.) The assessed valuation of taxable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> for the year 1900 is stated to have been $33,782,465.99.
<h2>Territorial government</h2>

<p>In the same manner as for other Territories of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, the governor of Arizona is appointed by the President. A legislative assembly elected by counties meets every two years. There is no <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> suffrage except at elections of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> trustees. A Bill of Rights provides that the civil and political <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of no <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> are to be enlarged or abridged on account of his opinions or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> concerning religious matters. It is also provided by law that no <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> shall be incompetent to testify as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> on account of religion opinions or for want of religion <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. An elaborate system of public-school <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is established by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. There are a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and two normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and more than 15,000 children are <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. (See above cited Memorial.) Among the "powers and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>" of boards of trustees of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> districts, a statute mentions the excluding "from <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of all books, publications or papers of a sectarian, partisan or denominational character." No books, tracts or papers of a sectarian character are to be used in or introduced into any public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, nor "any sectarian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> taught therein." No <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> funds are to be received by "any <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> whatever under the control of any <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denomination</a>." A teacher is subject to revocation of certificate or diploma "who shall use any sectarian or denominational books or teach any sectarian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, or conduct any religious exercises in his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>."
<h2>Church in Arizona</h2>

<p>In 1850, <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, having been ceded to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, was made a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> and entrusted to the Right Rev. John B. Lamy, formerly a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Diocese of Cincinnati</a>. On his arrival, as he stated to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> in 1865 when referring to conditions happily passed away, he found in the vast vicariate twenty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, neglectful and extortionate, churches in ruins, and no <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In 1853 <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> was erected into the <a href="../cathen/13457a.htm">Diocese of Santa Fe</a>, and Dr. Lamy became its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The territory added to the national domain by the Gadsden treaty, in 1854, was placed under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and he, in 1859, sent Very Rev. J. P.  Macheboeuf to Tucson. Until a crude <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> could be erected Mass was said there in a private house. In 1863, two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> undertook the mission, and one of these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> "revived <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>," to quote the words of Dr. John Gilmary Shea, "at the splendid old church of <a href="../cathen/13464b.htm">San Xavier del Bac</a>" (the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of which seems to have been laid in 1783), "long a solitary monument in a wilderness, the neighbouring inhabitants having been driven off by hostile Indians." During the Civil War <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs continued peaceful, and in 1865 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> reported to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> an estimated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of five thousand in Arizona, and a great improvement in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. In 1868, Rev. J. B. Salpointe vas appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Arizona, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Doryla, 20 June, 1869. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> was erected into the <a href="../cathen/15084b.htm">Diocese of Tucson</a> in 1897, the Rev. P. Bourgade, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13457a.htm">Santa Fe</a>, becoming its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> comprises the whole Territory, 112,920 square miles, with a portion, amounting to 18,292 square miles, of <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>. In the diocese there are 25 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 11 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 21 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 31 missions with churches, and 95 stations, 6 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> and 4 Indian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the total of young people <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions being 2000. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is about 40,000. A law of the Territory, passed in 1903, permits "any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> being the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, president, trustee in trust, president of stake, overseer, presiding elder, rabbi, or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> of any church or religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>" to become a corporation sole "with continual perpetual succession." (For ARIZONA MISSIONS, see <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">NEW MEXICO</a>.)
<h2>Supplement</h2>

<p><em>[Note: The following update appeared in a later supplement to the Catholic Encyclopedia.]</em>

<p>On 12 Feb., 1912, Arizona became a state, the forty-eighth of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> ("America", 4 Jan., 1913; "Official Congressional Directory", 3rd ed., April, 1912). The Constitution of the state (61st Congress, 3rd session, Senate, 31 Jan., 1911) defines its boundaries as Mexico, <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>, <a href="../cathen/10775a.htm">Nevada</a>, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, and the Mexican Territory of Lower California (art. I). Phoenix is to be the state capital, subject to change by election on or after 31 Dec., 1925 (art. XX). The governor is to be elected for a term of two years (art. V); the legislature is to meet biennially (art. IV, sect. 3); the judiciary is elective (art. VI). The Constitution, as amended by vote, 5 Nov., 1912, extends the right of suffrage to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> ("American Year Book", 1912, p. 182; Constitution, art. VII, sect. 1). It defines the "initiative" and "referendum" to be "reserved powers" of the people (art. IV, sect. 1), and the right of "recall" includes judges as well as all other public officers (Constitution, art. VIII, sect. 1). There is to be no religious qualification for public office or employment (art. II), and to every inhabitant there is to be secured "perfect toleration of religious sentiment" without molestation in person or <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> on account of religious worship or its lack. "Polygamous or plural marriages or polygamous cohabitation are forever prohibited" (art. XX). Under the "general and uniform public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system" (art. XI, sect. 1), there is to be "no sectarian instruction" or religious test or qualification required of teacher or pupil (art. XI, sect. 1). Neither public money nor <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is to be appropriated for or applied "to any religious worship, exercise or instruction or to the support of any religious establishment" (art. II), nor is any tax to be laid or appropriation made of public money "in aid of any church or private or sectarian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>" (art. IX, sect. 10). But "property of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, charitable and religious associations or institutions not used or held for profit may be exempted from taxation by law" (art. IX, sect. 2). Statistics of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Arizona are given in the articles <a href="../cathen/15084b.htm">TUCSON</a> and <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">UNITED STATES</a>; according to the "Bureau of the Census, Religious Bodies, 1906" there were in the state 6175 <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Latter-Day Saints</a>, 2884 <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a>, 2667 <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a>, 1034 <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a>, 1059 <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Protestant Episcopalians</a>.
