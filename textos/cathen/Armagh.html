<h1>Armagh</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> about 445, as the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The Archdiocese of Armagh at present comprises almost the whole of the counties Armagh and Louth, a great part of Tyrone, and portions of Derry and of <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a>. It is divided into fifty-five <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, two of which, Armagh and Dundalk, are mensal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The Diocesan Chapter, re-established in 1856, consisted in 1906 of thirteen members, including a dean, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a>, chancellor, treasurer, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and canons. Diocesan <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 139; regulars, 39; <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 156; primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 227; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population (1901), 147,358. The suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> are <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a>, <a href="../cathen/01699c.htm">Ardagh</a>, <a href="../cathen/04059c.htm">Clogher</a>, <a href="../cathen/04742a.htm">Derry</a>, <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Down and Connor</a>, <a href="../cathen/05160a.htm">Dromore</a>, <a href="../cathen/08642a.htm">Kilmore</a>, Raphoe.

<p><a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, having received some grants of land from the chieftain Daire, on the hill called Ard-Macha (the Height of Macha), built a stone church on the summit and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and some other <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">religious edifices</a> round about, and fixed on this place for his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>. He also founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the same place, which soon became famous and attracted thousands of scholars. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> other religious bodies settled in Armagh, such as the Culdees, who built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> there in the eighth century. The city of Armagh was thus until modern times a purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> establishment. About 448, <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, aided by Secundinus and Auxilius, two of his disciples, held a synod at Armagh, of which some of the canons are still extant. One of these expressly mentions that all difficult cases of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> should be referred to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Armagh, and that if too difficult to be disposed of by him with his counsellors they should be passed on to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> times, the primacy of Armagh was never questioned, and for many centuries the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> were accustomed to make circuits and visitations through various parts of the country for the collection of their dues. This was called the "Cattlecess", or the "Law of St. Patrick". Beginning in 734, during the incumbency of Primate Congus, it continued till long after the English invasion, but ceased as soon as <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Two kings gave it their royal sanction: Felim, King of Munster, in 822, and the famous Brian Boru, in 1006. The record of the latter's sanction is preserved in the Book of Armagh, in the handwriting of Brian Boru's <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. To add solemnity to their collecting tours, the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> were in the habit of carrying with them the shrine of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, and as a rule their success was certain. These collections seem to have been made at irregular intervals and were probably for the purpose of keeping up the famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Armagh, said at one time to contain 7,000 students, as well as for the restoration, often needed, of the church and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings when destroyed by fire or plundered in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> annals record no fewer than seventeen burnings of the city, either partial or total. It was plundered on numerous occasions by the Danes and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> driven out of it. It was also sacked by De Courcy, Fitz-Aldelm and Philip of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> during the conquest of Ulster by the Anglo-Normans.

<p>The seizure of the primacy of Armagh by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> in the eleventh century has received great prominence owing to <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard's</a> denunciation of it in his life of <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a>, but the abuse was not without a parallel on the continent of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The chiefs of the tribe in whose territory Armagh stood usurped the position and temporal emoluments of the primacy and discharged by deputy the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions. The abuse continued for eight generations until Cellach, known as St. Celsus (1105-29), who was intruded as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, had himself <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and ruled the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> with great wisdom. In 1111 he held a great synod at Fiadh-Mic-Aengus at which were present fifty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 300 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 3,000 other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, and also Murrough O'Brian, King of southern <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and his nobles. During his incumbency the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul at Armagh was re-founded by Imar, the learned preceptor of <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a>. This was the first establishment in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> into which the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> had been introduced. Roderic O'Connor, monarch of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, afterwards granted it an annual pension for a public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. After a short interval, Celsus was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a> O'Morgair (1134-37), who later suffered many tribulations in trying to effect a reformation in the diocese. He resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> after three years and retired to the Bishopric of Down. In 1139 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and solicited the Pope for two <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">palliums</a>, one for the See of Armagh and the other probably for the new Metropolitan See of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>. The following year he introduced the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a> into <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, by the advice of St. Bernard. He died at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, while making a second journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a> is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Gelasius succeeded him and during a long incumbency of thirty-seven years held many important <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> which effected great reforms. At the Synod of Kells, held in 1152 and presided over by Cardinal Paparo, the Pope's <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Gelasius received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> and at the same time three others were handed over to the new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>. The successor of Gelasius in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, Cornelius Mac Concaille, who died at Chambery the following year, on a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, has been <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> ever since in that locality as a saint. He was succeeded by Gilbert O'Caran (1175-80), during whose incumbency the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> suffered greatly from the depredations of the Anglo-Norman invaders. William Fitz-Aldelm pillaged Armagh and carried away <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick's</a> <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, called the "Staff of Jesus". O'Caran's successor was Thomas O'Conor (1181-1201). In the year after his succession to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, Pope Lucius III, at the instance of John Comyn, the first <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> in the See of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, tried to abolish the old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> custom according to which the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> claimed the right of making solemn circuits and visitations in the province of Leinster as well as those of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a> and Munster. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> bull issued was to the effect that no <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should hold any assembly or <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Diocese of Dublin</a>, or treat of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> causes and affairs of the said diocese, without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, if the latter were actually in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, unless specially authorized by the Papal See or the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic legate</a>. This <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> laid the groundwork of a bitter and protracted controversy between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Armagh and of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, concerning the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> right of the former to have his cross carried before him and to try <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> cases in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of the latter. This contest, however, must not be confounded with that regarding the primacy, which did not arise till the seventeenth century.


<h2>English period (1215-1539)</h2>

<p>As the first Anglo-Norman adventurers who came to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> showed very little scruple in despoiling the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, Armagh suffered considerably from their depredations and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were almost reduced to beggary. When the English kings got a footing in the country, they began to interfere in the election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and a contest arose between King John and the Pope regarding Eugene Mac Gillaweer, elected to the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> see in 1203. This <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was present at the General Council of the Lateran in 1215 and died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the following year. The English kings also began to claim possession of the temporalities of the sees during vacancies and to insist on the newly-elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> suing them humbly for their restitution. Primate Reginald (1247-56), a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, obtained a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> uniting the county of Louth to the See of Armagh. Primate Patrick O'Scanlan (1261-70), also a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, rebuilt to a large extent the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Armagh and founded a house for <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in that city. Primate Nicholas Mac Maelisu (1272-1302) signalized himself by convening an important assembly of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> at <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a> in 1291, at which they bound themselves by solemn <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> to resist the encroachments of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. Primate Richard Fitz-Ralph (1346-60) contended publicly both in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with the Mendicant Friars on the question of their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and privileges. A contest regarding the primacy of Armagh was carried on intermittently during these centuries by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> and Cashel, especially the former as the city of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> was the civic <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the kingdom. During the English period, the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> rarely visited the city of Armagh, preferring to reside at the arch-episcopal manors of Dromiskin and Termonfechan, in the county of Louth which was within the Pale. During the reign of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, Primate Cromer, being suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, was deposed in favour of Robert Wauchope (1539-51), a distinguished <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, who assisted at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. In the meantime, <a href="../cathen/05145a.htm">George Dowdall</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> supporter of Henry, had been intruded into the See of Armagh by that monarch, but on the introduction of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> into <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in the reign of Edward VI, he left the kingdom in disgust. Thereupon the king in 1552, appointed Hugh Goodacre to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. He was the first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who assumed the title of Primate and enjoyed the temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In the beginning of the reign of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, <a href="../cathen/05145a.htm">Dowdall</a> (1553-58) was appointed by the Pope to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on account of the great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he had shown against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, though at the same time, he had acted in a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> way.
<h2>Period of persecution</h2>

<p>After the short incumbency of Donagh O'Tighe (1560-62), the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was filled by <a href="../cathen/04469b.htm">Richard Creagh</a> (1564-85), a native of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a> . He was arrested by order of Queen Elizabeth and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by her in the Tower of London, where he was tortured and maltreated and left to languish in captivity for eighteen years till his death. Edward Mac Gauran, who succeeded him (1587-94), was very active in soliciting aid from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the king of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> who were then engaged in a struggle for liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> with the English Queen. After an interval of eight years, he was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/09336a.htm">Peter Lombard</a> (1601-25), one of the most learned men of his time. He remained in exile, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, during the whole twenty-four years of his incumbency and thus never once visited his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Hugh Mac Cawell, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> abroad for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1626, but died before he could reach it. <a href="../cathen/11294b.htm">Hugh O'Reilly</a>, the next <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> (1628-53), was very active in the political movements of his day. In 1642, he summoned the Ulster <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to a synod at <a href="../cathen/08615a.htm">Kells</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> then carried on by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> was declared lawful and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>. He took a prominent part in the Confederation of Kilkenny and was appointed a member of the Supreme Council of twenty-four <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who carried on the government of the country in the name of King Charles I. After the defeat and death of most of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> chieftains he was elected generalissimo of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> forces and prolonged the heroic though hopeless conflict. <a href="../cathen/11293c.htm">Edmund O'Reilly</a> (1657-69) succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, but owing to the difficulties of the time was only able to spend two years in the diocese out of the twelve of his incumbency. He was exiled on four different occasions. During the whole time he spent in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he was hiding in woods and caves and never had any bed but a cloak thrown over straw. He suffered a great deal from the machinations of the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> Father Walsh, the author of the "Loyal Remonstrance" (1661, 1672) to King Charles II, and died in exile in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>The next <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> was the <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Venerable Oliver Plunket</a> (1669-81), the cause of whose <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> is at present being promoted. Shortly after his accession to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to defend the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Armagh against the claims put forward for Dublin by its <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/14432c.htm">Dr. Peter Talbot</a>. At a meeting of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in Dublin in 1670, each of these <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> refused to subscribe subsequent to the other. <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Dr. Plunket</a> thereupon wrote a work on the ancient <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and prerogatives of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, published in 1672, under the title "Jus Primatiale; or the ancient Pre-eminence of the See of Armagh above all the other Archbishops in the Kingdom of Ireland, asserted by O. A. T. H. P". This was replied to two years later by <a href="../cathen/14432c.htm">Dr. Talbot</a> in a dissertation styled "Primatus Dublinensis; or the chief reasons on which the Church of Dublin relies in the possession and prosecution of her right to the Primacy of Ireland". A violent <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> stilled the controversy for some time and subsequent <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> asserted their authority from time to time in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. In 1719 two Briefs of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> were in favour of the claims of Armagh. Still the matter was not allowed to rest and Dr. Hugh Mac Mahon felt compelled to write a work treating the subject exhaustively in answer to an anonymous pamphlet published by Father John Hennessy, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> of Clonmel. Dr. Mac Mahon's work, written under great difficulties, appeared in 1728 under the title of "Jus Primatiale Armacanum; or the Primatial Right of Armagh over all the other Archbishops and Bishops and the entire clergy of Ireland, asserted by H. A. M. T. H. P". This learned work contains the last word on the subject and is conclusive. In practice, however, the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> right has fallen into desuetude in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> as in every other part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1679, <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Venerable Oliver Plunket</a> was arrested on a ridiculous charge of conspiring to bring 20,000 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> into the country and of having levied moneys on his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for the purpose of maintaining 70,000 men for an armed rebellion. After being confined in Dublin Castle for many months, he was presented for trial on these and other charges in Dundalk; but the jury, though all <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, refused to find a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bill against him. The venue, however, of his trial was changed by his enemies to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where he was tried by an English jury before he was able to gather his witnesses and bring them across, though he made the request to the judge. The principal witnesses against him were some disreputable <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> of Armagh whom he had censured and suspended for their bad conduct. He was dragged on a sledge to Tyburn on 1 July, 1681, where he was hanged, drawn, and quartered in presence of an immense multitude. His head, still in a good state of preservation, is in the possession of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Drogheda.
<h2>Penal times</h2>

<p>During this trying period, the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> had to live in the greatest obscurity in order to disarm the malice of the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Dominic Maguire (1683-1707), a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> after the death of the <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Venerable Oliver Plunket</a>. This <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, having to go into exile after the surrender of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a> in 1691, spent the sixteen years that intervened between that time and his death in a very destitute condition. In the meantime the See of Armagh was administered by a vicar, Patrick Donnelly, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, who in 1697 was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05160a.htm">Dromore</a>, though retaining the administration of Armagh for several years afterwards. His name occurs in the government register of the "popish <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>" of Armagh, made in 1704, as the pretended popish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of that part of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Newry that lies in the county of Armagh. The sureties for his good conduct were Terence Murphy of Lurgan and Patrick Guinnisse of the same town. Altogether the names of nineteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> appear on the register for the county of Armagh. From the returns made in 1731 by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> regarding the growth of popery in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, we find that in the Diocese of Armagh there were 26 Mass-houses, 77 officiating <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 5 friaries, 22 <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> with 9 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 7 private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and 40 popish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Owing to the severity of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> there was no <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> resident in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> for twenty-three years after the flight of Primate Maguire, in 1691. Hugh Mac Mahon (1714-37), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04059c.htm">Clogher</a>, was at last appointed to the bereft see. Living during the worst of the penal times, the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> constantly to wander from place to place, saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and administering Confirmation in the open air. Nevertheless, in spite of these difficulties he has left his name to posterity by the learned work "Jus Primatiale Armacanum", written by command of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in defence of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Armagh. He was succeeded by his nephew, Bernard Mac Mahon (1737-47), then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04059c.htm">Clogher</a>, who is described as a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> remarkable for <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, charity, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and sound <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. He also suffered considerably from the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and spent most of his time in hiding. Bernard was succeeded in the primacy by his brother, Ross Mac Mahon (1747-48), also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04059c.htm">Clogher</a>. Michael O'Reilly (1749-58), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04742a.htm">Derry</a>, was the next <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>. He published two catechisms, one in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and the other in English, the latter of which has been in use in parts of the north of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> till our own time. On one occasion this <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> and eighteen of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were arrested near Dundalk. He lived in a small thatched cottage at Termonfechan, and at times had to lie concealed in a narrow loft under the thatch. Anthony Blake (1758-86) was his successor. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> having subsided to a great extent, he was not harried like his predecessors, but nevertheless could not be induced to live permanently in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, a circumstance which was the occasion of much discontent among his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and led to a temporary suspension from his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Richard O'Reilly (1787-1818) was his successor in the primacy. Having an independent fortune, he was the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> since the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution</a> who was able to live in a manner becoming his dignified station. By his gentleness and affability he succeeded in quieting the dissensions which had distracted the diocese during the time of his predecessor and was thenceforward known as the "Angel of Peace". In 1793, he laid the foundation-stone of St. Peter's Church in Drogheda, which was to serve as his pro-cathedral, one of the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches to be built within the walls of a town in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>. The Protestant Corporation of Drogheda, wearing their robes and carrying the mace and sword, appeared on the scene and forbade the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> to proceed, but their protest was disregarded.
<h2>Modern times</h2>

<p>Patrick Curtis (1819-32), who had been <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> of Salamanca, was appointed to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in more hopeful times and lived to witness the emancipation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He was one of the first to join the Catholic Association, and being on friendly terms with the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15580a.htm">Wellington</a>, whom he had met in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> during the Peninsular War, was able to advance considerably the cause of Catholic Emancipation. Thomas Kelly succeeded (1832-35). He drew up the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> which are still in use in the diocese and lived and died with the reputation of a saint. <a href="../cathen/04514c.htm">William Crolly</a> succeeded (1835-49). He was the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> to reside in Armagh and perform episcopal functions there since the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> began, and signalized himself by beginning the noble <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which it has taken more than sixty years to bring to completion. The foundation-stone was laid 17 March, 1840, and before the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate's</a> death the walls had been raised to a considerable height. <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Paul Cullen</a> succeeded in 1849, but was translated to the See of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> in 1852. In 1850 he presided over the <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">National Synod</a> of Thurles, the first of the kind held in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> since the convention of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in Kilkenny, in 1642. <a href="../cathen/05069a.htm">Joseph Dixon</a> (1852-66), the next <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, held a synod in Drogheda in 1854, at which all the northern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assisted. In 1856, the Diocesan Chapter, consisting of thirteen members, was formed. <a href="../cathen/05069a.htm">Archbishop Dixon</a> resumed the building of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, but did not live to see it finished. Michael Kieran (1866-69) succeeded, residing in Dundalk during his tenure of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> see. His successor, Daniel Mac Gettigan (1870-87), spent three years of earnest labour in the completion of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and was able to open it for divine worship in 1873. The present illustrious occupant of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, Cardinal Michael Logue, succeeded to the primacy in 1887. He is the first <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Armagh to become a member of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. He has devoted himself for several years to the task of beautifying and completing in every sense the noble edifice erected by his predecessors. In the building of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, synod-hall, muniment-room, the purchase in fee-simple of the site, and the interior decorations and altars, he has spent more than &#163;50,000 on what is now known as the National Cathedral. This great temple was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 24 July, 1904. Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli, representing <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a>, was present at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.
<h2>Religious institutions in the archdiocese</h2>

<p>There is a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and an Augustinian friary in Drogheda, and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> have one founded by Primate Netterville in 1224. They also have one in Dundalk, established originally at Carlingford in the early part of the fourteenth century. Of the modern congregations, the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentians</a> were introduced into Armagh by <a href="../cathen/05069a.htm">Primate Dixon</a> in 1861, to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a>, also at <a href="../cathen/05069a.htm">Primate Dixon's</a> request, came to Dundalk the same year to conduct a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> were brought there by Primate Mac Gettigan in 1876. <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Primate Cullen</a> brought the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Irish Christian Brothers</a> to Armagh in 1851, <a href="../cathen/05069a.htm">Primate Dixon</a> brought them to Drogheda in 1857, and Primate Kieran to Dundalk in 1869. The French Congregation of <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers (de la Salle)</a> have <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in Dundalk, Keady, and Ardee. The <a href="../cathen/12399b.htm">Presentation Brothers</a> have <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Dungannon. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Nuns, invited to Drogheda in 1722 by Primate Hugh Mac Mahon, conduct a boarding-school and a day-school. The Presentation Nuns, who settled in Drogheda in 1813, and in Portadown in 1882, have large poor <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in both towns. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, also devoted to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, came to Dundalk in 1847, to Ardee in 1859, and to Dungannon in 1894. They also have <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at Bessbrook and Cookstown. The <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a> came to Drogheda in 1855, where they conduct an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for little boys and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for girls. The Ladies of the Sacred Heart were brought to Armagh by <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Primate Cullen</a> in 1850. There is a missionary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls attached to their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. There is a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> at Keady, one of St. Louis at Middletown, and one of the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception at Magherafelt, all recent foundations. The Academy of St. Patrick, Dungannon, is conducted by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Diocesan Orphan Society is under the direction of the Primate.
<h2>Protestant archbishops</h2>

<p>Hugh Goodacre, the first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who presided over the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was appointed by Edward VI, in 1552. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> ordinal and survived his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> only three months. Adam Loftus (1563-67), from whom the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> claim to derive their orders, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Hugh Curwin, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, according to the form annexed to the second <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a> of the time of Edward VI. The most learned of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> was James Ussher (1625-56), whose most important works were "Veterum Epistolarum Hibernicarum Sylloge", published in 1632, and "Brittanicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates", which appeared in 1639. He left his valuable <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, comprising several thousand printed books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, to Trinity College, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and his complete works were published by that institution in twenty-four volumes at the cost of 3,000. In spite of his learning, this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate's</a> character was marked by a most intolerant spirit of bigotry against the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. His judgment against toleration of Papists, i.e. "to consent that they may freely exercise their religion and profess their faith and doctrine is a grievous sin", was a signal for the renewal of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and led to the Rising of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in 1641. John Bramhall (1660-63), another learned <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> divine, succeeded Ussher. His works on polemic and other subjects have been published in four folio volumes. Narcissus March (1702-13), another learned <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, built the noble <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of St. Sepulchre's in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, which bears his name, filled it with a valuable collection of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and Oriental works and liberally endowed it for the support of a librarian and deputy. Hugh Boulter (1724-42), John Hoadly (1742-46), and George Stone (1746-64) are principally famous as politicians and upholders of the "English Interest" in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The first two supported and promoted the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but Stone was opposed to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Richard Robinson, first Baron Rokeby (1765-94), raised Armagh by his munificence from extreme decay to a state of opulence and embellished it with various useful public institutions. He built an episcopal palace, a public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, an infirmary, and an observatory. Lord John George Beresford (1822-62) was also distinguished by his munificence. He restored Armagh Cathedral at a cost of 34,000 and is said to have spent 280,000 in acts of public benevolence. On his successor, Marcus Gervais Beresford (1862-65), fell a large portion of the task of providing for the future organization and sustentation of the Protestant Episcopal Church in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, which was disestablished from 1 January 1871. After the flight of the Earls O'Neill and O'Donnell, large portions of their forfeited estates were made over to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> see, which, together with the land previously belonging to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> times, made up a total of 100,563 acres, producing in modern times a gross revenue for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of 17,670. By the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Temporalities' Act of 1833, this was considerably reduced, and the net income of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> before the disestablishment was 12,087. Since that event the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> receives an annual salary from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Representative Body of 2,500, with the palace free of rent. The <a href="../cathen/06582a.htm">glebe</a> lands belonging to the eighty-eight <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in the diocese comprised 19,290 acres. Since disestablishment, about 9,000 are contributed annually by the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> system for sustentation funds and about 5,000 for various other Church purposes. Before disestablishment, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a> formed twenty-two per cent of the population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a> seventeen per cent, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> sixty-one per cent, a proportion which has remained almost the same ever since. The non-Catholic population in 1901 was 100,451.
