<h1>Armand-Jean du Plessis, Duke de Richelieu</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>; French statesman, b. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 5 September, 1585; d. there 4 December 1642. At first he intended to follow a military career, but when, in 1605, his brother Alfred resigned the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/09413a.htm">Lu&ccedil;on</a> and retired to the Grande Chartreuse, Richelieu obtained the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from Henry IV and withdrew to the country to take up his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies under the direction of Bishop Cosp&eacute;an of <a href="../cathen/01237a.htm">Aire</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on 17 April, 1607; he was not yet twenty-two years old, although the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 19 December, 1606, announcing his appointment contains the statement: "in vigesimo tertio aetatis anno tantum constitutus". Mgr. Lacroix, the historian of Richelieu's youth, believes that in a journey made to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the end of 1606, Richelieu deceived the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as to his age, but the incident is still obscure. In his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Richelieu showed great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and appointed the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> to give missions in all the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Richelieu represented the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Poitou in the States General of 1614, where his political career began. There he was the mouth-piece of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in a celebrated discourse demanded that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> be summoned to the royal councils, that the distribution of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> be forbidden, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be exempt from taxation, that <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who usurped churches or had their coreligionists <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in them be punished, and that the Decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> be <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He ended by assuring the young king Louis XIII that the desire of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was to have the royal power so assured that it might be "comme un ferme rocher qui brise tout ce qui gheurte" (as a firm rock which crushes all that opposes it).

<p>Richelieu was named secretary of state on 30 November, 1616, but after the assassination of Concini, favourite of Maria de' Medici, he was forced to leave the ministry and follow the queen mother to Blois. To escape the political intrigues which pursued him he retired in June, 1617, to the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Coussay and, during this time of leisure caused by his disgrace, published in October, 1617 (date confirmed by Mgr. Lacroix), his "Les principaux points de la foi de l'&eacute;glise catholique, d&eacute;fendus contre l'&eacute;ecrit adress&eacute; au Roi par les quartre ministres de Charenton"; it was upon reading this book half a century later that Jacques de Coras, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Tonneins, was converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Richelieu continued to be represented to the king as an enemy to his power; the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, Leclerc du Tremblay, never succeeded in completely clearing him in Louis XIII's opinion. To disarm suspicion Richelieu asked the king to name a place of exile, and at his order went in 1618 to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where he passed nearly a year and where he composed a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> which became famous under the name of "Instruction du chr&eacute;tien". This book, destined to be read in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> each Sunday at the sermon, was a real blessing at a time when <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of religion was the principal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. When Maria de' Medici escaped from <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> in 1619, Richelieu was chosen by the minister Luynes to negotiate for peace between Louis XIII and his mother. By <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 3 November, 1622, he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>. On 19 April, 1624, he re-entered the Council of Ministers, and on 12 August, 1624, was made its president. Richelieu's policy can be reduced to two principal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>: the domestic unification of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and opposition to the House of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. At home he had to contend with constant conspiracies in which Maria de' Medici, Queen Anne of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Gaston d'Orl&eacute;ans (the king's brother), and the highest nobles of the court were involved. The executions of Marillac (1632), Montmorency (1632), Cinq-Mars and of de Thou (1642) intimidated the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. He had also to contend with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who were forming a state within the state (see <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">HUGUENOTS</a>). The capitulation of <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a> and the peace of Alais (28 June, 1629) annihilated <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> as a political party.

<p>Richelieu's foreign policy (<em>for which see</em> <a href="../cathen/09108a.htm">LECLERC DU TREMBLAY</a>) was characterized by his fearlessness in making alliances with the foreign <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. At various times the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of the Grisons, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and Bernard of Saxe-Weimar were his allies. The favourable treaties signed by <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> were the result of Richelieu's policy of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> alliances, a policy which was severely censured by a number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. At the end of 1625, when Richelieu was preparing to give back Valteline to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Grisons, the partisans of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> called him "Cardinal of the Huguenots", and two pamphlets, attributed to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Eudemon Joannes and Jean Keller, appeared against him; these he had burned. Hostilities, however, increased until finally the king's confessor opposed the foreign policy of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. This was a very important episode, and on it the recent researches of Father de Rochemonteix in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> have cast new light. <a href="../cathen/03467a.htm">Father Caussin</a>, author of "La Cour Sainte", the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> whom Richelieu, on 25 March, 1636, had made the king's confessor, tried to use against the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> the influence of <a href="../cathen/08738b.htm">Mlle. de La Fayette</a>, a lady for whom the king had entertained a certain regard and who had become a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>. On 8 December, 1637, in a solemn interview <a href="../cathen/03467a.htm">Caussin</a> recalled to the king his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> towards his wife, Anne of Austria, to whom he was too indifferent; asked him to allow his mother, Maria de' Medici, to return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; and pointed out the dangers to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> which might arise through Richelieu's alliance with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. After this interview <a href="../cathen/03467a.htm">Caussin</a> gave Communion to the king and addressed him a very beautiful sermon, entreating him to obey his directions. Richelieu was anxious that the king's confessor should occupy himself solely with "giving absolutions", consequently, on 10 December, 1637, <a href="../cathen/03467a.htm">Caussin</a> was dismissed and exiled to <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, and his successor, <a href="../cathen/14027c.htm">Father Jacques Sirmond</a>, celebrated for his historical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, was forced to promise that, if he saw "anything censurable in the conduct of the State", he would report it to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and not attempt to influence the king's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. However, <a href="../cathen/03467a.htm">Father Caussin's</a> fears concerning Richelieu's foreign policy were not shared by all of his confr&egrave;res. Father Lallemand, for instance, affirmed that it was rash to blame the king's political alliance with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes &#151; an alliance which had been made only after an unsuccessful attempt to form one with <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.



<p>That Richelieu was possessed of religious sentiments cannot be contested. It was he who in February, 1638, prompted the declaration by which Louis XIII <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>; in the ministry he surrounded himself with <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious; as general he employed Cardinal de la Valette; as admiral, Sourdis, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>; as diplomat, <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">B&eacute;rulle</a>; as chief auxiliary he had Leclerc du Tremblay. He himself designated <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> his successor. He had a high <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> dignity, was continually protesting against he encroachments of the parlements on the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and advised the king to choose as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only those who should "have passed after their studies a considerable time in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, the places established for the study of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions". He wished to compel the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to reside in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, to establish <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> there, and to visit their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. He aided the efforts of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> to induce the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to institute the "exercises des ordinants", retreats, during which the young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were to prepare themselves for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Richelieu foresaw the perils to which nascent <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> would expose the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran's</a> doctrines on the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, his views on the organization of the "great Christian Republic", his liaison with <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> (who in 1635 had composed a violent pamphlet against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under the names of <em>Mars gallicus</em>), and the manner in which he opposed the annulment of the marriage of Gaston d'Orl&eacute;ans, drew upon him the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> suspicion. In having him arrested 14 May, 1638, Richelieu declared that "had <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> been confined before they had begun to dogmatize, the states would have been spared many troubles". Two months later Richelieu forced the solitaries of Port Royal-des-Champs to disperse; some were sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, others to Ferte-Milon. <a href="../cathen/05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran</a> remained in the dungeon of Vincennes until the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> death. With the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Gregoire Tarisse, Richelieu devoted himself seriously to the reform of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. Named coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny in 1627, and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny in 1629, he called to this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the Reformed <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of Saint-Vannes. He proposed forming the congregations of Saint-Vannes and <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Saint-Maur</a> into one body, of which he was to have been superior. Only half of this project was accomplished, however, when in 1636 he succeeded in uniting the Order of Cluny with the <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Congregation of Saint-Maur</a>. From 1622 Richelieu was <em>proviseur</em> of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, and was in virtue of this office head of the Association of Doctors of the Sorbonne. He had the Sorbonne entirely rebuilt between 1626 and 1629, and between 1635 and 1642 built the church of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, in which he is now buried.

<p>On the question of the relations between the temporal and the spiritual powers, Richelieu really professed the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> called Duvalism after the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Duval, who admitted at the same time the supreme power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the supreme power of the king and the divine right of both. In the dissensions between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Gallicans he most frequently acted as mediator. When in 1626 a book by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Sanctarel appeared in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, affirming the right of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to depose kings for wrong-doing, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, or incapacity, it was burned in the Place de Greve; Father Coton and the three superiors of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> houses summoned before the Parlement were forced to repudiate the work. The enemies of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> wished immediately to create a new disturbance on the occasion of the publication of the "Somme theologique des v&eacute;rit&eacute;s apostoliques capitales de la religion chr&eacute;tienne", by Father Garasse, but Richelieu opposed the continued agitation. It was, however, renewed at the end of 1626, owing to a thesis of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> T&ecirc;tefort, which maintained that the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> formed part of the Scripture. Richelieu again strove to allay feeling, and in a discourse (while still affirming that the king held his kingdom from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone) declared that "the king cannot make an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> unless this article has been so declared by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in her oecumenical councils". Subsequently, Richelieu gave satisfaction to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> when on 7 December,1 629, he obtained a retraction from the Gallican Edmond Richer, syndic of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, who submitted his book "La puissance ecclesiastique et politique" to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Nine years alter, however, Richelieu's struggles against the resistance offered by the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to taxes led him to assume an attitude more deliberately Gallican. Contrary to the theories which he had maintained in his discourse of 1614 he considered, now that he was a minister, that the needs of the State constituted a case of <em>force majeure</em>, which should <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to submit to all the fiscal exigencies of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. As early as 1625 the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, tired of the incessant demands of the Government for money, had decreed that no deputy could vote supplies without having first received full powers on the subject; Richelieu, contesting this principle, declared that the needs of the State were actual, while those of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were chimerical and arbitrary.

<p>In 1638 the struggle between the State and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> on the subject of taxes became critical, and Richelieu, to uphold his claims, enlisted the aid of the brothers Pierre and Jacques Dupuy, who about the middle of 1638 published "Les libert&eacute;s de l'&eacute;glise gallicane". This book established the independence of the Gallican Church in opposition to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> only to reduce it into servile submission to the temporal power. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> complained; eighteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled at the house of Cardinal de la Rouchefoucald, and denounced to their colleagues this "work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>". Richelieu then exaggerated his fiscal exigencies in regard to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; an edict of 16 April, 1639, stipulated that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and communities were incapable of possessing landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, that the king could compel them to surrender their possessions and unite them to his domains, but that he would allow them to retain what they had in consideration of certain indemnities which should be calculated in going back to the year 1520. In Oct., 1639, after the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of an equerry of Marshal d'Estrees, the French Ambassador, Estrees declared the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the people violated. Richelieu refused to receive the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> (October, 1639); a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the royal council, 22 December, restrained the powers of the pontifical Briefs, and even the canonist Marca proposed to break the Concordat and to hold a national council at which Richelieu was to have been made patriarch. Precisely at this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> Richelieu had a whole series of grievances against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> had refused successively to name him Legate of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Legate of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>; he had refused the purple to Father Joseph, and had been opposed the annulment of the marriage of Gaston d'Orl&eacute;ans. But Richelieu, however furious he was, did not wish to carry things to extremes. After a certain number of polemics on the subject of the taxes to be levied on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> assembly of Mantes in 1641 accorded to the Government (which was satisfied therewith) five and a half millions, and Richelieu, to restore quiet, accepted the dedication of Marca's book "La concorde du sacerdoce et de l'empire", in which certain exceptions were taken to Dupuy's book. At the same time the sending of <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> as envoy to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, and the presentation to him of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat put an end to the differences between Richelieu and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>Upon the whole, Richelieu's policy was to preserve a just mean between the parliamentary Gallicans and the Ultramontanes. "In such matters", he wrote in his political testament, "one must believe neither the people of the palace, who ordinarily measure the power of the king by the shape of his crown, which, being round, has no end, nor those who, in the excesses of an indiscreet <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, proclaim themselves openly as partisans of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>". One may believe that Pierre de Marca's book was inspired by him and reproduces his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. According to this book the liberties of the Gallican Church have two foundations: (1) the recognition of the primacy and the sovereign authority of the Church of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a primacy consisting in the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to judge without appeal, and to be judged neither by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> nor by councils; (2) the sovereign right of the kings which knows no superior in temporal affairs. It is to be noted that Marca does not give the superiority of a council over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as a foundation of the Gallican liberties. (For Richelieu's work in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> see article <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">CANADA</a>.) In 1636 Richelieu founded the Academie Fran&ccedil;aise. He had great literary pretensions, and had several mediocre plays of his own composition produced in a theatre belonging to him. With a stubbornness inexplicable today Voltaire foolishly denied that Richelieu's "Testament politique" was authentic; the researches of M. Hanotaux have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> its authenticity, and given the proper value to admirable chapters such as the chapter entitled, "Le conseil du Prince", into which Richelieu, says M. Hanotaux, "has put all his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and his genius".
