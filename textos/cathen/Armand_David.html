<h1>Armand David</h1>  

<p>Missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and zoologist, b. 1826; d. 1900. He entered the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a> in 1848, having already displayed great fondness for the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> in 1862, he was shortly afterwards sent to Peking, and began there a collection of material for a museum of natural history, mainly zoological, but in which botany and geology and <a href="../cathen/11410a.htm">pal&aelig;ontology</a> were also well represented. At the request of the French Government important specimens from his collection were sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and aroused the greatest interest. The Jardin des Plantes commissioned him to undertake scientific journeys through <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> to make further collections. He succeeded in obtaining many specimens of hitherto unknown animals and plants, and the value of his comprehensive collections for the advance of systematic zoology and especially for the advancement of animal geography received universal recognition from the scientific world. He himself summed up his labours in an address delivered before the International Scientific Congress of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in April, 1888. He had found in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> altogether 200 species of wild animals, of which 63 were hitherto unknown to zoologists; 807 species of birds, 65 of which had not been described before. Besides, a large collection of reptiles, batrachians, and fishes was made and handed over to specialists for further study, also a large number of moths and insects, many of them hitherto unknown, were brought to the museum of the Jardin des Plantes. What Father David's scientific journeys meant for botany may be inferred from the fact that among the rhododendrons which he collected no less than fifty-two new species were found and among the <em>primul&aelig;</em> about forty, while the Western Mountains of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> furnished an even greater number of hitherto unknown species of gentian. The most remarkable of hitherto unknown animals found by David was a species of bear (<em>ursus melanoleucus</em>, the black-white bear) which is a connecting link between the cats and bears. Another remarkable animal found by him received the scientific name of <em>elaphurus davidianus</em>. Of this animal the Chinese say that it has the horns of the stag, the neck of the camel, the foot of the cow, and the tail of the ass. It had disappeared with the exception of a few preserved in the gardens of the Emperor of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, but David succeeded in securing a specimen and sent it to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In the midst of his work as a naturalist Father David did not neglect his missionary labours, and was noted for his careful devotion to his religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and for his obedience to every detail of his rules.
