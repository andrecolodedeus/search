<h1>Armand de La Richardie</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/11668a.htm">P&eacute;rigueux</a>, 7 June, 1686; died at Quebec, 17 March, 1758. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, 4 Oct., 1703, and in 1725 was sent to the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> mission. He spent the two following years helping Father Pierre Daniel Richer at <a href="../cathen/09360a.htm">Lorette</a>, and studying the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> language. In 1728 he went to Detroit to re-establish the long-interrupted mission to the dispersed <a href="../cathen/11784b.htm">Petun-Hurons</a> in the West. Not a solitary professing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> did he find, but among the aged not a few had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The new Indian church, though "seventy cubits long" (105ft?) was scarcely spacious enough to contain the fervent congregation of practising <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>. During the night, 24-25 March, 1746, the father was stricken with paralysis, and on 29 July he was placed in an open canoe and thus conveyed to Quebec.

<p>In 1747 the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> insisted on his returning to restore tranquillity to their nation. The father had almost completely recovered from his palsy, and willingly consented. He set out from <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> on 10 Sept., and reached Detroit on 20 Oct. From this date until 1751, leaving the loyal <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> in the keeping of Father Potier at the Detroit village, he directed all his energies to reclaiming Nicolas Orontondi's band of insurgent <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>. These had already in 1740, owing to a bloody feud with the Detriot Ottawas and to the reluctance, if not refusal, of Governor Beauharnais to let the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> remove to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, sullenly left Detroit and settled at "Little Lake" (now Rondeau Harbour) near Sandusky. There they had been won over to the English cause, had openly revolted in 1747, and had <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> a party of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>. Early in the spring of 1748 Orontondi (not Orontony) set fire to the fort and cabins at Sandusky, and withdrew to the Riviere Blanche, not far from the junction of the Ohio and Wabash Rivers. Until his death, which occurred some time after Sepember, 1749, Orontondi continued to intrigue with the English emissaries, the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, and the disaffected Miamis. When there was no longer <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of the renegade leader's demise, de La Richardie resolved on a final attempt at conciliation. He had already at intervals spent months at a time among the fugitives, and now on Sept., 1750, at the peril of his life he started, with only three canoe men for the country of the 'Nicolites" as they were then termed. The greater number remained obdurate. It is the descendants of the latter who in July, 1843, removed from their lands at Upper Sandusky, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, to beyond the Mississippi, and now occupy the Wyandot reserve in the extreme north-eastern part of <a href="../cathen/11230c.htm">Oklahoma</a>. The father's failing strength <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> his superiors to recall him to Quebec in 1751, and on 30 June he bade a final farewell to the Detroit mission. From the autumn of 1751 until his death he filled various offices in Quebec College. His <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> name was Ondechaouasti.
