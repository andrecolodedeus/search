<h1>Armella Nicolas</h1>  

<p>Popularly known as "La bonne Armelle", a saintly French serving-maid held in high veneration among the people, though never <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, b. at Campeneac in Brittanny, 9 September, 1606, of poor peasants, George Nicolas and Francisca Neant; d. 24 October, 1671. Her early years were spent in the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, simple life of the hard-working country folk. When she was twenty-two years of age her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> wished her to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, but she chose rather to enter service in the neighboring town of Ploermel, where she found more opportunity for her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works and for satisfying her spiritual needs. After a few years she went to the larger town of <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, where she served in several <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and for a year and a half was portress at the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. She here formed a special friendship with a certain sister, Jeanne de la Nativite, to whom she told from time to time many details of her spiritual life, and who noted down these communications, and afterwards wrote the life of Armella, who could herself neither read nor write. Even the lowly work at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> did not satisfy her craving for toil and humiliation, and she returned to one of her former employers, where she remained to the end of her life. To her severe trials and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> she added many works of penance and was rewarded by the growth of her inner life and her intimate union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. During the last years of her life a broken leg caused her great suffering, patiently borne. Many recommended themselves to her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and her death-bed was surrounded by a great number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who held her in special veneration. Her heart was preserved in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church, and her body was buried in the church of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>. Near her grave was erected a tablet to "La bonne Armelle"; her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> is a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. Armella has been claimed, but without good grounds, as an exponent of <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietism</a>. If some of her expressions seemed tinged with <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietist</a> thought, it is because the controversy which cleared and defined many notions concerning <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietism</a> had not yet arisen. On the other hand her simple, laborious life and practical <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> make any such aberrations very unlikely.
