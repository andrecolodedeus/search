<h1>Armidale</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> situated in New South Wales (Australia), with its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Armidale, 335 miles north of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>. It is one of the six suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of the province of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>. Its boundary on the north is the Queensland border, on the east, the <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Diocese of Lismore</a>, on the west the <a href="../cathen/15620d.htm">Diocese of Wilcannia</a>, ten miles beyond Walgett, and on the south, the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/09555b.htm">Maitland</a> and <a href="../cathen/02349a.htm">Bathurst</a>. Area of Armidale Diocese, about 85,000 square miles. Armidale was not proclaimed a municipality till 1863. Ten years before that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> (in 1853) the Rev. Timothy McCarthy was appointed its first resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. It was then a sparsely populated agricultural and pastoral district, where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were few and far apart. Father McCarthy made Armidale his head-quarters, and (says <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>) "His missionary district embraced all the territory as far as the Queensland border, and extended to the Pacific Ocean. His periodical excursions lasted for three months. From the Tweed to the Richmond, thence to the Clarence and on to Walcha, then across the Liverpool Plains to the Gwydir, and back by way of Glen Innes and Tenterfield to Armidale. Such was the route which he traversed in the discharge of his ordinary <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>." He was afterwards transferred to the Carcoar district at a time when it was "in a ferment from the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and lawlessness of the bushrangers. He rendered a great service alike to the State and to those unhappy outlaws, many of whom he succeeded in withdrawing from their life of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and crime." He died in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1879. Till 1864 all New South Wales was under the spiritual charge of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>. In that and the following years were created the present Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/06683a.htm">Goulburn</a> (1864), Bathurst (1865), and Maitland (1867). Armidale (says <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>) "was also marked out for an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>," but it was not till 1869 that its first Bishop, the Right Rev. Timothy O'Mahony, was appointed. Till 1887 the diocese had a vast and unwieldy area, and at the time that the new Bishop entered into possession it had no railroad running through it, "and even the ordinary roads were few." The first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was a little wooden church 25 feet by 18, replaced by a brick and stone structure, opened in 1872, and measuring 102 feet by 32. Bishop O'Mahony's stay in Armidale was embittered by grave accusations that were fomented by a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> friend and given to the press and public by open enemies. He resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1878 and was appointed <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, where he died in 1892. He was succeeded by the Right Rev. Elzear Torreggiani (1879-1904), an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> who had been on the mission in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. In Australia, as in Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Dr. Torreggiani always wore the habit of his order. His first visitation of his straggling and difficult diocese occupied three years. The coast district was, in 1887, erected into the Diocese of Grafton (now known as the <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Diocese of Lismore</a>). A portion of the Maitland <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was at the same time added to that of Armidale. Dr. Torreggiani died, 28 January, 1904. He was succeeded by the Right Rev. Patrick Joseph O'Connor, who had been his coadjutor from 3 May, 1903.
