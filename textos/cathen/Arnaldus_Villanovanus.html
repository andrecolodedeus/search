<h1>Arnaldus Villanovanus</h1>  

<p>(ARNALDUS OF VILLANUEVA, or VILLENEUVE, or BACHUONE).

<p>Celebrated in his day as a physician, pharmacist, and <a href="../cathen/01272b.htm">alchemist</a>, b. between 1235 and 1240; d. at sea near <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, 1312 or 1313. Like much else connected with this very unusual man, most of the details of his life are obscure. The latinized form of his native town is Villanova; there were not a few towns of this name at that period in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Some identify it with Villanueva in <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>, Diocese of Valencia, others with Villeneuve-Loubet in the arrondissement of Grasse, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He died while on his way to visit the sick pontiff, <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>. Well versed in the classical languages, Hebrew, and Arabic, he also understood all that was then known of the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, especially medicine and pharmacology. At Barcelona he had John Casamila as teacher, thought highly of Galen, and among the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> cared only for Rhazes. He taught medicine, botany, and <a href="../cathen/01272b.htm">alchemy</a> at <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. His life was a wandering one; besides the cities just mentioned, he lived for considerable periods of time at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, Bologna, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and Palermo. He was considered superior to all other physicians and <a href="../cathen/01272b.htm">alchemists</a>, so that he was frequently summoned by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and princes. Thus he was at times at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Court during the reigns of <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a>, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>. He was also the personal physician of Pedro III and James II of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, Robert of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. He was repeatedly <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go from place to place because the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> sentenced him to banishment on account of his fantastic writing, which were at times <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. Owing to the large number of writings still extant bearing his name, some evidently spurious, others <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, it is not easy to judge Villanovanus. His reputation in <a href="../cathen/01272b.htm">alchemy</a> was excelled only by that of <a href="../cathen/12670c.htm">Raymond Lully</a>, who was regarded as his pupil. Modern criticism has assigned to an earlier age many chemical discoveries that were formerly ascribed to Villanovanus, as acids, alcohol, distillation etc. Yet a number of his works were very important in placing medicine and pharmacology on a scientific basis; besides an independent judgment they show ripe experience and great humanity. Although a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> he wrote much on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. His <a href="../cathen/01272b.htm">alchemistic</a> and <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrological</a> bent led him into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> opinions regarding the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Mass, <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, the end of the world, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The first complete edition of his works was issued at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1504, reissued at the same place in 1520 and 1532 (folio). The most complete edition is that of Taurellus (Basle, 1585), with a biography of Arnaldus. For the individual works see, in particular, Haser, op. cit. in bibliography below. Several of them were repeatedly reprinted before 1500.
