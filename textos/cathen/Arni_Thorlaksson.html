<h1>Arni Thorlaksson</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Icelandic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, b. in <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Iceland</a>, 1237; d. at <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Bergen</a>, 1297. While a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, he visited <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, in 1262, and became a friend of Bishop Magnus. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he was soon appointed administrator of the Diocese of Holar, and was conspicuous for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">law of celibacy</a>. He was assistant of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Skalholt, in 1267, and succeeded him in that office, being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1269 at Nidaros (Trondheim) in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Iceland</a>, he set about organizing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration. Since the regulation of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, in 1152, the Iceland <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had become suffragans of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of Nidaros. In 1264 Iceland became still more dependant politically on the king of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. Up to that time Iceland had been a republic, governed by the Althing, which was composed of forty-eight chiefs, ninety-six councillors, and an announcer of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> who was president. At the time <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced many of these chiefs built churches on their lands and assumed at the same time ecclsiastical administration of them. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> became identified with the State. The Althing, the legislative assembly in which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had seats, made <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in matters of the church and controlled church affairs. Arni Thorlaksson, confronted with this state of things, protected the church interests, and especially had to fight for the investiture of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the temporal administration of the churches and their effects. With this in view, he visited Norway in 1273, and obtained some concessions from the king. On his return to <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Iceland</a>, he proposed To the Althing (1275) a <em>Kristenret</em>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> law, with which his name is particularly associated. Some time after this the <em>jus patrontatus</em> (the right of patronage) revived, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> made an appeal to the arbitration of the king and of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Having arrived in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, in 1297, for this purpose, he succeeded in obtaining the compromise that where <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> owned more than half of a church they should retain its temporal management, but in every other case the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should have it. He died the same year at <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Bergen</a>. Although he had not obtained all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he at least secured its organization and uniformity, and, as far as <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> was concerned, such observance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as dependency on the kings of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> permitted. History regards him as the most, influential and important man of his time in Iceland.
