<h1>Arnold Ipolyi</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">Family</a> name originally STUMMER)

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07040a.htm">Grosswardein</a> (Nagy-V&aacute;rad), b. at Ipoly-Keszi, 20 Oct., 1823; d. at <a href="../cathen/07040a.htm">Grosswardein</a>, 2 December 1886. At the age of thirteen years he entered the ranks of the alumni of the <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Archdiocese of Gran</a> (Esztergom), studied two years in the Emericianum at Presburg (Pozsony) and later at Tyrnau (Nagy-Szombat), and finished at the Pazmaneum at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he attended lectures on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> for four years. In 1844 he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, took <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> in 1845, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1847. From 1845 to 1847 he acted as tutor in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Baron Medny&aacute;nszky, was then <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> at Komorn-Sankt-Peter (Kom&aacute;rom-Szen-P&eacute;ter), in 1848 preacher at Presburg, in 1849 spent a short time as tutor in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Count Palffy, and became in this year <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Zohor. Even before his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he concerned himself with historical and art-historical matters. In 1854 his "Ungarische Mythologic" came out, as the firstfruit of his work, in which he treats of the ancient religion of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Although the work won the prize offered by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the author afterwards withdrew it from the press, so that at the present time it is very rare. In 1860 Ipolyi became <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at T&ouml;r&ouml;k-Szent-Mikl&oacute;s. Accompanied by Franz Kubinyi and Emerich Henszlmann, he made in 1862 a journey to Constantinople, where he discovered the remainder of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias Corvinus</a>. In 1863 he was made canon of Eger, and in 1869 director of the Central Ecclesiastical Seminary at Pesth; in 1871 he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10774b.htm">Neusohl</a> (Besztereze-B&aacute;nya), and in 1886 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07040a.htm">Grosswardein</a> where he died on 2 December of the same year. Ipolyi was member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, as well as a member of different learned Societies at home and abroad. He was one of the founders and at first vice-president, then president of the Hungarian Historical Society. His literary activity extended into the provinces of history, art-history, archaeology, and <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a>. He enriched the Hungarian National Gallery with sixty valuable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. He bequeathed to Grosswardein in his will, for the purpose of founding a museum, his collections which had been brought together with a great expert <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of art. Of his literary works, in addition to his "Mythologie", the following are well known: "Biography of Michael Veresmarti", an author of the seventeenth century (Budapest, 1875); the "Codex epistolaris Nicolai Ol&aacute;h", in the "Monumenta Hungariae Historica: Scriptorum", XXV (Budapest, 1876); the "Biographie der Christina Ny&aacute;ry von Bedez" (Budapest, 1887), in Hungarian; also the "Historische und kunsthistorische Beschreibung der ungarischen Kronisignien" (Budapest, 1886), in Hungarian. A collection of his lesser works has appeared in five volumes (Budapest, 1887).
