<h1>Arnold of Brescia</h1>  

<p>(ARNALDUS, ARNOLDUS, ERNALDUS)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> towards the end of the eleventh century, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of death uncertain. If there is any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the statement made by <a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freisingen</a> that Arnold completed his studies under the direction of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, he must have gone to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> about 1115. This would explain the affection towards the French master which he showed later in life, and we could easily understand how it came about that <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> called him to his side after the Lateran Council of 1139, as <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> intimates he did. In the judgment of some critics, however, there is not sufficient evidence for this first sojourn of Arnold in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, vouched for by <a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freisingen</a> alone. Aspiring to a perfect life, Arnold at a tender age entered a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of canons regular in his native city where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and appointed prior or <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of his community. He was fitted for this high office by the austerity of his life, his detachment from earthly things, his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of religious discipline, the clearness of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and an originality and charm of expression that he brought to the service of a lofty ideal. <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> yielded to his powerful influence, and in the course of some years Arnold was placed at the head of the reform movement then stirring the city. Precisely at this time <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, like most other Lombard cities, was entering upon the exercise of its municipal liberties. The government was in the hands of two consuls elected annually, but over against their authority that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as principal landed proprietor, still remained. Hence arose between the rival forces inevitable conflicts in which were involved, together with political passions, the interests of religion. The sight of these conditions grieved Arnold and prompted him to apply a remedy. By constant dwelling on the evils which afflicted both city and Church, he came to the conclusion that their chief causes were the wealth of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Was it not best, therefore, to take drastic measures at once to strip the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of their wealth, and transfer it to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>? Was not this the surest and quickest method of satisfying the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> and of bringing back the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, by poverty, to the practice of <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">evangelical perfection</a>? To reduce this to a working theory, Arnold ventured to formulate the following propositions: "Clerics who own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who hold regalia [tenures by royal grant], and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who have possessions cannot possibly be saved. All these things belong to the [temporal] prince, who cannot dispose of them except in favour of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>."

<p>The welcome given such teachings by the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> may readily be inferred. <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> passed through an alarming crisis, the various phases of which, owing to the brevity and obscurity of the documents at our disposal, can be but vaguely traced. From the testimony of various authors, however, <a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freisingen</a>, St. Bernard, and <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> (supposed author of the "Historia Pontificalis"), the following facts are ascertained: a journey made by Bishop Manfred to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about 1138; an insurrection during his absence; the attempt of Arnold to prevent him on his return from taking possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> or temporal power; the appeal of the rebellious <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and his condemnation by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, at the Lateran Council, in 1139. Silence and exile were the penalties imposed on Arnold, and he was forbidden to return to <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> without the express permission of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>. The following year (1140) we find Arnold at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> at the side of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, who was about to make his last struggle against the champions of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. St. Bernard awaited steadfastly both combatants, whose attack was turned to utter rout. In the words of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clairvaux, the "squire" was involved in the downfall of the "knight." The sentence passed upon <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> by the council was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>. Arnold fared no better, for both were condemned to perpetual confinement in separate <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 16 July, 1140). This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, however, was never put into execution. While <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> took refuge with Peter the Venerable, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, Arnold feigned retirement to Mont Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where, however, he opened public courses of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. He had but few disciples, and these, according to <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, were so needy that they had to beg their daily bread. For that matter, however, this state of affairs accorded very well with the teachings of the new professor, who sharply censured the luxury of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the worldly possessions of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and stigmatized wealth as the real virus that was infecting the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Arnold's attacks did not stop here. He was constantly haunted by the memory of his condemnation, and pursued unscrupulously with his taunts the <a href="../cathen/04757a.htm">detractors</a> of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>. Thus he described the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clairvaux as a man "puffed up with vainglory, and jealous of all those who have won fame in letters or religion, if they are not of his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>." Thus boldly challenged, Bernard took up the gauntlet and denounced Arnold to Louis VII as "the incorrigible <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, the sower of discord, the disturber of the peace, the destroyer of unity," and brought it about that the "Most Christian King drove from the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>" him whom <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> had already exiled.

<p>Arnold, compelled to flee, took refuge in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and fixed his abode at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clairvaux continued active in pursuit, and some time afterwards (1143) we find the exile in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> begging protection from a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> named Guy. This <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> &mdash; who must not be confounded with his namesake, disciple of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> &mdash; received him with kindness and, touched by his misfortunes, treated him with great friendliness. This attitude vexed St. Bernard, who addressed to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> a discourse on <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which, however, remained unheeded by Guy. There is every reason to believe that Arnold had given his host pledges of sincere submission, for this fact alone would explain his return to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, thenceforth open to him. This, too, explains the solemn <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> which he made at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, before <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugenius III</a>, in 1145. The pontiff, on reconciling him with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, had imposed a form of penance then customary: <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, vigils, and <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the principal shrines of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Unfortunately, in the air which Arnold was about to breathe there were floating the germs of revolt. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was endeavouring to re-establish her Senate to the detriment of the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. A movement so thoroughly in keeping with the earlier thoughts and the secret desires of the repentant innovator could not but secure his sympathy and even his outspoken support. It was soon discovered that he was vilifying the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and disseminating from the Capital his plans for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform. The <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> became the chief object of his attacks; he depicted the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> as vile <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> and misers playing among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the role of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. He did not even spare the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Eugenius III, whose gentle moderation this terrible reformer had but recently acknowledged, was suddenly transformed into the executioner of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, more concerned "with pampering his own body, and filling his own purse than with imitating the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the Apostles whose place he filled." In particular, Arnold reproached the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for relying on physical force, and for "defending with <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a>" his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> when contested. Eugenius III was forced to leave the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, and for some time (1146-49) Roman democracy triumphed under Arnold of Brescia. Though <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (15 July, 1148), Arnold did not despair of his position. By degrees, however, his revolutionary programme took on another character. The abolition of the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was now only the first of his demands; the second contemplated the subordination of the spiritual to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. Wetzel, one of his disciples presumed to offer to King Conrad III the keys of the Castle of Sant' Angelo, so that the German emperors might have the future disposal of the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> and the government of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Arnold's policy, at first republican, thus ended in downright imperialism. <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, however, Conrad's successor, refused to support the schemes of the Roman agitators. With much cleverness and tact, Eugenius III won over the emperor to the cause of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Arnold was thus rendered helpless. The senatorial elections of November, 1152, had turned against him, and marked the beginning of his fall.

<p>Little is known of Arnold during the brief reign of Anastasius IV (July, 1153 - December, 1154), but the election of <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> was fatal to his cause. He had fallen into the hands of Odo, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of St. Nicholas <em>in carcere Tulliano</em>, but was freed by the Viscounts of Campagnatico, and found for some years a safe refuge in their territory. They "looked on him as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>" inspired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. However, as in an agreement between Adrian and <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> obtained the emperor's promise that he would seize the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Arnold and remove him, willing or unwilling, from the custody of the Viscounts of Campagnatico. Frederick did not hesitate to make and keep this promise, and accordingly Arnold was handed over to the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. It is quite difficult to give an exact account of the trial of Arnold. According to the story recorded by <a href="../cathen/06472a.htm">Gerhoh de Reichersperg</a>, he was secretly removed from the <a href="../cathen/12436a.htm">ecclesiastical prison</a> and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the servants of the prefect of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who had suffered great injuries from the revolution fomented by Arnold. It is very probable, however, that the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> had a larger share in his condemnation. One analyst goes so far as to say that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> personally ordered him to be hanged. Another writer affirms, with more semblance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that Adrian confined himself to demanding Arnold's degradation, so that he might be delivered over to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. According to the author of a poem recently discovered (and he seems to be well informed), Arnold when brought in sight of the gallows faced his death <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a>. When urged to recant his teachings, he answered that he had nothing to withdraw, and was ready to suffer death for them. He asked only for a brief respite to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and beg <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> pardon for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. After a short <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> he gave himself up to the executioner, and offered his head to the noose. After hanging from the gallows for a short time, his body was burned, and the ashes thrown into the Tiber, "for fear", says one chronicler, "lest the people might collect them and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> them as the ashes of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>."

<p>"Forger of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>," "sower of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>," "enemy of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>," "schismatic," "heretic," such are the terms used by <a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freisingen</a>, by the author of the "Historia Pontificalis," by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clairvaux, by Eugenius III, and <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> to stigmatize Arnold. Given the vagueness of these characterizations, it is not easy to specify the dogmatic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> into which the innovator fell. <a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freisingen</a> echoes a rumour according to which Arnold held offensive views on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the Eucharist. His contemporaries (notably St. Bernard, who pursued so bitterly the "squire" of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>) lay nothing of the kind to his charge. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Clairvaux in one of his letters accuses Arnold of being "an enemy of the Cross of Christ." But must we conclude from this that Arnold was a follower of Pierre de Bruys, who condemned the adoration of the Cross? It is much more probable that the words of St. Bernard are to be taken broadly or in a metaphorical sense. In reality it was in practical matters that Arnold showed himself inimical to the teachings accepted at his time. He began by condemning the abuses occasioned by the wealth of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a>, an act which in itself placed him in the class of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reformers; St. Bernard and <a href="../cathen/06472a.htm">Gerhoh de Reichersperg</a> said the same thing. But Arnold did not stop at this; he went so far as to deny the very principle of proprietary right as claimed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and thereby assailed the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. "All earthly possessions belong to the prince, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should relinquish the government of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> can own nothing without incurring the penalty of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>." On all these various points the innovator, to say the least, was plainly guilty of temerity. And since he clashed with a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> that was not prepared to sanction his views, he ended by questioning its authority. According to him, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had become corrupt in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of covetous and <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and was no longer the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church. "The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>," he says, "is no longer the real <em>Apostolicus</em>, and, as he does not exemplify in his life the teachings of the Apostles, there is no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of reverence and obedience towards him." The unworthy <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> lose the right of administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and the faithful need no longer confess" to them. It is sufficient that they confess to one another. If it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as stated by the anonymous author of the poem above quoted, that Arnold had fallen into these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> character of his teachings remains no longer <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. His disciples, i.e. those whom the thirteenth-century documents call the Arnoldists, or Arnaldists, taught other <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> no less serious, for which, however, Arnold cannot justly be held responsible.
