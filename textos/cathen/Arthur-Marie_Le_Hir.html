<h1>Arthur-Marie Le Hir</h1>  

<p>Biblical scholar and <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a>; b. at Morlaix (Finisterre), in the <a href="../cathen/12611a.htm">Diocese of Quimper</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 5 Dec., 1811; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 13 Jan., 1868. Entering the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Sulpice, Paris, in 1833, he joined the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> after <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. He was then made professor of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> and also of Hebrew, to which branches he had been thoroughly formed by Gamier, a scholar, says Renan, "who had a very solid <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of languages and the most complete <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> of any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>" (Souvenirs d'enfance et de jeunesse, 269). Le Hir continued in this teaching till his death, about thirty years later, and through his own work and that of his pupil, Renan, he influenced powerfully the revival of <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Biblical</a> and Oriental studies in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Renan regarded him as the best Hebrew and <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac</a> scholar of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in his generation, and one, moreover, who was thoroughly versed in Biblical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, including the current German works thereon, whose theories he exposed and strongly combatted. Some lay to his uncompromising attitude the defection of Renan, which was so harmful to religion in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was as eminent in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and modesty as in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and no doubt this contributed to the extraordinary impression he left upon his intimates, which his writings (partly because they are chiefly posthumous) fail to produce. Most students of his books would hesitate about accepting Renan's judgment, that he "was certainly the most remarkable man in the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of our day" (op. cit., 273). Le Hir published only a few articles, which, along with others, were collected, after his death, in the two volumes entitled "Etudes Bibliques", Paris, 1869. This work shows him at his best, in the range and solidity of his acquirements, and in the breadth of his views. His other writings, all posthumous, and not left by him ready for the press, are studies in the translation and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> of certain Biblical works: "Le Livrede Job" (Paris, 1873); "Les Psaumes" (Paris, 1876); "Les trois Grands Prophetes Isaie J&eacute;r&eacute;mie, Ez&eacute;chiel" (Paris, 1876); "Le Cantique des Cantiques" (Paris, 1888).

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">BERTRAND, Bibliotheque Sulpicienne, II (Paris, 1900), with a lengthy description of Le Hir's writings and references to articles concerning him cf. IDEM in VIG., Dict. de la Bible s.v.; RENAN, Souvenirs d'en d enfance et de jeunesse (Paris, 1883)221, 269, 274, 288; IDEM in Journal Asiatique, XIJ (Paris, 1568), 19; JULES SIMON Quatre Portraits (Paris, 1896), containing the reminscences --evidently mistaken-- of a pretended judgment of Renan upon Le Hir, totally at variance with that given in the Souvenirs and Journal Asiatique.</p></div>
