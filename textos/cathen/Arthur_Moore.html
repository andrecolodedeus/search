<h1>Arthur Moore</h1>  

<p>Count, b. at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, 1849; d. at Mooresfort, Tipperary, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1904, was the son of Charles Moore, M.P. for Tipperary. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw</a>, he afterwards travelled in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and in 1874 was elected M.P. for the Borough of Clonmel. In Parliament he was a follower of Mr. Butt, and strongly advocated land reform, better treatment of children in workhouses, <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and Home Rule; and he specially interested himself in providing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> for the navy. In 1877 he married a daughter of an English baronet, Sir Charles Clifford, and the same year received the title of Count from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. During Gladstone Parliament of 1880-85 Count Moore was usually on the side of Parnell. He favoured land purchase as the best settlement of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> question; he advocated the providing of suitable cottages for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> labourers, and better treatment of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> emigrants on board ship; he always voted for Home Rule, and vehemently denounced coercion. But he had no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in violent agitation, and did not favour the full programme of the Land League or that of the National League; and he voted for the second reading of Gladstone's Land Bill though Parnell and his friends abstained from voting. Count Moore would only follow where his convictions led, and he was too independent to be blindly obedient to Mr. Parnell; when the Redistribution Act of 1885 disfranchised Clonmel, he was left without a seat in Parliament. He had therefore no share in the scenes which followed the general election of 1885. But he was not content to lead a life of ease and inactivity, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that "a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> should be up and doing and not merely telling his beads in a corner". Blessed with ample wealth he was a generous contributor to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; a militant but not an aggressive <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> he was always ready to do battle for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and in speeches, lectures, and newspaper articles often did spendid service for the advancement of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. He spared no effort to secure that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sailors should not be left without religious instruction during life, or without a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the hour of death; and so valuable was his work in this that the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Bishops, at their meeting at <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth</a> in 1903, thanked him by special resolution. He supported the <a href="../cathen/15077a.htm">Catholic Truth Society</a> and attended meetings; he desired to have a branch of the Beneditine Order in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and would have helped to endow it. He established and generously endowed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey at Roscrea. Always ready to help others he did not forget his own personal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. He attended Mass every day, spent hours the tabernacle in his own private oratory, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> rigorously, made frequent retreats; and he went, year after year, to Lourdes and to the Holy Land, not a sight-seeing traveller but as a pilgrim and a penitent. At home he was the kindest and the most indulgent of landlords, and no beggar went unrelieved from his door. When he died, his body, clothed in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> habit, was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> near the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> in the church of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> at Roscrea.
