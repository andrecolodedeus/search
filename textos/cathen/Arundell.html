<h1>Arundell</h1>  

<h2>Thomas, First Lord Arundell of Wardour</h2>

<p>Born 1560; died at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, 7 November, 1639. He was the son of Sir Matthew Arundell of Wardour Castle, Wiltshire. The Arundells were a very old Norman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> settled in Cornwall and dating back to about the middle of the thirteenth century. Thomas, first Lord Arundell of Wardour, was grandson of a Sir John Arundell, of the Arundells of Lanherne, "the Great Arundells," a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> branch of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Sir John had become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (Dodd, Church History) through <a href="../cathen/08459a.htm">Father Cornelius</a>, a native of the neighbouring town of Bodmin. Owing to his defence of <a href="../cathen/08459a.htm">Cornelius</a>, Sir John Arundell was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for nine years in Ely Palace, Holborn. (Challoner, Memoirs of Missionary Priests, 1803.) Thomas, first Lord Aundell of Wardour, called "the Valiant," was strongly adverse to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> and refused to attend <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> services. Elizabeth committed him to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in 1580. When he was freed, he travelled, and entered the Austrian service under Archduke Matthias, brother of Emperor Rudolph II. He distinguished himself fighting against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottomans</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and at the siege of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, or Strigonium, 7 September, 1595, he was the first through the breach and, scaling the tower, plucked the Crescent thence and planted in its place the Imperial Standard. The Emperor created him and his posterity Counts of the Holy Roman Empire, 14 December, 1595. On his return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the peers decided that no privilege or precedence should be shown to his title. James I, recognizing Arundell's <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a> and loyalty, rewarded him by creating him a peer with the style and title of Baron Arundell of Wardour, 1605. Charles I at the beginning of his reign forbade the new peer to bear arms, because he was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, though Thomas had contributed liberally to avert the danger of the <a href="../cathen/01727c.htm">Spanish Armada</a>. Lord Arundell of Wardour died at the age of seventy-nine. His portrait, by <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Dyck</a>, 1635, is at Wardour.
<h2>Thomas, Second Lord Arundell of Wardour</h2>

<p>Succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> in 1639. In the trouble between Charles I and the parliament, the House of Commons ordered Arundell's arrest, November, 1641, but he evaded capture, and when the royal standard was unfurled at <a href="../cathen/11133a.htm">Nottingham</a>, 22 August, 1642, he raised a company of horse and fought for His Majesty's cause. He was wounded in battle, and died at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, 1643. His wife, the heroic Lady Blanche Arundell, was the sixth daughter of Edward, Earl of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, an admirable <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and a discreet and loyal subject. She is known by her spirited defence of Wardour Castle, Wiltshire, during the absence of her husband. With only twenty-five men at her command, she withstood thirteen hundred rebels, under Sir Edward Hungerford and Colonel Strode, for eight days. When <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to capitulate she did so on honourable terms, signed 8 May, 1643. She left the castle destitute, and was provided with lodging at <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> by Lord Hertford. She died at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, 28 October, 1649, and was buried with her husband at Tisbury.
<h2>Henry, Third Lord Arundell of Wardour</h2>

<p>B. 1606; d. 1694, was the sole male issue of Thomas, second Lord, and Lady Blanche Arundell. When he succeeded to the title, in 1643, his wife and sons were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, and Wardour Castle was in the hands of the Parliamentary forces under General Ludlow. To dislodge them, he sacrificed his castle by springing a mine under it. He was subsequently wounded in several battles, his estates were sequestrated, and he was forced to leave the country. When the monarchy was restored he recovered his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by an expenditure of &#163;35,000. In 1669 he was employed by Clifford in arranging the famous preliminaries of the secret treaty of Dover between <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and Charles II. But the king whom he had served so well almost suffered him to become a victim of the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> Titus Oates, on whose <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjured</a> statement Lord Arundell of Wardour was thrown into the Tower at the instance of the House of Commons, in October, 1678, with four other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peers. During his confinement he wrote some poems, which were published under the title of "Five Little Meditations in Verse" (London, 1679). After five years of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, during which time one of the peers, Stafford, had been beheaded, and another had died in the Tower, Arundell and his two remaining companions were released, and their indictments annulled, on the ground of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>. James II made Arundell Keeper of the Privy Seal, 1687. In 1688 he presented an address in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholics</a>, but he opposed the admission of Father Petre into the privy council. At the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution of 1688</a> he retired from public life. He was praised for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and for his kindness to poor <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
