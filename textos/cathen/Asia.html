<h1>Asia</h1>  

<p>In the present article it is intended to give a rapid survey of the geography, ethnography, political and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a> of Asia, and especially of the rise, progress, and actual condition of Asiatic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. For further information concerning the religious conditions of the various Asiatic countries, the reader is referred to the special articles on the subject in this Encyclopedia.

<p>Asia is the largest of the continents, having a geographic area of about 17,000,000 square miles, or about one-third of the whole of the dry land. It is also the oldest known portion of the globe, the earliest known seat of civilization, and, in all probability, the cradle of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, although scholars differ as to whether the primitive home of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> should be located in South-western Asia, and more particularly in the Tigris-Euphrates valley, as the Biblical tradition of Genesis seems to indicate, or rather in Central Asia, and more particularly in the Indo-Iranian plateau. On the north, Asia is bounded by the Arctic Ocean; on the east, by the Pacific Ocean; on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the West by <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the Black Sea, the Greek Archipelago, the Mediterranean, and the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>. It is united with Africa by the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> Isthmus of Suez, and with <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by the Caucasus Mountains and the long Ural range.

<p>The physical features of Asia, owing to its immense geographical area, are of great diversity. There we meet the most extensive lowlands, the most extensive table-lands, and at the same time with the highest chains of mountains, and the most elevated summits in the world. About two-thirds of its area is table-lands, and the other third mountainous regions, some of which are covered with perpetual snow. The lowland sections may be divided into six distinct regions, namely: (1) The Siberian lowland, which is by far the largest, and for the most part gloomy and barren; (2) the Bucharistan lowland, situated between the Caspian Sea and Lake Aral, a wide sterile waste; (3) the Syro-Arabian lowland, partly sterile and partly extremely productive and fertile; (4) the Hindustan lowland, of about 500,000 square miles, comprising the great valley of the Ganges, and very fertile; (5) the Indo-Chinese lowlands, including the regions of Cambodia and Siam; and (6) the Chinese lowland, extending from Peking as far as the Tropic of Cancer, with about 220,000 square miles, and extremely fertile. Asia is poor in lakes but very rich in rivers, the most famous of which are the Tigris and the Euphrates, the Indu with its many tributaries, the Brahmaputra, the Ganges, the Irrawaddy, the Sal-win, the Me-nam, the Me-kong, the Hong-kiang, the Yang-tze-kiang,, the Hwang-ho, or Yellow River, the Amur, and the many river-systems of <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>. On account of its vast extent and diversity of climate, the mineral, vegetable, and animal products of Asia are naturally varied, rich, and almost unlimited.

<p>Geographically, Asia may be divided into four great regions: (1) Northern Asia, or Asiatic <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, which includes Siberia, Caucasia, and the Aral-Caspian Basin, i.e., Russian Turkostan, the Turkoman country, Kiva, Bokhara, and the region of the upper Oxus; (2) Eastern Asia, comprising <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, Korea, and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>; (3) Southern Asia, comprising <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, <a href="../cathen/07765a.htm">Indo-China</a>, and Siam; (4) South-western Asia, comprising the famous historic lands of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a>, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, Palestine, and Arabia.

<p>Politically, Asia is divided as follows: (1) Russian Empire, including Siberia and as far west as the borders of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and Turkistan, and as far south as the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese Empire</a>; (2) <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese Empire</a>, including <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a>, and Tibet; (3) <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> Empire; (4) <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> proper, or British Empire; (5) Siam; (6) Indo-China under French dominion; (7) Afghanistan; (8) <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>; and (9) Asiatic Turkey, which comprises all Irak and Mesopotamia, Kurdistan, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Arabia. The entire population of Asia (according to the statistics of 1900) is estimated at about 800,000,000, or more than half the entire population of the earth, and divided as follows: Asiatic <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, 24,947,500; <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, 330,829,900; Korea, 9,670,000; <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, 46,494,000; Indo-China, 15,590,000; Siam, 6,320,000; <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, 302,831,700; Afghanistan, 4,550,000; <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, 9,000,000; Asiatic Turkey, including Arabia, 19,126,500.

<p>Ethnographically, the population of Asia may be reduced to three great groups, or races, viz: (1) the Mongolian, or Turania, to which belong all the inhabitants of the whole Northern Asia, and as far south as the plains bordering the Caspian Sea, including <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, the Indo-Malayan peninsula, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, Korea, and the Archipelago, making by far the largest part of the population of Asia. The Mongolian race is characterized by its yellow skin, black eyes and hair, flat nose, oblique eyes, short stature with little hair on the body and face. (2) The Aryan, or Indo-Iranian group, to which the great majority of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> peoples belong. It extends over the whole of Southern and part of Western Asia, embracing the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, the Iranians, the Medo-Persians, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, the Caucasians, and the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. (3) The <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a>, which extends over the whole of South-western Asia, and comprises the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, the Assyro-Babylonians or Mesopotamians, the Syrians, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the entire <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> population of Asiatic Turkey.



<p>The numerous languages spoken in Asia may be roughly classified as follows: (1) The Turanian branch, to which belong the Mongolian, the Manchu, the Chinese, the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, the old <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a>, and Tatar. (2) The Aryan or Indo-Iranian, to which belong most of the hundred and twenty languages and dialects of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, especially the old Sanskrit, the Iranian, or old Persian, which is the language of the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a>, and of the old Archem&aelig;nian inscriptions, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, the Georgian, and a considerable part of modern Persian. (3) The <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> group, to which belong the ancient languages of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> and Babylonians, the various, but mostly extinct, old Chanaanitish dialects, the Hebrew, the <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a>, the numerous eastern and western Aramaic dialects, known as Syriac, and represented nowadays by the modern Chaldean and neo-Syrian dialects used by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> of Kurdistan, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and Mesopotamia, and finally Arabic, which in various forms and dialects is spoken throughout Arabia and by the great majority of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> populations of Hindustan, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, Mesopotamia, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, as well as by most of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the two last-mentioned countries.
<h2>History of Asia</h2>

<p>At what period man first made his appearance in Asia we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, although there have been various and conflicting theories as to when that even took place. The general opinion now entertained by scholars is that somewhere from the fifth and seventh millennium B. C., Asia was chiefly peopled by two great races, viz., the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> and the Mongolian or Turanian. The former occupied the south-west portion of Asia, that is to say, the lands lying on the south-east corner of the Mediterranean and contiguous to the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> and the Persian Gulf, including <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, Palestine, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, and the extensive regions watered by the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris, afterwards composing the two mighty empires of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> and Assyria; the latter occupied the regions of Northern and Eastern Asia, stretching inward from the coast of the Pacific Ocean, and including <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and the districts to the west and south contiguous to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. At about the same period some of the Turanian tribes of Northern and Central Asia pressed their way to the west, invaded <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and pushed as far south-west as the Persian Gulf and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, where they soon overcame the native <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semites</a>, subjugating them to their rule and power, and forcing upon them their own Turanian religion and civilization. The existence and supremacy of this Turanian element in the southern part of the Tigris-Euphrates valley is historically attested by the old <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> inscriptions, by their system of writing, language, civilization, and governing dynasties. Scholars have given the name Turanians, or Akkadians, or better Sumerians, to this foreign invading element, and they are all agreed that their power and authority remained uncontested for about a thousand years, i.e., till about the beginning of the third millennium B. C., when the native <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> Babylonians, aided perhaps by numerous <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> immigrants from Arabia and <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, overthrew the Sumerian power, uniting North and South <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> into several <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> confederations, and, later on, into one united <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> Babylon.

<p>At the same time various <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> nationalities began to develop in <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, Mesopotamia, and <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>. Toward the second half of the first millennium B. C., Assyrian power made its first appearance, and successfully contested with <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> the supremacy over Western Asia. Toward 1200 B.C. the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelitish tribe</a> invaded and settled in <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>. In 605 B. C., Ninive, the capital of the Assyrian Empire, fell by the hands of Nabupalassar, of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, and Cyaxares, of Media; and with its fall the powerful Assyrian Empire came to an end. Less than a century later Babylon itself was captured by Cyrus (538 B. C.) and the whole of Western Asia passed under the Medo-Persian power of Cyrus, Cambyses, and Darius, till the time of the triumph of the Macedonian army under Alexander the Great (330 B. C.). After the Selucid&aelig;, Western Asia passed into the power of the Parthian, <a href="../cathen/01753f.htm">Arsacid</a>, and Sassanian dynasties of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and remained so until the advent and the seeping triumph of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> armies in the seventh century of the Christian era. While the Sassanian kings held their power and authority over the whole region east of the Euphrates, the Romans had absolute power over <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, parts of northern Mesopotamia, and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. Arabia, on the other hand, had successfully resisted permanent foreign encroachments, and the numerous tribes of that peninsula continued to be governed by their own sheikhs, princes, and kings. The Southern Arabia kingdoms, those of Yemen, Himyar, <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a>, and Ma'an, were in continuous struggle against one another and especially against the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a> of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>. Towards the middle of the seventh century of the Christian era, the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> armies, having united the numerous <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> tribes into one <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> Arabia, crossed into <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. In less than fifty years the whole of Western Asia was completely reduced by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> armies, and remained so until about the middle of the thirteenth or the opening of the fourteenth century, when Tatar and Mongolian armies of the terrible Ghengis Khan, Temur Lang, and their successors swept over all Western Asia, overthrowing the Abbasic dynasty in Irak, and that of the Seljuks in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. Soon after, Western Asia passed into the power of the Ottoman <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> who have succeeded in maintaining their authority intact over the same regions till our own day.

<p>The Mongolian tribes of Northern Asia seem to have grown as early as the second millennium B.C. into various kingdoms and nationalities, such as the Chinese, the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, the Tatars, with their distinct kingdoms and dynasties. The history and the development of these north and east Asiatic kingdoms are, comparatively speaking, of little importance for the international history of civilized Asia, inasmuch as their power and influence did not materially or permanently affect the development and the destinies of the near East. Even the Tatar and Turcoman hordes, who for the last six centuries have held under their sway the destinies of Western Asia, soon adopted the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> religion and civilization.

<p>Unlike their <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> brethren, the Aryan tribes of Southern Asia and Iran did not play a very important part in the pages of history. With the exception of the conquest of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> by the Iranian conqueror Cyrus and the supremacy of Sassanian dynasties over the east half of Western Asia the Indo-Iranian tribes of South and west-Central Asia developed no particularly remarkable kingdoms or power. The earliest event of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> historical <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> does not date farther back than 1400 B. C., and possibly later. It is the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of Mahabharat, the story of which is contained in a poem written about 500 B. C., that forms a part of the epic literature of ancient <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The accounts of antecedent periods are manifestly mythical, and merely indicate the probability of the gradual process of conquering Brahmanic races from west to east. From that time down to the beginning of the nineteenth century, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> was governed by various native and Mogul dynasties; and toward the beginning of the last century it passed into the power of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
<h2>Religions of Asia</h2>

<p>The principal <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of Asia are: <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahmanism</a>, <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/14446b.htm">Taoism</a>, <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zorastrianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.

<ul> <li>Brahmanism is the oldest known and prevailing religious system of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, counting 210,000,000 <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> adherents. <li>Buddhism (from <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddha</a>, the "wise", the "enlightened"), owes its origin to Gautama, otherwise called Sakya Muni (i.e. the Sakya sage), who flourished toward the middle of the sixth century B.C. It is by far the widest-spread religion in Asia, counting more than 400,000,000 adherents, 300,000,000 of whom are in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, where it is the chief of the three recognized <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. Its other followers are found in <a href="../cathen/13767b.htm">Siberia</a>, Korea, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (Ceylon and Burma). <li>Reformed <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> is a recent development in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, and it plainly shows the influence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <li>Confucianism is one of the three chief <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, the other two being <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> and Taoism. <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucianism</a> is a system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> rather than religion. It is the official religion of the State, and the basis of the social and political life of the Chinese nation. <li>Taoism is the third recognized religion of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. It takes its name from that of its founder, Lauo-tsze, or L&acirc;o-tse, which lived in the sixth century before the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>. Taoism as a religious system has degenerated from its high original <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> into a system of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> observances, and so forms the accepted religion of the lowest and most <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> class of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a>, counting about 100,000,000 adherents. It also has many followers in Cochin-China and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. <li>Zoroastrianism is the religion of the ancient Iranians and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>. Its founder was Zoroaster, the great <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of Iran, who flourished toward the sixth century B.C. Once a very powerful religion, <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrianism</a> has almost vanished before <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a>, counting nowadays only a few thousand followers in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. </ul>
<h3>Mohammedism in Asia</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a>, is one of the three great <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, the other two being <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. No accurate statistics have as yet been taken of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> population of the world. The latest approved estimate, however, places the number at a little over two hundred millions. Of these, sixty million are in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and most of the rest in Asia as follows: 18,000,000 in Asiatic Turkey; 30,000,000 in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; 60,000,000 in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and Burmah; 31,000,000 in the Malay Archipelago; and the rest in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, Afghanistan, Caucasia, and Russian Turkistan. In the Mindanao kingdom and in the Sulu group of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a> there are about 360,000 and 250,000 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, respectively. The relations of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> to <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> are discussed in the article <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">M<font size=-2>OHAMMEDANISM</font></a>, and in the articles on the various <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a>.

<h3>Judaism in Asia</h3>

<p>Towards the twelfth century before the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>, we find the Hebrews permanently settled in Palestine. The earliest known Hebrew migrations from Palestine occurred during the reign of Sargon, King of Assyria (722-705 B. C.), who having in 722 captured Sumeria, the capital of the northern <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelitish</a> kingdom, transported 27,000 <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> Hebrews to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and the frontiers of <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a>. A century and a half later, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, King of Babylon (605-562 B. C.) carried off from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> some twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Soon after his capture of Babylon, Cyrus allowed the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to return to Palestine. The poorest class returned, but the most prosperous <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> remained in the land of their exile, where they soon rose to great social and financial prosperity. Towards 350 B.C. Artaxerxes Ochus deported to Hyrcania a group of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that had revolted. Upon the triumph of the Macedonian army, and under the successors of Alexander the Great, great numbers of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> migrated into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. After the overthrow of the last Jewish kingdom, and following the fall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the destruction of the temple at the hands of the Romans, <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> at large passed beyond the limits of its ancient centres, and began to spread over <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, North Africa, and Western Asia. During the first five centuries of the Christian era, we find numerous Jewish colonies scattered all over <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a>, and as far as South Arabia. In the last-mentioned country they obtained political supremacy for a while, under the Himyarire King Dh&uacute;-Nuw&acute;s. In Southern <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, especially during the Sassanian dynasty of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, they acquired great ascendancy, with very flourishing religious and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> centres, such as the famous academies of <a href="../cathen/14343a.htm">Sura</a>, Nehardea, Pumbadita, and Mahuza, whence sprang the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud.

<p>With the advent of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, however, and the rapid conquest of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> armies, <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> suffered greatly in <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, and in all the newly conquered provinces. Its followers were almost always harshly and severely dealt with by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>, although under the reign of several Abbasid caliphs they were kindly treated. The Byzantine emperors, on the one hand, were anything but friendly to them; and its noteworthy that, although in the first three centuries of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were the first to become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a>, nevertheless the two <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> developed afterwards the most lamentable antagonism which lasted for a great many centuries. Notwithstanding the many persecutions to which they had to submit, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have persevered their racial and religious unity in various countries in Asia, where they are divided as follows: 65,000 in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>; 90,000 in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine; 70,000 in Mesopotamia and Irak; 60,000 in Arabia; 58,000 in the Caucasus; 35,000 in Siberia; 8,000 in Ferghana; 9,000 in Bokhara; 2,000 in Khiva; 3,000 in Aden; 15,000 in British <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>; 2,000 in Afghanistan; 25,000 in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>; 1,000 in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and 500 in various other countries, making a total of about 450,000, or less than half a million.
<h3>Christianity in Asia</h3>

<p>Asia is the cradle and the primitive home of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; for it was in its extreme south-western borders, i.e., in Palestine, the home of the Chosen People, that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Founder of Christianity</a> chose to appear, to live, and to preach the New Dispensation. Soon after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus'</a> death, his Apostles and Disciples actively began the evangelization of the world, and tradition tells us that the Apostles went to different localities; some to Palestine, others to <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, some to Greece and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, others to Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, and even as far as <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. Palestine and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, however, were naturally the first recipients of the new religion, and here, the Jewish communities furnished the first nucleus of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a>. From <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> propaganda spread into <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and through the effective preaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, it penetrated into the principal cities of the Mediterranean coast and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, crossing the borders of Asia and reaching into the very heart of the Roman Empire. From the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> it can be conclusively shown that as early as the second half of the first century of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities existed in the following Asiatic cities: <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Acts, passim), Damascus (<a href="../bible/act009.htm">Acts 9</a>), <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> villages (<a href="../bible/act008.htm">Acts 8</a>), Lydda (ix), <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a> (ib.), C&aelig;sarea in Palestine (<a href="../bible/act010.htm">Acts 10</a>), Antioch in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> (xi), <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> (xxi), Sidon (xxvii), Tarsus (ix, xi, xv), Salamina in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> (xiii), Perge in Pamphilia (xiii, xiv), Iconium (xiii, xiv), Lystra (xiv), Derbe (xiv), several unnamed localities in Galacia (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm">Galatians 1</a>, <a href="../bible/1pe001.htm">1 Peter 1</a>), in Cappadocia (<a href="../bible/1pe001.htm">1 Peter 1</a>), Ephesus (<a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a> and Paul's Epistles), Laodicea (Paul's Epp.), Hierapolis in Phygia (Paul's Epp.), Smyrna (Apoc.), Sardis (ib.), Philadelphia in Lydia (ib.), Thyatira in Lydia (ib.), and very probably also in Ashdod in Philistia, <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, Attalia in Pamphilia, Amphipolis, Apolonia, Assus, <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, and other islands of the Mediterranean. From <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> the activity of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries spread north, south, east, and west through <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a>, <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>,, and the West. As regards Asia, we have historical evidence that towards the middle of the second century, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities were established also in <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, various cities of Mesopotamia, along the Tigris and the Euphrates, <a href="../cathen/10166a.htm">Melitene</a>, <a href="../cathen/09533a.htm">Magnesia</a>, Tralles in Caria, Philomelium in <a href="../cathen/12116b.htm">Pisidia</a>, Parium in Mysia, <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, Otris, <a href="../cathen/07322a.htm">Hierapolis</a>, Pepuza, Tymion, Ardaban, <a href="../cathen/01592b.htm">Apamea</a>, Cumane, and Eumanea in Phrygia, Ancyra in Galatia, <a href="../cathen/14014b.htm">Sinope</a>, Amastris in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, Debeltum in Thrace, Larissa in Thessalia, Myra in Lycia, etc. (See Harnack, Expansion of Christianity in the First Three Centuries, II, 240, sqq.). From the signatures of the various Asiatic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who assisted at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicea</a> (325) we have conclusive evidence that towards the year 300, and in fact considerably earlier, there existed in the following Asiatic provinces and cities not only <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities, but also well organized churches, diocese, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> centres: <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, C&aelig;sarea, Samaria-Sebaste, Lydda-Diospolis, <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Joppe</a>, Saron, Emmaus-Nicopolis, Sichem-Neapolis, <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a>, Jamnia, Azotus, <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, <a href="../cathen/06332a.htm">Gadara</a>, <a href="../cathen/03309b.htm">Capitolias</a>, <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, Anea, Anim and Jattir, Bethabara, Sycar-Asker, Batanea, Pheno, and many other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, etc. In the last three mentioned regions, in fact, we have positive traces of fully organized <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and churches as early as the first half of the third century, with many illustrious <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.

<p>In the fourth, fifth, and sixth, and the beginning of the seventh century, until the rise of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> became the dominant and generally accepted religion of Western Asia, with the exception of Arabia. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, however, was subject politically to two mighty rival powers, the Roman and the Persian. To the first of these, the whole of Palestine, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, North-west Arabia, west-Euphratean Mesopotamia, and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> were subject; while to the latter belonged east-Euphratean Mesopotamia, North-east Arabia, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, Babylon, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and Media. The endless rivalries and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of these two powers <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> indeed fatal to the progress of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and to the permanent unity of the two great <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Churches</a>, the Roman and the Persian. These obstacles notwithstanding, the <a href="../cathen/14413a.htm">Christian Church of Persia</a>, from its very beginning down to the middle of the fifth century, was dependent on the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and consequently in communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, although it had its own <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, the great <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the fifth centuries broke this union asunder. <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, unable to gain any permanent footing in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and the West, found a strong ally and defender in the Sassanian kings of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and in the Mesopotamia Church, which, towards the end of the fifth century, had already completely estranged itself from Antioch and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and had become an independent national church, having as its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> head the great <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of the East, i.e., of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. In the meanwhile, <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> began to rage in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, and Mesopotamia alike, forming thus another independent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Church. Soon after, the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> churches of Western Asia prospered and developed to such an extent as to complete in greatness and influence with most <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian churches</a>, the Roman excepted.

<p>With the advent is <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, however, and the rapid conquest of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> armies (seventh century), <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> suffered most severely. Soon after the death of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, all these provinces fell, one after the other, into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>, who threatened, for a while, the entire extinction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Western Asia. Thanks however, to the tolerant attitude of the majority of the Umayyad, and the Abbasid caliphs of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> and Bagdad respectively, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> empire rose gradually to a new and unprecedented life and vigour, and in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> churches, but especially the first, reached their highest degree of prosperity. <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and Jacobite <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and men of letters soon became the teachers of the conquering <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, and the pioneers of Islamo-Arabic <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, civilization, and learning. <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> physicians became the attending physicians of the court, and the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> patriarch and his numerous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were regarded in Asia as second to none in power and authority. From Western Asia, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> spread into <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, Socotra, and the Malabar Coast, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a> and Tatary, where it soon became extremely influential and possessed numerous churches and well-organized <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. So that as early as the ninth and tenth centuries, the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> extended over Central, Southern, west-Central and South-western Asia, as far as <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and had more than two hundred subordinate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>. In the meanwhile, the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> church held sway in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, north Mesopotamia, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, where it developed strength, if not equal, certainly not very inferior, to that of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>.

<p>In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Tatar invasions and devastations in Central and Western Asia put an end to Arabic domination, dealing, at the same time, a deadly blow to both the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and the Jacobite Churches, and causing havoc and consternation among Asiatic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in general. Hundreds and thousands of these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were massacred, their churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> ruined, and a great number of the wavering compelled to renounce their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and embrace <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>. The weakened condition of both the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and Jacobite Churches paved the way to their return to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and many of their <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, thanks to the incessant and salutary work of early <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries, asked to be once more united with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as of old. The stream of conversions became more pronounced and rapid during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and has continued so till our own day. <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions were established all over Asia with the result that a large number of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> have long since renounced their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> creeds and embraced <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The same gratifying movement took place in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, as well as in the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>.
<h3>Actual condition of the Christian Church</h3>

<p>The history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in Asia is intimately connected with the rise and progress of the Asiatic missions. The merit of first having disclosed to the West, and to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in particular, the mysterious and impenetrable East as well as the conditions of <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Christianity</a> undoubtedly belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. Profiting by this information, and ever solicitous of the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were the first to seize the opportunity for a propaganda in the Far, as well as in the near East. Towards the end of the fourteenth century, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, and Honorius II, sent the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries, Lorenzo of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, Giovanni Piano de Carpine, <a href="../cathen/13217a.htm">Wilhelm Ruysbrock (de Rubuquis)</a>, Giovanni of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, and others, as their representative delegates to the great Mogul, Kublai Khan, on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Christians</a>. In 1306, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Giovanni di Montecorvino, was sent by <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> on a similar mission to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, where he was subsequently appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with seven <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a> by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, and where he died in 1330. In 1318, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Francesco di Peruga was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sultania, in Tatary, by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a>, and in 1321-28, another <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missionary, Giodano Catalini, accompanied by three <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, made two successful journeys to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, to the coast of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, the Ceylon, and to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. In 1323 the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Odorico di Pordenone, visited Ceylon, Java, Borneo, Kahn-Balikh, <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, returning in 1331, after having <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> more than 20,000 <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> who were appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as the official guardians of the sanctuaries of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and of the Holy Land, began to extend their missionary activity to North <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, North-west Mesopotamia, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> advanced into Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. In 1501, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Enrico of Coimbra, accompanied the Portuguese, <a href="../cathen/03128a.htm">Alvarez Cabral</a>, into Calicut, <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>, <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, and Cranganore; and in 1521 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries first penetrated into the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>. During the years 1541-45, <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> evangelized <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, the coasts of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a> and Travancore, and Ceylon; in 1545, Malacca; in 1546 the Moluccas; from 1549-51, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, and in 1551, on his way to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, he died, after an apostolic career not less wonderful and unique than successful and rich in results.

<p>With the mission of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and the founding of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, there began a new era for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionary enterprise, an era of indomitable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and exceptional success. <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> were now eagerly vying with one another for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianization</a> of Asia. Naturally enough, the numerous <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, Jacobite, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and Greek <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> communities and churches scattered through the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> dominion in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, and through <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> attracted their attention; and thanks to their noble missionary effort and their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, great numbers of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> Orientals with their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> joined the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and churches, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> were established among all these <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> in Asiatic Turkey and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, as well as among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, Korea, <a href="../cathen/13765a.htm">Siam</a>, Cochin-China, and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> of Western Asia (Turkey and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>), however, are for us of particular interest, as they represent old and venerable national Churches, having their own <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, rites, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> languages and usages, and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, which had, as early as the fifth century, separated themselves from the church of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They represent what we usually call the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">oriental churches</a>, and are divided as follows: (1) The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> church, extended over <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> and Chaldea, Mesopotamia and Assyria, Kurdistan, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and the coast of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. (2) The Jacobite Church (<a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>) which extends over <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, North-west Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, and Malabar. (3) The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church (<a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>) which extends over the whole of <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and part of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. (4) The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> church, which is a branch of the Syrian Church, and extends over Mount Lebanon and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. (5) The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, scattered over <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. Another church, generally referred to as an Oriental church, is the Coptic, or <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a>, which, being restricted to African soil, must be here omitted. It must be noted, however, that each of the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> excepted, which is entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, is divided into two independent branches, or Churches; the one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and in communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the other <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> and separated from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; each, however, having its own patriarch, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and local churches.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> branch of each of these <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a>, although united with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, preserves, in common with its sister <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> branch, its own primitive, original rite, liturgy, and its own <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and privileges, the maintenance of which has been scrupulously prescribed and insisted upon by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a>, under penalty of suspension and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; no <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> or lay member being allowed to change his rite without a special <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>All of the above statistics are only approximately correct, as the various censuses so far as published are often <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, contradictory, and misleading. According to P. Pisani (Vacant, Dictionnaire de th&eacute;ologie catholique, I, coll. 2096-2097), the entire population, according to their various <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> and creeds, may be approximately classified as follows:

<ul> <li>I.&mdash;Buddhists, 400,000,000; Brahmins, 200,000,000; <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, 100,000,000; other <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, 80,000,000; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, 20,000,000; total 800,000,000. <li>II.&mdash;Protestants: In Western Asia, 85,000; <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, 817,000; <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and Korea, 210,000; <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, 50,000; total, 1,162,000. <li>III.&mdash;Catholics: Asiatic <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, 70,000 to 75,000; Asiatic Turkey and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, 700,000; <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, 2,140,000; <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, Korea, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, and Indo-China, 1,710,000; <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, 6,000,000; total, 10,625,000. </ul>
