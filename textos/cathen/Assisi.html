<h1>Assisi</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> located in the civil province of Umbria, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The town of Assisi (<em>Assisium</em>), which takes its name from Mount Asi, on which it is situated, lies almost in the centre of the province of Umbria, about halfway between the cities of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a>, and forty-one miles north of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The beginnings of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisian</a> history are involved in much obscurity; but in early imperial times it had become a flourishing municipality of no mean importance, and lays claim, with some show of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to being the birthplace of the Latin poet Sextus Aurelius Propertius. The Gospel was first preached to the Assisians about the middle of the third century by St. Cyspolitus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bettona (ancient Vettona), who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> under the Emperor Maximilian. About 235 <a href="../cathen/13221b.htm">Sts. Rufinus</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Assisi by Pope St. Fabian; suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> about 236; and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/15414a.htm">St. Victorinus</a>. Both <a href="../cathen/15414a.htm">St. Victorinus</a> and his immediate successor, St. Sabinus, died <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the latter being most cruelly beaten to death. Of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who occupied the See of Assisi during the fifth and sixth centuries, one, Aventius, is worthy of mention. It was this heroic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who interceded (545) with Totila in behalf of the Assisians, and saved the city from the ravages of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogothic</a> army on its way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In succeeding centuries mention is made of several Bishops of Assisi who were present at <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Thus, in 659, Aquilinus was summoned by <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Pope Martin I</a> to be present at the Lateran Council, convened for the purpose of formulating decrees against the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>. In the seventh and eighth centuries Assisi fell under the power of the Lombard dukes, and in 773 was razed to the ground by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> for its determined resistance to him. He restored it, however, and at the same time all traces of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and Lombard sympathies disappeared. About the same time the great castle, or Rocca d'Assisi, was built, which stronghold made the town thenceforth a great power in the political life of central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Bishop Hugo, whose episcopate lasted from 1036 to 1050, transferred the episcopal chair to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of San Rufino, which he himself raised over the little oratory beneath which the Saint's bones had rested for eight centuries. From <a href="../cathen/13221b.htm">Sts. Rufinus</a> to the present incumbent of the See of Assisi, the Right Reverend Monsignor Ambrose Luddi, O. P., the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of that see have numbered some ninety-two; but of these some are little known, and the existence of others is more or less problematical. Assisi is chiefly famous as the birthplace of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>. All the places sanctified by his presence have been preserved in their original state or transformed into sanctuaries. Foremost among these is the basilica of Our Lady of Angels, erected on the model of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> through the beneficence of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope St. Pius V</a>, which shelters the famous little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <em>Porziuncula</em> (<em>Portiuncula</em>), the cradle of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, where <a href="../cathen/06208a.htm">St. Francis</a> received the great <em>Perdono d'Assisi</em>, more commonly known as the <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Portiuncula Indulgence</a>. Within this basilica also stands the tiny cell in which <a href="../cathen/06208a.htm">St. Francis</a> died, and which contains among other things the well-known <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> by <a href="../cathen/13095b.htm">Luca della Robbia</a> made after the Saint's death mask. St. Francis's remains now repose in the patriarchal basilica of San Francesco, erected through the exertions of Brother Elias, the first stone of which was laid by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, 25 July, 1228. Consecrated by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, this church is composed of three sanctuaries, one over the other, and is one of the earliest specimens of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. "There is nothing like it", says Taine. "Before seeing it one has no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the art and genius of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>." It is difficult to overestimate the stimulus given to Italian art by the building of this great double basilica, in the decoration of which the foremost <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of the day were engaged, including <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>, whose famous mystical frescoes, illustrative of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience, adorn the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">lower church</a>. The recent revival of widespread interest in all that concerns <a href="../cathen/06208a.htm">St. Francis</a> has made Assisi the goal of a new race of literary and artistic <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The splendours and associations of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of San Francesco and Santa Maria degli Angeli tend to overshadow the other churches of Assisi. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of San Rufino, mentioned above, which dates from 1140, is noted for its beautiful fa&#231;ade and possesses a font (the only one in Assisi) in which not only <a href="../cathen/06208a.htm">St. Francis</a> and <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The Chiesa Nuova, a Greek cross, surmounted by five <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupolas</a> and standing on the site of St. Francis's <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> house, was built at the expense of Phillip III of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1615. Santa Chiara, a splendid <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of the thirteenth century, due to the genius of Filippo di Campello, contains the remains of St. Clare, the co-foundress with <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> of the Poor Ladies, or <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, as they are now called, and daughter of Count Favorino Scifi, an Assisian noble. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Damian's in which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> lived, stands without the city and is little changed since her day. Aside from the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, perhaps the most interesting monuments in Assisi are the remains of the temple of Minerva, a striking reminder of the Roman period, and the renowned castle known as the Rocca Magiore, dating, as it seems from <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> time, and affording a magnificent panorama of Assisi and its vicinity. The population of the town now numbers 3,750.
<h2>Present status</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Assisi now comprises four municipalities in the civil province of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> (Umbria), besides twenty-six small hamlets and villages, each, with the exception of Porziano, having its church and resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. There are 3 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for boys, with 206 pupils; and one episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, with 28 seminarists. There are 64 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and 125 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; while the faithful of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> number 28,500. There are 8 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of men and 18 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The churches <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> in the diocese number 190, with 35 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in all. The Diocese of Assisi is <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, a privilege which it has enjoyed from remote antiquity.
