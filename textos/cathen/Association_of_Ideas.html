<h1>Association of Ideas</h1>  

<p>(1) A principle in <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> to account for the succession of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> states;

<p>(2) the basis of a philosophy known as Associationism.

<p>The fact of the association of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> was noted by some of the earliest <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (De mem. et rem., 2) indicates the three <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of association which have been the basis of nearly all later enumerations. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, in his commentary on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, accepts and illustrates them at some length. Hamilton (Notes on Reid) gives considerable credit to the Spanish Humanist, Vives (1492-1540), for his treatment of the subject. Association of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> is not, therefore, a discovery of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, as has often been asserted.

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, however, that the principle of association of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> received in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> an interpretation never given to it before. The name is derived from Locke who placed it at the head of one of the chapters of his "Essay", but used it only to explain peculiarities of character. Applied to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> states in general, the name is too restricted, since <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, in the English sense, are only cognitive processes. The association theory held by Hobbes, Berkeley, Hume, and Hamilton, but it received its widest interpretation at the hands of the Associationists, Hartley, Priestley, James Mill, John Stuart Mill, Bain, and Spencer. They regarded it as a principle capable of explaining all <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> phenomena. For them it is in the subjective world what the principle of gravitation is in the physical World. Association of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, though variously explained, is accepted by all modern <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychologists</a>. Sully, Maudsley, James, Hoffding, Munsterberg, Ebbinghaus, Ziehen, Taine, Ribot, Luys, and many others accept it more or less in the spirit of the Associationists.

<p>The traditional <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of association, based on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, are: <ol><li>Similarity <li>Contrast <li>Contiguity in time or space. </ol> In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, efforts were made to reduce them to more fundamental <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Contrast has been resolved into similarity and contiguity. Contrasts, to recall each other, suppose generic similarity, as white recalls black. Yet this alone will not suffice, since this gives us no reason for the fact that white recalls black in preferenee to green or blue; hence experience, based on the fact that nature works in contrasts, is called into aid. Spencer, Hoffding, and others try to reduce all the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of association to that of similarity, while Wundt and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> believe that all can be reduced to experience and hence to contiguity. Bain, who has analyzed the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of association most thoroughly, holds both similarity and contiguity to be elementary principles. To these he adds certain <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of compound association. Oriental states easily recall one another when they have several points of contact. And in fact, considering the complexity of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> life, it would seem probable that simple associations, by similarity or contiguity alone, never occur. Besides these primary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of association, various secondary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are enumerated, such as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of frequency, vividness, recentness, emotional congruity, etc. These determine the firmness of the association, and consequently the preference given to one state over another, in the recall. Association of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> is a fact of everyday experience which furnishes an important basis for the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, yet it must be remembered that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of association offer no ultimate explanation of the facts observed. In accounting for the facts of association we must, in the first place, reject as insufficient the purely physical theory proposed by Ribot, Richet, Maudsley, Carpenter, and others, who seek an explanation exclusively in the association of brain processes. <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">Psychology</a> thus becomes a chapter of physiology and mechanics. Aside from the fact that this theory can give no satisfactory explanation of association by similarity which implies a distinctly <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> factor, it neglects evident facts of consciousness. Consciousness tells us that in reminiscence we can <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> direct the sequence of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> states, and it is in this that <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> recall differs from the succession of images and feelings in dream and delirium. Besides, one brain-process may excite another, but this is not yet a state of consciousness.

<p>Equally unsatisfactory is the theory of the ultra-spiritualists, who would have us believe that association of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> has nothing to do with the bodily organism, but is wholly <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a>. Thus Hamilton says that all physiological theories are too contemptible for serious criticism. Reid and Bowne reject all traces of perception left in the brain substance. Lotze admits a concomitant oscillation of the brain elements, but considers them quite secondary and as exercising no influence on memory and recall. Like the purely physical theory, this also fails to explain the facts of consciousness and experience. The localization of activities in the various brain-centres, the facts of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">mental disease</a> in consequence of injury lo the brain, the dependence of memory on the healthy condition of the central organ, etc. have in this theory no rational meaning. We must, then, seek an explanation in a theory that does <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to both the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> and the physical side of the phenomena. A mere psychophysical parallelism, proposed by some, will not, however, suffice, as it offers no explanation, but is a mere restatement of the problem. The <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, that the subject of sensory activity is neither the body alone nor the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, but the unitary being compounded of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, alone, but the best solution. As sense perception is not purely physiological nor purely <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a>, but proceeds from a faculty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> intrinsically united to an organ, so the association of these perception proceeds from a principle which is at the same time <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> and physical. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> purely spiritual <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> also associate; but, as <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> teaches, the most spiritual <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is not devoid of its physiological basis, and even in making use of the spiritual <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which it has already acquired, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> has need of images stored in the brain. It requires these organic processes in the production of its abstract <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. In its basis, the association of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> is physiological, but it is more than this, as it does not follow the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of matter. The higher faculties of the mind can command and direct the process. The <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> theory does <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the fact of the dependence of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> activities upon the organism, and yet leaves room for the freedom of the will attested by consciousness and experience.

<p>English Associationism, while claiming to be neither idealistic nor materialistic, and disavowing <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, has erected the principle of association of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> into a metaphysical principle to explain all <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> activity. James Mill enunciated the principle of indissoluble associations: Sensations or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> occuring together frequently, and never apart, suggest one another with irresistable force, so that we combine them necessarily. This principle is employed to explain <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> judgments and metaphysical concepts. Bain applied the principles of association to <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and ethics. Spencer interpreted them in an evolutionistic sense. Certain <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and moral principles are such that the associations of the individual are not sufficient to explain them; they are the associations of successive generations handed down by heredity. The whole process is governed by <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Mental states associate passively, and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> life is but a process of "mental chemistry". Later Associationists, like Sully, have come to recognize that the mind exerts activity in attention, discrimination, judgment, reasoning. With this admission there should <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> come also the admission of a soul-substance that attends, discriminates, judges, and reasons; but as they have not come to this conclusion, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is for them a "train of thoughts", a "stream of consciousness", or some other series veiled in metaphorical language. Association of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> can never explain <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> judgments, conclusions drawn from premises, moral <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; these have their causes deeper in the nature of things.
