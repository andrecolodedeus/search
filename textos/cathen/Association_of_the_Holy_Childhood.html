<h1>Association of the Holy Childhood</h1>  

<p>A children's association for the benefit of foreign missions. Twenty years after the foundation of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith (1843) Charles de Forbin-Janson, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, established the Society of the Holy Childhood (Association de la Sainte Enfance). Its end is twofold: First, to rally around the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> our little <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> children from their tender years, so that with increasing age and strength, and in imitation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> their Master, they may practise <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">Christian charity</a> with a view to their own perfection; second, that by the practice of charity and enduring liberality those same little <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> children may co-operate in saving from death and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the many thousands of children that in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> countries like <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> are neglected by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and cast away to die unbaptized. The further object of the association is to procure <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for those abandoned little ones, and, should they live, to make of them craftsmen, teachers, <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who in turn will spread the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> amongst their countrymen.

<p>Children may become members of the association immediately after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and may continue in membership for the remainder of their lives, but at the age of twenty-one, in order to still share in the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to become also a member of the Lyons Association for the Propogation of the Faith.

<p>In order to be a member of the Association of the Holy Childhood, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give a monthly contribution of one cent, or a yearly contribution of twelve cents, and to recite daily a "Hail Mary" with the addition, "Holy Virgin Mary, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us and for the poor <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> children." Until children are able to do this themselves their relatives should do it for them.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the regular director of the work from the time he introduces the association, and when there are at least twelve associates, he has a share in the privileges granted to the directors by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, provided that for the exercise of these privileges the requisite permission of the ordinary has been granted in general or has been specially asked for. The same holds good for the <a href="../cathen/12407a.htm">assistant priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> has entrusted to one of them the care of matters relating to the association.

<p>Four <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and hundreds of other ecclesiastical dignitaries have approved the association and recommended it to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 18 July, 1856, raised it to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>, gave it a <a href="../cathen/03341a.htm">cardinal protector</a>, and requested all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to introduce it in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, in an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> letter, <a href="../library/docs_le13sd.htm">Sancta Dei Civitas</a> (3 December, 1890), blessed it and recommended it again to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. "It is my earnest wish," he said in 1882, "that all the children of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world should become members of this beautiful association." <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> emphasized its international character, comparing it to a great army the component parts of which are the various national branches.

<p>The affairs of the association are managed by an international council at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, consisting of fifteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and as many <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. The general director of the association is the presiding officer. This general council has exclusively the right of general direction and of the distribution of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society's</a> funds. To them various national branches send in their yearly report with the contributions received. it is to be noted that none of the officers receive any compensation for their services. It is estimated that at the present time there are enrolled in the Association of the Holy Childhood about seven millions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children. Fully thirty-two millions of dollars are the result of their generosity, and about eighteen millions of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> children have thus been saved to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The receipts for 1907-08 were over $700,000. From this fund 236 missions in the various <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> countries were supported. An annual grant is made by the general council in favour of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Schools in the Western states and territories. 1,171 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 7,372 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and 2,480 workshops, etc., share in the yearly <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> received from all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries. The "Annals of the Holy Childhood", published bi-monthly, is issued in seven languages. Six countries contributed 90 percent, of last year's fund of $700,000, viz: <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, $278,355; <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> $169,540; <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, $30,995. Sun total from these six countries, $655,690. <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland's</a> contribution for 1907 amounted to $5,440 and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England's</a> to $1,595, these two English-speaking countries being represented in the total amount of 1 percent.

<p>The association was probably established in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> by Bishop Forbin-Janson himself. Several agencies in the East and West managed its affairs for about fifty years. On 1 January, 1893, the work was concentrated into one central agency and confided to the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a>, with headquarters in <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburgh</a>, Pa. Very Rev. A Zielenbach, C.S.Sp., was its first central director for about four years. Since then Rev. John William, C.S.Sp. is general manager, assisted by thirty-two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> directors who volunteer their services for this noble cause without any compensation. The total receipts in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> from 1893 to 31 October, 1908, were $319,012.76. About 18,000 copies of the "Annals" in English, German, Polish, and French are sent from the central office to the different local branches six times each year.
