<h1>Asterius</h1>  

<p>Name of several prominent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> history.

<p>(1) Asterius of <a href="../cathen/11777b.htm">Petra</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Arabia, ill-treated by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> faction at the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (343) for withdrawing from them his support, and exiled to Upper Libya in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, whence he was recalled in 362 by the edict of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> that restored all the banished <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He took part in the <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Council of Alexandria</a> (362), called, among other reasons, for the purpose of healing the Meletian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> that was rendering the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>. He was one bearers of the letter addressed by the council to the stubborn <a href="../cathen/09410b.htm">Lucifer of Cagliari</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> then at Antioch. These peaceful measures were, however, rendered useless by Lucifer's precipitancy in consecrating Paulinus as successor to <a href="../cathen/10161b.htm">Meletius of Antioch</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> gained a new lease of life.

<p>(2) Asterius of Amasea in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> (c. 400). The only fact in his life that is known is related by himself, viz. his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> by a Scythian or Goth who had been sent in his youth to a schoolmaster of Antioch and thus acquired an excellent <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and great fame among both Greeks and Romans. The extant writings of Asterius are twenty-one <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, scriptural and panegyrical in content. The two on penance and "on the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts'</a>' were formerly is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> (Bardenhewer, Patrologie, 1901, 267). A life of his predecessor, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, is ascribed to Asterius (Acta SS. 26 April). His works (P.G. XL) are described by <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a> (Mem., X, 409). He was a student of Demosthenes and an orator of repute. Lightfoot says (Dict. of Christ. Biogr., I, 178) that his best sermons display "no inconsiderable skill in rhetoric great power of expression, and great earnestness of moral conviction; some passages are even strikingly eloquent." The <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of Asterius, like those of <a href="../cathen/15754d.htm">Zeno of Verona</a>, offer no little valuable material to the <a href="../cathen/03705a.htm">Christian archaeologist</a>. [<a href="../cathen/11742b.htm">De Buck</a> in Acta SS. 30 Oct. (Paris, 1883), XIII, 330-334.]

<p>(3) Asterius of Cappadocia, a Greek <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">sophist</a>, a friend of Arius, and also his fellow student in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/09409a.htm">Lucian of Antioch</a>. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> quotes more than once from a pro-Arian work of this writer. He wrote commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans, the Gospels, the Psalms, and "many other works' (Jerome, De Vir. Ill., c. xciv), all of which have perished (Zahn, Marcellus von Ancyra, Gotha, 1867, 68 sqq.)

<p>(4) Asterius, a Roman senator mentioned by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.16</a>) as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> distinguished for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and charity. Rufinus says that he suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at Caesarea in Palestine in 262 (<a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, An. Eccl. <em>ad</em> an. 262, <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. 81, 82).

<p>(5) Asterius Urbanus, a <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a> writer of the latter part of the second century, referred to in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.16-17</a>); his work was probably a compilation of the pseudo-prophetic utterances of Montanus and his <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> companions Priscilla and Maximilla.
