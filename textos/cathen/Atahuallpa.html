<h1>Atahuallpa</h1>  

<p>Properly ATAU-HUALLPA (etymology usually given as from <em>huallpa</em>, the name of some indigenous bird).

<p>Son of the Inca <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> chief Huayna Capac and an Indian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> hence (descent being in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> line) not an Inca, but and Indian of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>. The protracted <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, during which the Incas overpowered the Ecuadorian tribes, having brought about the permanent lodgment of Inca <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> parties in <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, led to interformation of a new tribe and the descendants of Inca men with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children from <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>. Collisions ensued between this tribe and the descendants of Inca <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and the strife, Atau-huallpa figured as the leader of the former, whilst the latter recognized Huascar, duly elected <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> chief at <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>. Atau-huallpa acted with great cruelty, nearly exterminating such Ecuadorian tribes as resisted. He finally prevailed, and sent his warriors southward along the backbone of the mountains, against <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>. When Pizarro landed at Tumbez (northern <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> coast) in 1532, the <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> people had already overthrown the Inca tribe at <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a>, taken the settlement, and committed the most horrible cruelties, chiefly against the keepers of ancient traditions whom they attempted to exterminate, so as to wipe out the remembrance of the past of <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a> and begin a new era. Atau-huallpa himself remained with a numerous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> party at Caxamarca. There he awaited the whites, whom he despised. The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> found Caxamarca deserted, and the warriors of Atau-hauallpa camping three miles from the place. Pizarro recognized that a trap had been set for him, and prepared for the worst.

<p>On the evening of the 16th of November, 1532, Atau-hauallpa entered the squared of Caxamarca with a great retinue of men carrying their weapons concealed. They packed the court densely. Pizarro had placed on the roof of the building his artillery (two <em>pedereros</em>) that could not be pointed except horizontally. When the Indians thronged into the square, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, Fray Vicente Valverde, was sent by Pizarro to inform Atau-huallpa, through an interpreter, of the motives of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>' appearance in the country. This embassy was received with scorn, and the friar, seeing the Indians ready to begin hostilities, warned Pizarro. His action has been <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> criticized; Valverde did what was his imperative <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> under the circumstances. Then, not waiting for the Indians to attack the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> to the offensive. The sound of cannon and musketry, and the sight of the horses frightened the Indians so that they fled in dismay, leaving Atau-huallpa a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in the hands of Pizarro, who treated him with proper regard. The stories of a terrible slaughter of the Indians are inordinate exaggerations. While a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, Atau-huallpa caused the greater portion of the gold and silver at <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a> to be turned over to the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and having them massacred. When this was discovered Pizarro had him executed, on the 9th of August, 1633. The execution was not unjustifiable. Atau-huallpa, at the time of his death, was about thirty years of age.
