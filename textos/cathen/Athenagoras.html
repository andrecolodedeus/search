<h1>Athenagoras</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> of the second half of the second century of whom no more is known than that he was an Athenian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and a convert to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Of his writings there have been preserved but two genuine pieces &#151; his "Apology" or "Embassy for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>" and a "Treatise on the Resurrection". The only allusions to him in early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature are the accredited quotations from his "Apology" in a fragment of <a href="../cathen/10243a.htm">Methodius of Olympus</a> (d. 312) and the untrustworthy biographical details in the fragments of the "Christian History" of Philip of Side (c. 425). It may be that his treatises, circulating anonymously, were for a time considered as the work of another <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a>. His writings bear witness to his erudition and culture, his power as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and rhetorician, his keen appreciation of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> temper of his age, and his tact and delicacy in dealing with the powerful opponents of his religion. The "Apology", the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of which is fixed by internal evidence as late in 176 or 177, was not, as the title "Embassy" (<em>presbeia</em>) has suggested, an oral defence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> but a carefully written plea for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> made by a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> grounds, to the Emperors <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> and his son <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a>, conquerors, "but above all, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>". He first complains of the illogical and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> discrimination against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> they suffer (i-iii), and then meets the charge of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a> (iv). He establishes the principle of <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheism</a>, citing <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> poets and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> in support of the very doctrines for which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are condemned (v-vi), and demonstrates the superiority of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to that of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> (vii-viii). This first strongly reasoned demonstration of the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature is supplemented by an able exposition of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity</a> (x). Assuming then the defensive, the <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> justifies the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> abstention from worship of the national <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> (xii-xiv) on grounds of its absurdity and indecency, quoting at length the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> poets and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> in support of his contention (xv-xxx). Finally, he meets the charges of immorality by exposing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideal of purity, even in thought, and the inviolable <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the marriage bond. The charge of cannibalism is refuted by showing the high regard for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> which leads the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to detest the crime of abortion (xxxi-xxxvi). The treatise on the "Resurrection of the Body", the first complete exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature, was written later than the "Apology", to which it may be considered as an appendix. Athenagoras brings to the defence of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> the best that contemporary philosophy could adduce. After meeting the objections common to his time (i), he demonstrates the possibility of a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> in view either of the power of the Creator (ii-iii), or of the nature of our bodies (iv-viii). To exercise such powers is neither unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nor <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to other creatures (ix-xi). He shows that the nature and end of man demand a perpetuation of the life of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.
