<h1>Auckland</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising the Provincial District of Auckland (New Zealand), with its islets, and the Kermadec Group. Area, 21,665 square miles. On <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a>, 1835, the Vicariate Apostolic of the Western Pacific was erected by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>. The Abb&eacute; Jean Baptiste Fran&ccedil;ois Pompallier was chosen as its first vicar. The territory under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> comprised all New Zealand, the present <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariates Apostolic</a> of Fiji, Central Oceanica, British <a href="../cathen/10783a.htm">New Guinea</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/10783a.htm">New Guinea</a>, <a href="../cathen/11017a.htm">New Pomerania</a>, (part of) Gilbert Islands, New Caledonia, Navigators' Islands, New Hebrides, and the Prefectures Apostolic of North Solomon Islands and Northern <a href="../cathen/10783a.htm">New Guinea</a>. The new vicar was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 30 June, and sailed from Havre, 24 December, 1836, accompanied by the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a> Servant and Bataillon (Lyons), Chanel and Bret (Belley), and three lay-brothers. Father Bret died on the voyage. Father Bataillon (afterwards <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Central Oceanica) was left at Wallis Island, and Father Chanel (Blessed Peter Chanel, Protomartyr of Australasia) at Futuna. Dr. Pompallier and Father Servant reached Hokianga (Auckland Province) 10 January, 1838, and were provided for by an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Thomas Poynton. At that time there were probably fewer than 100 white <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in all New Zealand. Other <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a> arrived in 1839 and subsequent years. The missions to the aborigines (Maoris) became very successful, despite grave <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> propagated by Wesleyan trader-missionaries. By April, 1846, about 5,000 had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, "and there were about five or six times as many <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>." In 1845 Dr. Pompallier changed his headquarters to Auckland. In 1848 Auckland and Wellington were erected into <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a> were withdrawn to the Wellington diocese in 1850. The Rev. James McDonald then became the principal missionary to the Auckland Maoris, The Maori missions in New Zealand were paralyzed by the series of native <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> between 1843 and 1869. They were taken up in the Auckland diocese by the Mill Hill Fathers, in 1886. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> were introduced in 1850. In 1868 Dr. Pompallier went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, resigned, and died in 1870. He was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/04514b.htm">Dr. Thomas William Croke</a> (1870-74), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>. After five years, Father Walter Bisschop Steins, S.J., was appointed to Auckland (1879-81). He was succeeded by Dr. John Edmund Luck, O. S. B. (1882-96). The Right Rev. George Michael Lenihan, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 15 November, 1896, succeeded him.
