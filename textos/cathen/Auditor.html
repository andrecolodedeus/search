<h1>Auditor</h1>  

<p>The designation of certain officials of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to hear (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>audire</em>) and examine the causes submitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. They cannot, however, give a decision unless they receive delegated <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. They are, therefore, not judges in the strict sense of the term. These officials have been part of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> since the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Amongst the principal dignitaries bearing this title are: (1) <em>Auditor Papae.</em> This official was at first the adviser of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in consistorial and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> matters, but he afterwards received also judicial power in civil and criminal cases. Since 1831, however, his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> are restricted to certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, such as assisting at the <a href="../cathen/05673a.htm">examinations</a> of episcopal candidates for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the transaction of matters relating to favours, etc. (2) <em>Auditor Camerae</em> or <em>Auditor General.</em> This official originally had very extended powers, such as judging <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeals</a> against the decisions of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and proceeding against <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves in important cases and even punishing them without a special commission from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He could also take cognizance of cases of criminal, and mixed <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>. Nearly all these and similar powers have now been withdrawn, and the tribunal of the <em>Camera Apotolica</em> is at present limited almost entirely to expediting commissions in certain well-defined cases. (3) <em>Auditors of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a></em> were originally <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. By degrees they were constituted into a tribunal, and are said to have derived their name from the round table (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>rota</em>) at which they sat. Important cases laid before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by sovereigns and nations were referred to the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> for judgment, and its decisions became precedents for all other tribunals. It also served as a supreme court for civil cases in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>. At present, however, the Auditors of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> are restricted practically to giving deliberative opinions in processes of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> or <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> and deciding questions of precedence between <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignitaries</a>. They are generally also attached as <a href="../cathen/04323a.htm">Consultors</a> to various <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>.
