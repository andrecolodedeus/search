<h1>Audran</h1>  

<p>The family name of four generations of distinguished French artists, natives of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Lyons, which included eight prominent engravers and two <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>. They flourished in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and some of their productions rank among the finest examples of the art of the burin.

<p>CHARLES, born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1594; died 1674, was the elder of two brothers, some say cousins (the other being Claude the First), who attained reputation as engravers. Charles, who reached by far the greater eminence, after receiving some instruction in drawing, went as a young man to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to study further the engraver's art, and while there produced some plates which attracted attention. He engraved in pure line, and took the work of Cornelius Bloemart, with whom he studied, as his model. On his return from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the engraver lived for some years in Lyons before settling in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Among his two hundred or more plates are several original portraits, including one of Henry II, Prince of Cond&eacute;, and reproductions of works by <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Carracci</a>, <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>, Palma the Younger, <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a> and Lesueur.

<p>CLAUDE the First, born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1597; died at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> 1677, studied with Charles, but in his portrait and allegorical plates, which were not many, adopted a somewhat different manner. He became professor of engraving in the Academy of Lyons, and left, to perpetuate is branch of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and its artistic reputation, three sons: Germain, Claude the Second, and G&eacute;rard, the last of whom became the most famous artist among the Audrans.

<p>GERMAIN, the eldest son of Claude the First, born at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 1631; died 1710, was a pupil of his uncle Charles and worked both in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. Among his plates are portraits of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> and Charles Emmanuel of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> (the latter after F. de la Monce), landscapes after <a href="../cathen/12322c.htm">Poussin</a>, and fancies and ornamental designs, after <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a> among others. His four sons were Claude the Third, Benoit the Elder, Jean, and Louis.

<p>CLAUDE THE SECOND, Son of Claude the First, born at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 1639; died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1684, was the first <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. After receiving instruction in drawing from his uncle Charles, he went to study <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he entered the studio of the celebrated historical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Charles <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>, on whose style he formed his own. Audran was <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun's</a> assistant in the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, among others of his works, of the "Battle of Arbela" and the "Passage of the Granicus". He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in fresco with much skill, under the direction of his master, the grand gallery of the Tuileries, the great staircase at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> near by, at Sceaux, of the ch&acirc;teau of that enlightened patron of art, <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm#I">Prime Minister Colbert</a>.

<p>G&Eacute;RARD, third son of Claude the First, born at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 1640; died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1703, went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, after being taught engraving by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and his uncle, to receive instruction from the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>, who gave him some of his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> to reproduce. He worked in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> four years, and in 1665 went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he remained three years and, it is said became a pupil of <a href="../cathen/09636c.htm">Carlo Maratta</a>. He etched as well as engraved, and produced in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> some plates&mdash;notably, a portrait of <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Pope Clement IX</a> which brought him much admiration. At the suggestion of <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm#I">Colbert</a>, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> sent for the artist and made him engraver to, and pensioner of the king, with apartments at the factory of the Gobelins. This recognition of his great ability spurred Audran to even greater endeavors, in which he was further encouraged by his former patron <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>, more of whose <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> he reproduced notably the "Battles of Alexander." In November 1681, he was made a member of the Royal Academy of Painting. The first productions of G&eacute;rard Audran were stiff and dry, and his subsequent original and vigorously brilliant style is credited to the counsels of <a href="../cathen/09636c.htm">Maratta</a>, Ciro Ferri, and, notably, of his lifelong friend <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>. A second visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was made where was signed the plate after "The Four Cardinal Virtues," by <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>, which is in the church of San Carlo ai Catinari. Among the original works of this famous engraver are the portrait of the Rospigliosi Pope, already alluded to, those of Samuele Sorbiere, Andrea Argoli of Padua, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Benoit Langlois, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a> Henri Arnauld and the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Fran&ccedil;ois du Quesnoy, called Fiamingo, "Wisdom and Abundance above two Genii," and the vignette, "St. Paul preaching at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>". Particularly esteemed among the plates of G&eacute;rard Audran are two after cartoons of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> "The death of Ananias" and "Paul and Barnabas at <a href="../cathen/09478c.htm">Lystra</a>" "The Martyrdom of St. Agnes," after <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>, and "Coriolanus" after <a href="../cathen/12322c.htm">Poussin</a>. Among the other <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> whose works he reproduced are <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, <a href="../cathen/06572a.htm">Giulio Romano</a>, <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Annibale Caracci</a>, <a href="../cathen/02516a.htm">Pietro da Cortona</a>, Guercino, <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>, Palma the Younger, <a href="../cathen/08786a.htm">Lanfranco</a>, <a href="../cathen/10289a.htm">Mignard</a>, Coypel, Lesueur, Bourguignon, Lafage, and Girardon. He was at times assisted by his nephews, Benoit the Elder and Jean. In 1683 G&eacute;rard published a work called "The Proportions of the Human Body measured by the most Beautiful Figures of Antiquity which has been translated into English.

<p>CLAUDE THE THIRD, son of Germain, and the second <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 1658; died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1734, was notable as being the master of the famous <a href="../cathen/15568a.htm">Watteau</a>. He studied with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> as well as under his uncles, Germain and Claude the Second. Chosen cabinet <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> to the king, he was also for nearly thirty years keeper of the palace of the Luxembourg, where he died. He executed considerable work in oil and fresco in various royal residences.

<p>BENOIT THE ELDER, third son of Germain, born at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 1661; died 1721, in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, was first taught the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> art by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and then by his uncle G&eacute;rard. He made an excellent reputation by his reproduction of portraits and historical works. Among his best productions are "The Seven Sacraments," after <a href="../cathen/12322c.htm">Poussin</a>, and "The Bronze Serpent," after <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>. He became a Member of the Academy and engraver to the king.

<p>JEAN, fourth son of Germain, born at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 1667; died 1756, became, next to his celebrated uncle G&eacute;rard, the best engraver of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. He studied first under his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and then with his uncle. He had already distinguished himself at the early age of twenty. He was rewarded for his subsequent successes by being made (in 1907) engraver to the king, with regular pension and the Gobelin apartments. This was followed next year by membership in the Academy. Jean Audran worked until he was eighty. His masterpiece is considered to be "The Rape of the Sabines", after <a href="../cathen/12322c.htm">Poussin</a>. Among his plates are portraits after Gobert, those of Louis XV, Vandyke, Coypel, Largilliere, Rigaud, Trevisani, and Vivien, and compositions after, among others, <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Caracci</a>, <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>, <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>, <a href="../cathen/02516a.htm">Pietro da Cortona</a>, <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>, <a href="../cathen/09636c.htm">Maratta</a>, Philippe de Champagne, Marot, <a href="../cathen/12322c.htm">Poussin</a>, and Nattier. His son was Benoit the Younger.

<p>LOUIS, the youngest son of Germain, born at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. 1670 died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, c. 1712, studied with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and his uncle G&eacute;rard. He assisted his brothers, and did few original plates. A work of his to be noted is "The Seven Acts of Mercy", after Bourdon.

<p>BENOIT the Younger, born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1698; died in the same place 1772, was the last of the remarkable <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to have any historical importance artistically. He was a pupil of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and did plates after, among others, <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Veronese</a>, <a href="../cathen/12322c.htm">Poussin</a>, <a href="../cathen/15568a.htm">Watteau</a>, Lancret, and Natoire.

<p>PROSPER GABRIEL, a grandson of Jean, born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1744; died, 1819; he studied with his uncle, Benoit the Younger, and etched some heads. He gave up art for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and became professor of Hebrew in the Coll&egrave;ge de France.
