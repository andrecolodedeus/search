<h1>Augsburg</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Kingdom of Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, suffragan of the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich-Freising</a>, embracing the entire government district of Swabia and Neuburg, the western part of the government district of Upper <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and a small part of the government district of Central Franconia.
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>
<h3 id="A">Early period</h3>

<p>The present city of Augsburg appears in Strabo as Damasia, a stronghold of the Licatii; in 14 B.C. it became a Roman colony known as Augusta Vindelicorum, received the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a city from Hadrian and soon became of great importance as an arsenal and the point of junction of several important trade routes. The beginnings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> within the limits of the present <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are shrouded in obscurity its teachings were probably brought thither by soldiers or merchants. According to the acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/01180b.htm">St. Afra</a>, who with her handmaids suffered at the stake for Christ, there existed in Augsburg, early in the fourth century, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community under Bishop Narcissus; St. Dionysius, uncle of <a href="../cathen/01180b.htm">St. Afra</a>, is mentioned as his Successor.
<h3 id="B">Medieval period</h3>

<p>Nothing authentic is known about the history of the Augsburg Church during the centuries immediately succeeding, but it survived the collapse of Roman power in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the turbulence of the great migrations. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that two catalogues of the Bishops of Augsburg, dating from the eleventh and twelfth centuries, mention several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this primitive period, but the first whose record has received indubitable historical corroboration is St. Wikterp (or Wicbpert) who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> about 739 or 768. He took part in several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> convened by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; in company with <a href="../cathen/09536a.htm">St. Magnus</a>, he founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of F&uuml;ssen; and with <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> he dedicated the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Benediktbeuren. Under either St. Wikterp or his successor, Tazzo (or Tozzo), about whom little is known, many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were established, e.g. Wessobrunn, <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, Polling, Ottobeuren. At this time, also, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, hitherto suffragan to the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, was placed among the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of the newly founded <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Archdiocese of Mainz</a> (746). St. Sintpert (c. 810), hitherto <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Murbach, and a relative of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, renovated many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> laid waste in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> and Bavarians, and during the incursions of the Avari; he built the first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Augsburg in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Most Blessed Virgin</a>; and obtained from the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Emperor Charlemagne</a> an exact definition of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> limits. His <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extended at that time from the Iller eastward over the Lech, north of the Danube to the Alb, and south to the spurs of the Alps. Moreover, various estates and villages in the valley of the Danube, and in the Tyrol, belonged to the diocese. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the following period a certain number are especially prominent, either on account of the offices they filled in the Empire, or for their personal qualifications; thus Witgar (887-87), Chancellor and Archchaplain of Louis the German; Adalbero (887-910), of the line of the Counts of Dillingen, confidant and friend of Emperor Arnulf, who entrusted Adalbero with the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his son, the German King Louis the Child, distinguished for generosity to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The See of Augsburg reached the period of its greatest splendor under St. Ulrich (923-973); he raised the standard of training and discipline among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by the reformation of existing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the establishment of new ones, and by canonical visitations and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>; he provided for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and rebuilt decayed churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. During the incursion of the Hungarians and the siege of Augsburg (955), he sustained the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of the citizens, compelled the Hungarians to withdraw, and contributed much to the decisive victory on the Lechfeld (955). He built churches in honor of <a href="../cathen/01180b.htm">St. Afra</a> and St. John, founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Stephen for <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and undertook three <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The diocese suffered much during the episcopate of his successor, Henry I (973-982), for he sided with the foes of Emperor <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, and remained for several months in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. After his liberation he renounced his former views and bequeathed to his church his possessions at Geisenhausen. The diocese attained great splendor under Bishop Bruno (1006-20), brother of Emperor Henry II; he restored a number of ruined <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, founded the church and college of <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a>, placed <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the collegiate church of <a href="../cathen/01180b.htm">St. Afra</a>, and added to the episcopal possessions by the gift of his own inheritance of Straubing. Under Bishop Henry II (1047-63), the guardian of Henry IV, the diocese secured the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> was enriched by many donations; under Embrico (or Emmerich, 1063-77) the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was dedicated (1065) and the canonicate and <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/06028a.htm">St. Felicitas</a> were built. During the last years of his episcopate the quarrel of <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in which Embrico took the imperial side and only temporarily yielded to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>. The struggle continued under his successors; four anti-bishops were set up in opposition to Siegfried II (1077-96). Hermann, Count von Vohburg (1096 or 1097-1132) supported with treachery and cunning his claim to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> he had purchased, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/01180b.htm">St. Afra</a>, and expelled him from the city. Only after the conclusion of the Concordat of Worms (1122) did Hermann obtain the confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and relief from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. The political disturbances resulting from the dissensions between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the German emperors reacted on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Augsburg. There were short periods of rest, during which <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life received a forward impulse, as, for instance, under Bishop Walther II Count Palatine von Dillingen (1133-52), under whom the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were again consolidated and increased by his own inheritance; under Udalskalk (1184-1202), who with great <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> placed the recently discovered bones of St. Ulrich in the new church of Sts. Ulrich and Afra. These days of peace alternated with periods of conflict into which the Bishops of Augsburg were drawn, often against their will, in their capacity as Princes of the Empire, and the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> accordingly suffered decline. Under Siboto von Lechfeld (1227-47) <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the newly founded <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> were first established in Augsburg. A celebrated member of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> was <a href="../cathen/04644a.htm">David of Augsburg</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> of Lauingen. Additional causes of conflict were the troubles that arose between the Bishops of Augsburg and the city authorities. During the struggles between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the emperors, Augsburg like other large cities throughout the greater part of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, attained enormous wealth, owing to the industrial and commercial activity of the citizens. From time to time efforts were made to restrict as much as possible the ancient civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and their stewards, and even to abrogate them entirely. From a state of discontent the citizens passed to open <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> under the Bishop Hartmann von Dillingen (1248-86), and wrung from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> many municipal liberties and advantages. A characteristic instance is the confirmation by Emperor Rudolph of Habsburg at the Reichstag held in Augsburg (1276) of the Stadtbuch, or municipal register, containing the ancient customs, episcopal and municipal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, etc., specified in detail; on the same occasion Augsburg was recognized as a Free City of the Empire. Hartmann bequeathed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Augsburg his paternal inheritance, including the town and castle of Dillingen. Peace reigned under the succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, of whom Frederick I (1309-31) acquired for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> the castle and stronghold of F&uuml;ssen; Ulrich II, von Schoneck (1331-37), and his brother Henry III (1337-48) remained faithful to Emperor Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, Markward I, von Randeck (1348-65), again redeemed the mortgaged <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and by the favor of Emperor Charles IV was made <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> (1365). New dissensions between the Bishop and the city arose under Burkhard von Ellerbach (1373-1404), whose accession was marked by grave discord growing out of the overthrow of the <em>Patrizier</em>, or aristocratic government, and the rise in municipal power of the crafts or guilds. Irritated by Burkhard's support of the nobility in their struggle with the Swabian cities, the inhabitants of Augsburg plundered the dwellings of the canons, drove some of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from the city (1381), destroyed, after a short interval of respite (1388), the episcopal strong-hold, the deanery, and the mint, and became almost completely independent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Burkhard proceeded with great energy against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclifites</a> who had gained a foothold in Augsburg and condemned to the stake five <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> refused to <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a>. After the death of Eberhard II (1404-13), a quarrel arose in 1413 because the city of Augsburg declined to recognize the lawful Bishop, Anselm von Nenningen (1413-23), and set up in opposition Friedrich von Grafeneek who had been presented by Emperor Sigismund. This trouble was settled by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a>, who compelled both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to resign, and on his own authority replaced them by Peter von Schauenberg, Canon of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> and <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (1423-69).



<p>Peter was endowed by the Pope with extraordinary faculties, made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere</em> for all <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He worked with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy for the reformation of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, held <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and made episcopal visitations in order to raise the decadent moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; he restored the discipline and renewed the fallen splendor of many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, canonries and collegiate churches. He completed the rebuilding of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it in 1431 and in 1457 laid the cornerstone of the new church of Sts. Ulrich and Afra. Succeeding <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> carried on the reformation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with no less solicitude and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Among them were Johann II, Count of Werdenberg (1469-86), tutor to the emperor's son, afterwards Emperor Maximilian I, who convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> in Dillingen, and encouraged the recently invented art of printing; Friedrich von Zollern (1486-1505) pupil of the great preacher <a href="../cathen/06403c.htm">Geiler von Kaysersberg</a>, and founder of a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in Dillingen, who held a synod in the same city, promoted the printing of <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>, and greatly enriched the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Henry IV, von Lichtenau (1505-17), a great friend and benefactor of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and patron of the arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. During the episcopate of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Augsburg acquired through the industry of its citizens, a world-wide commerce. Some members of its <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, e.g. the Fuggers and the <a href="../cathen/15582a.htm">Welsers</a>, were the greatest merchants of their time; they lent large sums of money to the emperors and princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, conducted the financial enterprises of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and even extended their operations to the newly discovered continent of America. Among the citizens of Augsburg famous at that time in literature and art were the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> <a href="../cathen/11784d.htm">Conrad Peutinger</a>; the brothers Bernard and Conrad Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden; Matthias Lang, secretary to Emperor Frederick III, and later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>; the distinguished <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbein the elder</a>, <a href="../cathen/03064c.htm">Burgkmair</a> and others. With wealth, however, came a spirit of worldliness and cupidity. Pride and a super-refinement of culture furnished the rank soil in which the impending <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">religious revolution</a> was to find abundant nourishment.
<h3 id="C">Reformation period</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> brought disaster on the Diocese of Augsburg. It included 1,050 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with more than 500,000 inhabitants. Besides the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter it could boast eight collegiate foundations, forty-six <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for men, and thirty-eight <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, who was summoned to vindicate himself in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> before the Reichstag at Augsburg (1518), found enthusiastic adherents in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> among both the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but especially among the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, in whose <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Anne he dwelt; he also found favor among the city councillors, burghers, and tradesmen. Bishop Christopher von Stadion (1517-43) did all in his power to arrest the spread of the now teachings; he called learned men to the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, among others Urbanus Rhegius, who, however, soon went over to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>; he convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>, at which it was forbidden to read <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> writings; he <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> throughout his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> (1520) against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>; he forbade the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, who were spreading the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, to preach; he warned the magistrates of Augsburg, Memmingen, and other places not to tolerate the reformers, and he adopted other similar measures. Despite all this, the followers of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> obtained the upper hand in the city council, and by 1524, various <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> usages, notably the observance of fast days, had been abolished in Augsburg. The <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, many of whom, after <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> example, had taken wives, were supported by the city council, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were denied the right of preaching. The <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> also gained a strong following and added fuel to the fire of the <a href="../cathen/11597a.htm">Peasants' War</a>, in which many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, institutions, and castles were destroyed. At the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, at which the so-called Augsburg Confession was delivered to Emperor V in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the episcopal palace, the emperor issued an edict according to which all innovations were to be abolished, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> reinstated in their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The city council, however, set itself up in opposition, recalled (1531) the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> preachers who had been expatriated, suppressed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> services in all churches except the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (1534), and in 1537 joined the League of Smalkald. At the beginning of this year a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the council was made, forbidding everywhere the celebration of Mass, preaching, and all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ceremonies, and giving to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the alternative of enrolling themselves anew as citizens or leaving the city. An overwhelming majority of both <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> chose banishment; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> withdrew with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter to Dillingen, whence he addressed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor an appeal for the redress of his grievances. In the city of Augsburg the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches were seized by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglian</a> preachers; at the command of the council pictures were removed, and at the instigation of <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a> and others a disgraceful storm of popular iconoclasm followed, resulting in the destruction of many splendid monuments of art and antiquity. The greatest intolerance was exercised towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had remained in the city; their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were dissolved; <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were compelled to send their children to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> institutions; it was even forbidden to hear Mass outside the city under severe penalties.

<p>Under Otto Truchsess von Waldburg (1543-73) the first signs of improvement were noted in the attitude towards <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. At the outbreak of hostilities (1546) between the emperor and the League of Smalkald, Augsburg, as a member of the league, took up arms against <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, and Bishop Otto invested and plundered F&uuml;ssen, and confiscated nearly all the remaining possessions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. After the victory at Muhlberg (1547), however, the imperial troops marched against Augsburg, and the city was forced to beg for mercy, surrender twelve pieces of artillery, pay a fine, restore the greater number of churches to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and reimburse the diocese and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> confiscated. In 1547 the Bishop, Otto von Truchsess, who had meanwhile been created a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> returned to the city with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, followed shortly after by the emperor. At the Diet held at Augsburg in 1548 the so-called "Augsburg Interim" was arranged. After a temporary occupation of the city and suppression of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> services by the Elector, Prince Maurice of Saxony (1551), the "Religious Peace of Augsburg" was concluded at the Diet of 1555; it was followed by a long period of peace. The disturbances of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> were more disastrous in their results throughout the diocese and adjoining lands than within the immediate precincts of Augsburg. Thus, after many perturbations and temporary restorations of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> finally gained the upper hand in <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, Oettingen, Neuburg, the free cities of N&ouml;rdlingen, Memmingen, Kaufbeuren, Dinkelsbuhl, Donauw&ouml;rth, Ulm, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territory of Feuchtwangen and elsewhere. Altogether during these years of religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> the Diocese of Augsburg lost to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> about 250 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 24 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and over 500 <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. Although the religious upheaval brought with it a great loss of worldly possessions, it was not without beneficial effect on <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Bishop Christopher von Stadion while trying to protect <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> from the inroads of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, had sought to strengthen and revive <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> disciple, which had sadly declined, among both the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The work was carried on even more energetically by Bishop Otto Truchsess, who achieved a fruitful counter-reformation. By frequent visitations he sought to become familiar with existing evils, and by means of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and a vigorous enforcement of measures against <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and dissolute <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a>, he endeavored to remedy these conditions. He advanced the cause of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> by founding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; he summoned the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, among others Blessed Peter Canisius, who from 1549, in the capacity, of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> preacher, confessor, and catechist, exercised a remarkable fruitful and efficacious ministry. In 1549 Bishop Otto founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in Dillingen for the training of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (1554) a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> raising it to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and in 1564 gave the direction of the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, for whom he had built a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in Dillingen. It is due to his untiring labours and those of Canisius that much larger portions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were not lost to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Under the immediate successors of Otto the revival instituted by him progressed rapidly, and many excellent decrees were formulated. Under Marquard II von Berg (1575-91) a pontifical boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (alumnatus) was founded in Dillingen, colleges were established by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in Landsberg, and through the bounty of the Fugger <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, in Augsburg (1580). Heinrich von Knoringen, made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the early age of twenty-eight, took especial interest in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and the Seminary of Dillingen, both of which he enriched with many endowments; he convened several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, converted Duke Wolfgang of Neuburg to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and during his long episcopate (1598-1646) reconciled many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cities and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, being aided in a particular manner by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, for whom he founded establishments in Neuburg, Memmingen, and Kaufbeuren. By means of the Edict of Restitution of Emperor Ferdinand II (1629), vigorously and even too forcefully executed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> first accomplished an almost complete restoration of the former possessions of the Diocese of Augsburg. The occupation of Augsburg by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden (1632) restored temporarily the balance of power to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Until the relief of the city by the imperial troops (1635) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were hard pressed and were forced to give up all they had gained by the Edict of Restitution. Finally the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648) established equality between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and was followed by a long period of internal peace. On account of the losses entailed on the diocese by the treaty, a solemn protest was laid before the imperial chancery by Bishop Sigmund Franz, Archduke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1646-65). This <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on account of his youth, ruled the diocese through administrators, and later resigned his office. His successor, Johann Christopher von Freiberg (1665-90), was particularly desirous of liquidating the heavy burden of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> borne by the chapter, but was nevertheless generous towards churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. His successor, Alexander Sigmund (1690-1737), son of the Palatine Elector, guarded the purity of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, books and <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayerbooks</a>. Johann Friedrich von Stauffenberg (1737-40) founded the Seminary of Meersbury and introduced missions among the people. Joseph, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt (1740-68) exhumed with great <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> the bones of St. Ulrich and instituted an investigation into the life of Crescentia Hoss of Kaufbeuren, who died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Klemens Wenzeslaus, Prince of Saxony and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1768-1812), made a great number of excellent disciplinary regulations, and took measures for their execution; after the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> he afforded its members protection and employment in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; he made a vigorous resistance to the rapidly spreading <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> and <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidelity</a>, and was honored by a visit from <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pope Pius VI</a> (1782).
<h3 id="D">French Revolution and secularization</h3>

<p>During this episcopate began the world-wide upheaval inaugurated by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. It was destined to put an end to the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and to bring about the fall of Augsburg from the dignity of a principality of the Empire. In 1802, by act of the Delegation of the Imperial Diet (<em>Reichsdeputationsrezess</em>), the territory of the Diocese of Augsburg was given to the Elector of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, who took possession 1 December, 1802. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, together with forty canonicates, forty-one <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, nine colleges, twenty-five <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, thirty-four <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, and two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were the victims of this act of secularization. Unfortunately, owing to the inconsiderate conduct of the commissioners appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> minister, Montgelas, innumerable artistic treasures, valuable books, and documents were destroyed. For five years after the death of the last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of princely rank (1812) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>; the parts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> lying outside of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> were separated from it and annexed to other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. It was not until 1817 that the Concordat between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> government reconstructed the Diocese of Augsburg, and made it subject to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich-Freising</a>. In 1821 the territory subject to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority of Augsburg was increased by the addition of sections of the suppressed <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">See of Constance</a>, and the present limits were then defined.
<h3 id="E">The nineteenth century</h3>

<p>As the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Franz Karl von Hohenlohe-Schillingsfurst, died (1819) before assuming office, and Joseph Maria von Fraunberg was soon called to the <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">archiepiscopal See of Bamberg</a>, there devolved upon their successors the important task of rearranging the external conditions and reanimating <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, which had suffered sorely. Ignatius Albert von Riegg (1824-36) was successful in his endeavors to further the interests of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, to raise the standard of popular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> through the medium of numerous ordinances and frequent visitations. He assigned the administration and direction of studies in the Lyceum to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of St. Stephen in Augsburg, founded by King Ludwig (1834). Petrus von Richarz (1837-55) displayed energy and persistent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in promoting the interests of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in general, and encouraged the giving of missions to the people, the establishment of many religious institutions for the care of the sick and for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> purposes, and carefully superintended the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The same spirit characterized the labours of the succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Michael von Deinlein (1856-58), who after a short episcopate was raised to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>; Pankratius von Dinkel (1858-94), under whom both <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and the deaf and dumb asylum were established in Dillingen, and many monastic institutions were founded; Petrus von Hotzl (1895-1902) whose episcopate was marked by the attention paid to social and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> pursuits, and the number of missions given among the people as well as by the solemn celebration of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> Crescentia Hoss. He was succeeded by Maximilian von Lingg, born at Nesselwang, 8 March, 1842; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 22 July, 1865; appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 18 March, 1902, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 20 July, 1002.
<h2 id="section2">Religious statistics</h2>

<p>According to the census of 1 December, 1900, the Diocese of Augsburg contained 777,958 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and about 100,000 of other <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>; at present there are about 818,074 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Socially, the population is chiefly of the middle class; recently, however, on account of the greater growth of the industrial arts in the city of Augsburg in Lechhausen, Memmingen, and other places, the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes are increasing in numbers. Leaving out of consideration the larger cities, in which the various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> are well represented, it may be said that the southern part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Algau and the adjoining parts of Altbayern (Bavaria proper), are almost entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, while in the northern part a mixture of creeds predominates. That small portion of Mittelfranken (Fran-conia) which belongs to the, diocese, is overwhelmingly <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The relations between the various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denominations</a> are in general friendly and peaceable. For the work of sacred ministry the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into 40 deaneries (1 city deanery at Augsburg, and 39 rural deaneries), with 862 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 31 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> curacies, 16 curacies, 226 <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, 6 preaching-offices (<em>Pr&auml;dikaturen</em>), 227 chaplaincies. In general each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> is complete and independent; but in the mountainous southern section there are many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, to which are attached from fifty to a hundred dependent churches (<em>Filiakirchen</em>). The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists of the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, a dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, 8 canons and 6 vicars. In 1907 the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> numbered 1,439: 815 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>, 49 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> vicars, 11 <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>, 73 <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>, 53 vicars of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, 180 <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> and <a href="../cathen/12407a.htm">assistant priests</a>, 49 <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendaries</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> professors (not including the professors of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of St. Stephen in Augsburg); 74 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> temporarily stationed in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 95 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regulars</a>, 40 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> engaged in other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> or on missions. Of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men there are the following establishments: <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, 3 (Augsburg, Andechs, Ottobeuren), with 33 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 56 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; Mission Society of St. Benedict, I (St. Ottilien), with 36 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (12 at present outside the diocese), 31 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 117 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, 3, with 7 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 22 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, 5, with 28 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 15 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and 37 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; Brothers of Mercy, 6, with 4 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 54 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. Altogether there are 18 establishments conducted by the male orders, with 108 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 55 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and 286 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. Far more numerous are the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders and religious congregations; they number 226 establishments and branches, with 2,815 members.

<h2 id="section3">Education</h2>

<p>As the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> are the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the local civic corporation and under State control, there are no <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the strict sense of the word, According to the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Constitution of 1818 nothing move is assured to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> than the direction of religious instruction and the surveillance of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. She exercises this right in 1,074 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the Diocese of Augsburg, by means of 6 <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> county (<em>Bezirk</em>) school-inspectors and 50 <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> district school-inspectors. However, in many of the girls' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (<em>M&auml;dchenschulen</em>) the direction of studies is confined entirely to religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> under State inspection. Thus the Poor School Sisters have charge of the studies in 19 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in 35, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in 11, the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Ursberg in 3; the English Ladies are excellent teachers for the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and conduct 11 institutes for girls. For the training of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> there are the Lyceum and the Diocesan Seminary for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>; the Diocesan Seminary for boys at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>; St. Stephen's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> House of Studies at Augsburg, under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, which includes a Lyceum, a classical Gymnasium a royal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of studies and a institute for higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; there are besides about forty students of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Augsburg who dwell in the Georgianum at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and attend the courses of the,University. The state, or communal, institutions of higher studies for boys number 28 in the Diocese of Augsburg; 5 gymnasia, 1 <em>Realgymnasium</em>, 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of studies, 5 <em>Progymnasia</em> 2, Latin <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 7 <em>Realschulen</em>, 3 agricultural winter <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 <em>Realschule</em> with Latin, 1 normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and 2 preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. We must also mention the Cassianeum in Donauworth, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institute of pedagogy, which includes a training-school, a publishing house for books and periodicals, a printing press and other appurtenances. In all of these institutions <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> instruction is given to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> students by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Charitable institutions</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are for the most part the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the civic <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or the unions (<em>Vereine</em>), or local associations; they are administered, however, mostly by <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities to whom is also confided the care of the sick, or children, and of the aged. There are 37 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 424 infirmaries, 12 protectories, 2 asylums for children, 8 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 3 institutions for the deaf and dumb, 12 houses for the poor and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, 3 poorhouses, 1 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for Priests 1 home for invalids, 3 institutions for servants under the patronage of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> (<em>Marienanstalten</em>), 1 House of St. Anne (<em>Annastift</em>) for the factory girls in Augsburg, 1 House of St. Elizabeth for incurables, 5 institutions for various other purposes (e.g. the Kneippianum in Worishofen). One <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institution of Augsburg deserves special mention: the Fuggerei, founded in 1519 by three brothers (Ulrich, Georg, and Jakob) of the Fuggers. It consists of an extensive block of 53 houses with 106 apartments; in accordance with the conditions of the foundation these must be let at a very small rent to indigent cut people. It is a noble and durable memorial of the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">Christian charity</a> that abounded in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Catholic Middle Ages</a>. In recent times other works of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">Christian charity</a> have been inaugurated. The good <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and superintendent of studies (<em>Regens</em>), Father Wagner of Dillingen, established many institutions for the deaf, dumb, and blind; Father Ringeisen, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Ursberg, established there the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> for the exercise of every form of charity. For aged and infirm <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> there exists a fund with 1,277 subscribers and a reserve of 1,550,000 marks ($387,500). There is also an association for the support of infirm <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, with 792 members and a fund of 26,000 marks ($6,500). Prominent among the numerous social-political and religious associations of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are 16 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apprentices unions, (<em>Lehrlingsvereine</em>), the local union in Augsburg maintaining its own home for apprentices; 49 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journeymen's unions (<em>Gesellenvereine</em>), 4 Unions of St Joseph; 52 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> workingmen's unions; 19 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> students' clubs; 3 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> clubs for working <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with 504 members; 7 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> "Patronages" for working people; the Ulrich-union for the support of <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>; the Men's Catholic Association, the Christian Peasants' League; the Cecilian Club; St. Mary's Protectory for girls; the Young Women's Association, and the Association of Christian Mothers. Annual <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> give visible evidence of the vigorous <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Such <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> are those of the Holy Cross (11 May) and to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Ulrich at Augsburg (4 July). There are also processions to the holy mountain of Andechs during the rogation days, and to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Lechfeld since the year of the cholera (1854). Other <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> are those to the relics of St. Rasso at Grafrath, to the church of the Holy Sepulcher (<em>Unsers Herrn Ruh</em>) near Friedberg, and to Maria Siebeneich.
<h2 id="section5">Ecclesiastical art and monuments</h2>

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> monuments of the Diocese of Augsburg the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> holds first place. It was begun in the Roman style in 994, dedicated 1010, and remodeled, 1331-1431, into a <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> with five <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>; it was then that the lofty east choir with its circle of <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> was added. The towers were increased in height in 1488-89 and 1564. Among the innumerable art treasures of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> may be mentioned the vestments of St. Ulrich; the tour altars with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">elder Holbein</a> illustrating the life of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>; the celebrated bronze doors of the left lateral <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, adorned with remark able reliefs, and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the first half of the eleventh century; the ancient stained windows, some of which back to the eleventh and twelfth centuries; the interesting <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> and slabs of the fourteenth and succeeding centuries, both in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> itself and in the adjoining <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, and many other objects of value and interest. The church of Sts. Ulrich and Afra, built 1467-1594, in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Ulrich, the stone sarcophagus of <a href="../cathen/01180b.htm">St. Afra</a>, the Fugger <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> with the memorial to Hans Fugger, and three magnificent altars in <a href="../cathen/13106a.htm">rococo style</a>. The late <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of the Holy Cross was renovated, early in the eighteenth century, in florid Roman <a href="../cathen/13106a.htm">rococo style</a>, and is a favorite place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. Among the chief <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> edifices outside the city of Augsburg are the Romanesque <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of Altenstadt, Ursberg, Thierhaupten; the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of Kaisheim, Dinkelsbuhl, Donauworth, Landsberg; the ancient abbey-churches of Andechs (very rich in relies and costly <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a>), Benediktbeuren, Diessen, F&uuml;ssen, Kempten, Ottobeuren, and Wessobrunn, all restored and ornamented in sumptuous <a href="../cathen/02303b.htm">barocco</a> or <a href="../cathen/13106a.htm">rococo style</a>.
