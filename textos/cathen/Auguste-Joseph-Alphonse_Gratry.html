<h1>Auguste-Joseph-Alphonse Gratry</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and writer; b. at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, 30 March, 1805; d. at Montreux, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 7 February, 1872. After brilliantly finishing his classical studies, he entered the polytechnic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. At the end of his course, (1828), he went to <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, spent some months at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Bischenberg, and decided to become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> on 22 December, 1832, and remained there for several years with <a href="../cathen/02353a.htm">Bautain</a>. In 1841, Gratry became director of the Coll&egrave;ge Stanislas in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but, in 1846, accepted the position of <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the "Ecole normale sup&eacute;rieure". It was then that he published his first work: "Demandes et r&eacute;ponses sur les devoirs sociaux".

<p>When Vacherot, director of studies at the Ecole normale, published the third volume of his "Histoire de l'Ecole d'Alexandrie", a polemic took place between him and Gratry; Vacherot was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and Gratry himself resigned his charge one year later (1851). After a year spent at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Bishop Dupanloup</a>, Gratry united his efforts with Abb&eacute; P&eacute;titot, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, for the restoration in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> of the Oratory under the name of Oratoire de l'Immacul&eacute;e Conception. In 1863, Gratry was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> in the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; and in 1867 he was elected a member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>, succeeding Barante in the <em>fauteuil</em> once occupied by Voltaire. At the time of the Council of the Vatican (1870), he declared himself against the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> in several letters, edited under the title "Monseigneur l'Ev&ecirc;que d'Orl&eacute;ans et Monseigneur l'Archev&ecirc;que de Malines". These were condemned by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and Gratry, who had already lived for almost ten years outside of his community and had been publicly reproved by his superior in 1869 for his participation in a certain association, formed under the name of the International League for Peace, had to sever his connexion with the Oratory. After the proclamation of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, Gratry gave his full and sincere adhesion to the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, and, when Archbishop Guibert had taken possession of the See of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in December, 1871, he wrote him a public letter wherein he retracted all that he had written against the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a>. He was then suffering from an abscess on the neck; he went to Montreux, near the Lake of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, and died there in 1872. Among the chief works of Gratry, besides those already named are: "Une Etude sur la sophistique contemporaine, ou Lettre &agrave; M. Vacherot" (Paris, 1851); "De la Connaissance de Dieu" (2 vols., Paris, 1853); "Logique" (2 vols., Paris, 1856); "De la Connaissance de l'Ame" (2 vols., Paris, 1858); "La Philosophie du Credo" (1861); "Les Sources" (1862); "Commentaire sur l'Evangile de Saint Matthieu" (2 vols., 1863); "Les Sophistes et la Critique" (Paris, 1864); "Henri Pereyve" (Paris, 1866); "La Morale et la Loi de l'Histoire" (2 vols., Paris, 1868); Les Sources de la R&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;ration sociale" (a reprint with some changes of his first work); "Souvenirs de ma Jeunesse" (1874); "Meditations in&eacute;dites" (1874).

<p>Gratry exercised a great influence during his life by his <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> &#151; distinguished for greatness of thought, generosity of heart, and optimistic enthusiasm &#151; and, after his death, by his works. In the last twenty years his books have been frequently reprinted. Among those who came under his influence, we may mention especially, Charles and Adolphe (later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) Perraud, Heinrich, de Margerie, <a href="../cathen/11134a.htm">Nourrisson</a>, H. Pereyve, and L&eacute;on Oll&eacute;-Laprune. Concerning Gratry's <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> conceptions we may say that the pregnant <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which underlies his philosophy is to be found in two of his fundamental principles: (1) that we must seek the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with our whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that is, with all the faculties and helps given to us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; our sensibility, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, reason, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the light of revelation &#151; and with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> moral condition. (2) That a thing is truly known only through its relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, its author and ruler, as man is truly developed only through his ascent toward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his creator and his end. But when he comes to determine the respective values and relation of these faculties, Gratry, with a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> naturally sensitive, seems to yield too much to feeling and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the relations between reason and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are not always clearly respected. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for him, is felt or experienced rather than thought or known through reasoning. He is felt by the "divine sense" through the <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> process which is analogous to the <a href="../cathen/07779a.htm">inductive</a> process in physics and the infinitesimal process in mathematics; in presence of a certain degree of beauty and perfection perceived in nature, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> develops in itself a capacity for exaltation, which raises it from the finite to the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. These indeed are high and inspiring thoughts, but the clear statement of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> requires a stricter analysis and a more vigorous treatment. These characteristics, however, explain the feeling of attraction mixed with anxiety one feels on perusing Gratry's works; they help one to understand the ideal grandeur of the moral inspirations and the vague Utopian dreaminess one meets in such close juxtaposition on many of his pages.
