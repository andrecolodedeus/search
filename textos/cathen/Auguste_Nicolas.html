<h1>Auguste Nicolas</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, 6 Jan., 1807; d. at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a> 18 Jan., 1888. He first studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, was admitted as an advocate and entered the magistracy. From 1841-49 he was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the peace at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>; as early as 1842 he began the publication of his apologetical writings which soon made his name known among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. When in 1849 M. de Falloux became minister of public worship he summoned Nicolas to assist him as head of the department for the administration of the temporal interests of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> districts. He held this office until 1854 when he became general inspector of <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>. In 1860 he was appointed judge of' the tribunal of the Seine and finally councillor at the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> court of appeals.

<p>Nicolas employed his leisure and later his retirement to write works in defense of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> taken as a whole or in its most important <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. He showed his accurate conception of <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> by adapting them to the dispositions and the needs of the minds of his time, but he lived in a period when <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a> still dominated many <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and this is reflected in his works. He aimed no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> at defending religion by means of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, good sense, and arguments from authority; but he also often appeals to the traditions and the groping moral sense of man-kind at large. The testimonies, however, which he cites, are often <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> and frequently also he interprets them uncritically and ascribes to them a meaning or a scope which they do not possess. Besides, his <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> speedily grew out-of-date when <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and critical studies were revived in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and elsewhere. His writings also betray at times the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> lacking in the learning and precision of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and some of his books were in danger of being placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a>. Some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, however, among them Cardinals <a href="../cathen/05132a.htm">Donnet</a> and Pie, intervened in his behalf and certified to the uprightness of his intentions. Otherwise the author addressed himself to the general public and especially to the middle classes which were still penetrated with Voltairian incredulity, and he succeeded in reaching them. His books were very successful in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and some of them even in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where they were translated. Among his works may be mentioned: "Etudes philosophiques sur le Christianisme" (Paris, 1841-45), a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> apology for the chief <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, which reached a twenty-sixth edition before the death of the author; "La Vierge Marie et le plan divin, nouvelles &eacute;tudes philosophiques sur le Christianisme" (4 vols., Paris, 1852, 1853, 1861), in which is explained the role of the Blessed Virgin in the plan of Redemption, and which was translated into German, and reached the eighth edition during the author's lifetime; "Du protestantisme et de toutes les h&eacute;r&eacute;sies dans leur rapport avec le socialisme" (Paris, 1852, 2 vols., 8 editions), "L'Art de croire, ou pr&eacute;paration philosophique au Christianisme" (Paris, 1866-67), translated into German; "La Divinit&eacute; de J&eacute;&eacute;sus Christ, d&eacute;monstration nouvelle" (1864); "J&eacute;sus Christ introduction &agrave; l'Evangile &eacute;tudi&eacute; et medit&eacute; &agrave; l'usage des temps nouveaux" (Paris, 1875). As semi-religious and semi-political may be mentioned: "La Monarchie et la question du drapeau" (Paris, 1873); "La R&eacute;volution et l'orde chr&eacute;tien" (Paris, 1874); "L'Etat contre Dieu" (Paris, 1879); "Rome et la Papaut&eacute;" (Paris, 1883); and finally the works in historico-philosophic vein: "Etude sur Maine de Biran" (Paris, 1858); "Etude sur Eug&eacute;nie de Gu&eacute;rin" (Paris, 1863); "M&eacute;moires d'un p&egrave;re sur la vie et la mort de son fils" (Paris, 1869); "Etude historique et critique sur le P&egrave;re Lacordaire" (Toulouse, 1886).
