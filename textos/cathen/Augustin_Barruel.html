<h1>Augustin Barruel</h1>  

<p>Controversialist and publicist, born at Villeneuve de Berg (Ardeche); 2 October, 1741; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 5 October, 1820. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1756 and taught grammar at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in 1762. The storm against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> drove him from his country and he was occupied in college work in <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> until the suppression of the order in 1773. He then returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and his first literary work appeared in 1774: "Ode sur glorieux avenement de Louis Auguste au trone". That same year he became a collaborator of the "Ann&eacute;e litt&eacute;raire", edited by Fr&eacute;ron. His first important work was "Les Helveiennes, ou Lettres Provinciales philosophiques" (Amsterdam, 1781). The seventh edition of the work (Paris, 1839) contains a sketch of the author. Of these letters, the seventy-sixth is considered most brilliant. His book provoked a controversy with M. Giraud-Soulavie, and the replies and counter-replies were many.

<p>In the meantime, national affairs in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> were growing more and more turbulent, but Barruel continued his literary activity, which from now on occupied itself specially with public questions. In 1789 appeared "Lettres sur le Divorce", a refutation of a book by Hennet. From 1788 to 1792 he edited the famous "Journal Ecclesiastique" founded by Dinouart in 1760. In this periodical was published Barruel's "La Conduite du. S. Si&egrave;ge envers la France", a vigorous defense of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pope Pius VI</a>. He likewise wrote a number of pamphlets against the civil <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> demanded from <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and against the new civil constitution during 1790 and 1791. He afterward gathered into one "Collection Eccl&eacute;siastique" all the works relative to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and civil constitution. The ninth volume of this collection was published in 1793.

<p>The storm of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> had in the meantime (1792) forced Barruel to seek refuge in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he became almoner to the refugee Prince de Conti. Here he wrote in 1793 the well-known "Historie du Clerg&eacute; pendant la Revolution Francaise". He dedicated the work to the English nation in recognition of the hospitality it had shown toward the unfortunate <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. It has been translated into German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, and English. The English version went through several editions and did much to strengthen the British nation in its opposition to <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French revolutionary</a> principles. An American edition of the work appeared at <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a> in 1824. While in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, Barruel published an English work, "A Dissertation on Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in the Catholic Church" (1794). But none of his works attracted so much attention as his "M&eacute;moires pour servir &agrave; l'histoire du Jacobinisme" (London, 1797-98). It appeared in an English dress: "Memoirs of the History of Jacobinism and Freemasonry of Barruel, translated into English by the Hon. Robert Clifford" (London, 1798) in four volumes. This important work is an endeavor to account for the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> by a study of the anti-Christian and anti-social principles of the <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a> and the encyclopedic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. Owing to its translation into every modern language it was everywhere read and commented upon. A sharp criticism in the "Monthly Review" brought forth a reply from Barruel who greatly increased the circulation of his book by issuing an abridgement of it in 1798. The <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasons</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> angrily contested his assertions and a voluminous literature was the consequence. While some are of the opinion that Barruel's work attributes to the <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a> many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deeds for which they are not responsible, all admit that his exposition of their principals and the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> consequences flowing from them is the work of a powerful mind. Barruel, indeed, seems to have been the first to portray clearly the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequences to civil government, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to the social order that must result from the <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistic</a> oathbound associations that had acquired such tremendous power on the continent of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>On the fall of the Directory in 1802, Barruel was enabled to return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He fully accepted and persuaded many other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> to accept the new political order of things in his native country and he wrote several books to defend his opinions. When the Concordat was made in 1801 between <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, Barruel wrote: "Du Pape et de ses Droits Religieux". His last important controversy was his defense of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in its deposition of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, which had been necessitated by the new order of things in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, established by the Concordat. His book appeared also in English: "The Papal Power, or an historical essay on the temporal power of the Pope" (London, 1803). Many attacked the work, but as usual the author did not suffer an antagonist to go unanswered. His new work involved him in a very extended controversy, for his work was translated into all the principal <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages. His friends and foes alike became involved in a wordy <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Blanchard published in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> no less than three refutations. Two works are <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> attributed to Barruel: "L'Historie civile, politique et religieuse de Pie VI" and "D&eacute;couverte importante sur le syst&egrave;me de la Constitution du Clerg&eacute;, d&eacute;cr&eacute;t&eacute; par l'Assembl&eacute;e nationale". The many articles Barruel contributed to journals and his many published letters are not touched on here. He had promised to compose two works which never appeared, viz: "Historie des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s Secr&egrave;tes au Moyen-Age" and "Dissertation sur la Croisade contre les Albigeois". In regard to the latter work, Barruel stated his object would be to defend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the reproach of having deposed kings and having freed their subjects from the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance. He contended that objections on this score arose only from an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of history. During the whole course of a life of multiplied activity, Barruel was ever the wakeful <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> and unwearied defender of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. At the time of his death, he was engaged on a refutation of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system of <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, but never completed his work.
