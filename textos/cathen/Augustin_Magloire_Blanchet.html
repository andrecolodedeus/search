<h1>Augustin Magloire Blanchet</h1>  

<p>Brother of <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Fran&ccedil;ois Norbert Blanchet</a>, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Walla Walla-Nesqually, State of Washington, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> born 22 August, 1797, on his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> farm near the village of Saint-Pierre, Riviere du Sud, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; died 25 February, 1887, at Fort Vancouver, Washington. After attending the village <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for three years, he was sent to Quebec, with his brother Fran&ccedil;ois Norbert, to study for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 3 June, 1821. After a twelve-month as assistance <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at St. Gervais, he was sent as missionary to the Isles de la Madeleine and alter to Cape Breton Island. He gave four years of ministry to the Gulf provinces. Then he was recalled to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and was successively <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, in one of which he was the successor of his elder brother. In 1846 while a canon of the <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the new Diocese of Walla Walla in what is now the State of Washington. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 27 September, 1846. In the following spring he et out overland for his distant see with one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Rev. J.A.B. Brouillet, and two students. At Pittsburgh he declared his intention to become a citizen of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. At St. Louis the party was increased by Father Richard, two <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and Brother Blanchet, all members of the Order of Mary Immaculate. Fort Walla Walla was reached on 5 September, 1847. The Bishop located at The Dalles and thence multiplied his apostolic labours throughout the vast territory under his care. He endured the many hardships of a pioneer country and braved all the perils of a region infested with wild beasts and still more savage men. He was full of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. He established missions; he built churches; he founded academies and colleges; he started <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the Indians; he begged for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and abroad; he obtained sisters to open <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and other institutions. In 1850 the See of Walla Walla was suppressed and that of Nesqually was erected in its stead, with headquarters at Fort Vancouver. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> built there a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of logs, and a house for himself out of the same material. In 1852 he attended the First <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, but, on account of infirmities, he was unable to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. In 1879, after thirty-two years of arduous service in Washington, he resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and was named <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07615a.htm">Ibora</a>. Worn out with labours, he spent his last eight years in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and suffering. His peaceful death was a fitting close for his life of sacrifice. He is revered as the Apostle of Washington.
