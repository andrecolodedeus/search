<h1>Augustin Verot</h1>  

<p>Third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a>, first of St. Augustine, b. at <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, May, 1804; d. at St. Augustine, 10 June, 1876. He studied at St-Sulpice, Paris, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> de Quelen, 20 Sept., 1828, subsequently joined the Society of St-Sulpice, and in 1830 came to Baltimore. He taught <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11335c.htm">St. Mary's College</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> until 1853, when, being appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Ellicot's Mills, he continued four years in missionary activity. Nominated <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Florida, 11 Dec., 1857, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Danabe, 25 April, 1858, by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Religious conditions in <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>, owing chiefly to repeated mutations and instability in both civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> regimes, were disheartening. Unbounded <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and resourcefulness characterized Bishop Verot's administration from the beginning. The new vicariate had only three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He sought assistance in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and soon the churches at St. Augustine, Jacksonville, and Key West were repaired, new ones were erected at Tampa, Fernandina, Palatka, Mandarin, and Tallahassee and provided with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities were introduced, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> inaugurated. In July, 1861, Bishop Verot was translated to the <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">See of Savannah</a>, retaining meanwhile vicarial powers over Florida. Religion suffered enormously during the disastrous periods of the Civil War and the subsequent "reconstruction". The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> unfailing <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and energy inspired his afflicted people with patience and resolution in repairing the great losses they sustained in their religious and material interests. The Florida vicariate was constituted a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in March, 1870, and Bishop Verot became first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Augustine, concentrating henceforth all his efforts on the work begun there fourteen years previously. Contemporaneous files of the "Catholic Directory" disclose his just appraisal of the latent material resources of a then undeveloped region. Florida owes to Bishop Verot's initiative much of its present material as well as religious progress. He was amongst the first to advocate its claim as a health resort and its adaptability for the culture of products which have since become valuable. He made an annual <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">visitation</a> of the whole diocese, establishing churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at advantageous points, and aiming to lay a broad and solid foundation on which his successors might build. He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> to revive the memory of Florida's early <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. His numerous contributions on religious and historical themes in contemporary periodicals possess permanent value; his best-known writings are his "Pastoral on Slavery" and his "Catechism". He took a prominent part in the Councils of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">FLORIDA</a>).
