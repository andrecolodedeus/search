<h1>Augustin von Alfeld</h1>  

<p>(Alveldt, or Alveldianus)

<p>One of the earliest and most aggressive opponents of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, born in the village of Alfeld, near <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, from which he took his surname; died probably in 1532, Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of his parentage, youth, and early Franciscan of the Regular Observance, belonging to the Saxon Province of the Holy Cross. The Absence of his name on the matriculation rosters of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Erfurt, <a href="../cathen/13205b.htm">Rostock</a>, Leipzig, and <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, usually frequented by the members of the above-named province, leaves the presumption that he made his studies in one of the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. At the solicitation of Adolf of Anhalt, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Merseburg, in 1520 being already Lector of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> at <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> arena to controvert the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran heresy</a> (Mencken, Scriptores rer. Ger., II, 56). On 20 January, 1521 he presided at the public <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> disputation held at Weimar, between Lange, Mechler, and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, on the merit of <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and life (Kapp, Kleinere Nachlese n&uuml;tzlicher Urkunden zur Erl&auml;uterung der Reformationsgeschichte, II, 514, Leipzig, 1727), the result of which has not be handed down, though it called forth a satirical poem at the time (ib., 520). In 1523 he became Guardian of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Halle, in which position he is still found in 1528. In 1529 he was elected Provincial of the Saxon Province of the Holy Cross.

<p>Alfeld was a man of fine linguistic attainments, a fluent Latinist, familiar with the ancient classics, conversant with Greek and Hebrew, and well acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> writings of his day. His <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> was that of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">medieval scholasticism</a>, in which he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> "that the old <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> training did not leave the antagonists of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> helpless and unprepared in combating the novel, and to the theologically disciplined mind contradictory, assertions" (Otto, Johannes Cochl&aelig;us, 132, <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, 1874. As Lector of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, he devoted much attention and thought to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, so that he can state that "from my childhood I have devoted my time and life to it" (super apostolic&acirc; Sede, etc., iiia). In the textual studies of the Greek and Hebrew versions, the translation of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> writings of <a href="../cathen/09114b.htm">Faber Stapulensis (Lef&egrave;vre d'Etaples)</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13401c.htm">Complutensians</a>, he shows a keen, analytical mind and sound judgment. His memory and reputation, however, rest on his polemical activity and writings. The latter are marred at times by a tone of bitterness and sarcasm that detract from their intrinsic worth and gave his opponents, notably Lonicer, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> amanuensis (Biblia nova Alveldensis Wittenbergae Anno MDXX) opportunity to censure the catalogue epithets flung at <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> (Cyprian, N&uuml;tzliche Urkunden zur Erl&auml;uterung der Reformationsgeschichte, II, 158). If it be remembered that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> calls him <em>bos Lipsicus</em> (De Wette, Briife, Sendschreiben, etc., I, 446); <em>asinus</em> (op. cit., 451, 453, 533); <em>Lipsiensis asinus</em> (op. cit., 471, 475, 542), merely to single out a few controversial amenities, his literary style may be measurable condoned.
