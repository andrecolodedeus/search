<h1>Augustine Francis Hewit</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a> and second Superior General of the <a href="../cathen/10368c.htm">Institute of St. Paul the Apostle</a>; b. at Fairfield, Conn., <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> 27 November, 1820; d. in New York, 3 July, 1897. His father was Rev. Nathaniel Hewit, D.D., a prominent Congregationalist minister; and his mother, Rebecca Hillhouse Hewit, was a daughter of Hon. James Hillhouse, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Senator from <a href="../cathen/04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the Fairfield public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Phillips (Andover) Academy, and Amherst College, from which he was graduated in 1839. Although strictly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, his aversion to its peculiar <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> tenets prevented him from joining their Church until after his graduation from college, when, as he declares, he first learned that "a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may claim the privilege of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, if he is willing to acknowledge and ratify the covenant of which the sacrament is the sign and seal". Shortly after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> he began the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Congregationalist <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at East Windsor, Conn. Scarcely had he finished its prescribed course and been licensed to preach when he became convinced that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> is of Divine origin and he entered the Episcopal Church. The <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a> in that Church had already extended to America, and Hewit became one of its most ardent followers. He received the <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican order</a> of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in 1844, but with the expressed condition that he might interpret the Thirty-nine Articles in the sense of "Tract 90". The conversion of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> in 1845 gradually unsettled his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the validity of the claims of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicanism</a>, and he made his submission to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, 25 March, 1846. He then studied <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> privately under the direction of Dr. Patrick N. Lynch, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, S.C., and <a href="../cathen/04356b.htm">Dr. James A. Corcoran</a>, subsequently professor at Overbrook Seminary, Philadelphia. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on the first anniversary of his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by Right Rev. Ignatius A. Reynolds, D.D., <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>. He then became a teacher in a collegiate institute founded by <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Bishop England</a> at <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, and assisted Bishop Reynolds in the compilation of Bishop <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England's</a> works for publication. This occupation called him to Baltimore and Philadelphia, where he resided with <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Francis P. Kenrick</a> and became acquainted with the Venerable John Nepomucen Neumann, C.SS.R. [Editor's note: St. John N. Neumann was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Paul VI in 1977]. Here he was attracted to the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer</a>, which he entered in 1849. He made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> 28 Nov., 1850. As a <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> he laboured principally on missions with Fathers <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Isaac T. Hecker</a>, Clarence A. Walworth, <a href="../cathen/02213a.htm">Francis A. Baker</a>, and George Deshon, until with them he was dispensed from his religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Roman Congregation of Bishops and Regulars, 6 March, 1858. Under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker</a> all of these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> immediately formed the <a href="../cathen/10368c.htm">Institute of St. Paul the Apostle</a> in New York, with a rule enjoining poverty and obedience with the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Father Hewit, on account of his rare judgment, learning, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, was chosen to draft the first constitution and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of this new institute, which aims to satisfy the aspirations of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who desire to lead an apostolic and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in community without assuming the canonical responsibilities of the religious state, strictly so called. As a <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a>, Father Hewit laboured assiduously in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> and missionary fields and in the establishment and management of "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> World" magazine. He was a deep student of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, patristic literature, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, and Scripture, and taught all of these branches to the first <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> of the institute. He was also a prolific writer and for twenty years was one of the foremost <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apologists in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In this field he was chiefly noted for his loyalties to the magisterium of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and his agreement with the opinions of the most approved <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. He wrote nothing that could be styled original; he simply aimed to explain and popularize the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of Holy Church. Most of his articles were published in "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> World" and "The American Catholic Quarterly Review", and a few of them have reappeared in a volume entitled "Problems of the Age with Studies in St. Augustine on Kindred Topics". His most popular book was "The Life of Rev. Francis A. Baker", one of his companions, who died in 1865. "The King's Highway", which he wrote in 1874, is an excellent work to place in the hands of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who are seeking <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from Scripture. Upon the death of <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker</a> (1888), Father Hewit was almost unanimously chosen superior general of the institute and held this office until his death. One of his first acts as superior was to pledge the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a> community to support the Catholic University at Washington, D.C. St. Thomas College for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of candidates of the institute was accordingly opened in one of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> buildings in 1889. Under his direction, Rev. Walter Elliott, C.S.P., gave the first regular missions to non-Catholics in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and a new foundation of the institute was established in <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, Cal.
