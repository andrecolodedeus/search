<h1>Augustine Van De Vyver</h1>  

<p>Sixth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, Virginia; b. at Haesdonck, East <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 1 Dec., 1844; d. at <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, 16 Oct., 1911. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were John Ferdinand Van de Vyver and Sophia (De Schepper). He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the city of St. Nicholas, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and at the American College, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (1867-70). <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 24 July, 1870, he served successively as assistant at St. Peter's Cathedral, <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Harper's Ferry (1875-81), <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Diocese of Richmond</a> (1881-89). Assigned with him at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> for a time was the Rev. Dennis J. O'Connell, D.D., who was destined to be his successor in the <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">See of Richmond</a>. Father Van De Vyver's appointment by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to succeed Bishop Keane as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, 16 July, 1889, was furthered by a petition of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 20 October, 1889, having as consecrating <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> his two predecessors, His Eminence James Cardinal Gibbons and Bishop J.J. Keane (afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>), then <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Catholic University, Washington. During Bishop Van De Vyver's administration Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Fortune Ryan of New York donated the Sacred Heart Cathedral, the former the building, the latter the furnishings, at a cost of nearly a half million dollars. His Eminence, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> (then <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>) Diomede Falconio, laid the corner stone of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, 4 June, 1903, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the same, 29 November, 1906. In a quasi-synod held by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 12 November, 1907, new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were enacted to meet the needs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Guided by a spirit of deep <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, Bishop Van De Vyver made several ineffectual attempts to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The first, in 1903, and the second, in 1905, were frustrated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> authorities, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and people being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his intention. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> third and almost successful attempt to resign (1908) came to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the people, who held a great mass meeting of protest, their cause being materially aided by the public Press. The efforts of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> caused the final withdrawal of his resignation.

<p>In 1910 Bishop Van De Vyver acted as <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He had already made two "ad limina" visits to the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, one shortly after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the other in 1905. Among the later works which he inaugurated may be mentioned the erection of the McGill <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union and the <a href="../cathen/08670c.htm">Knights of Columbus</a> home. At his suggestion Mrs. and Mrs. Thomas F. Ryan gave to the diocese large sums for charitable, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, and other purposes of a religious nature. Mrs. Ryan has donated churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in various parts of the state. After a farewell visit to his relatives in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, followed by two weeks of illness on his return, and having calmly prepared himself by the reception of the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, Bishop Van De Vyver passed to his eternal reward. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a>, 20 October, on the 22nd anniversary of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. By his own request, the burial was in Mount Calvary Cemetery, <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, which he as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> had purchased. With the exception of Bishop McGill, he was the only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a> who died as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> there, the others having been transferred to other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. He was revered as a kind father and sympathetic friend, having a wide acquaintance amongst people of all ranks and <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>. His private life was simple, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and democratic. During his regime, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> made marked progress within the diocese. (See <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">DIOCESE OF RICHMOND</a>; <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">VIRGINIA</a>.)
