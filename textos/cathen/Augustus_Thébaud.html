<h1>Augustus Th&eacute;baud</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> educator and publicist, b. at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 20 Nov., 1807; d. at St. John's College, <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>, New York, 17 Dec., 1885. Father Th&eacute;baud was the son of a worthy but not wealthy merchant who was married to his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> wife in the dark days of the Terror by a loyal <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, a circumstance which eloquently proves their earnest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>. Their children were brought up with great care and given the best religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> which <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at that time afforded. Young Th&eacute;baud studied at first in the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, then entered the <em>grand s&eacute;minaire</em> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priesthood</a> at the usual age. After three years of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work in his native city, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, on 27 Nov., 1835, whence he returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1837 to pursue a course of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> under Amp&eacute;re and other distinguished professors. He landed in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> on 18 Dec., 1838, and was called to the chair of chemistry at <a href="../cathen/11335c.htm">St. Mary's College</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, where he became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> in 1846. Before the end of that year however the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> left Kentucky to take charge of St. John's College, <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>, New York, which had been transferred to them by Archbishop Hughes. Father Th&eacute;baud was the first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> President of St. John's, a position which he held from 1846 to 1851 and again from 1860 to 1863. In the interval he taught the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> for two years, 1851-52, under Father Larkin, and the following eight years he spent as the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Joseph's Church at Troy. To this charge he returned after his second rectorship at <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a> and filled the position from 1863-69, and again from 1873-74. The intervening years we find him at first in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and then at St. Joseph's Church, Hudson City, New Jersey. After spending another year at <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>, he was assigned to <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, New York, where he passed the rest of his days.

<p>Father Th&eacute;baud, who always had a strong literary bent, wrote a series of books on religious and historical subjects and published, besides numerous articles in the "Catholic World" and the "Catholic Quarterly Review", two novels, "Louisa Kirkbridge, A Tale of New York" (1879), and "Twit Twats, An Allegorical Story of Birds" (1881). His more important works are: "The Irish Race in the Past and in the Present" (1873); "The Church and the Gentile World" (2 vols., 1878); "The Church and the Moral World" (1881). From 1875 to his death, he also prepared his reminiscences in three volumes. Of these the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Historical Society published volume III (1904), giving an account of his American experiences, and volume I (1911), containing the recollections of his life in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Father Th&eacute;baud was a man full of energy, even in old age, an untiring student, and well-informed scholar. Withal he was a most agreeable companion, witty and full of life, and universally beloved by his friends and his pupils.
