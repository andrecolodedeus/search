<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin</h1>  

<p>Architect and archeologist, born in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 1 March, 1812; died at Ramsgate, 14 September, 1852; only child of Augustus Charles Pugin (originally de Pugin), a <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Protestant</a> of good <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, who had fled from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and settled in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> about 1798, and soon acquired distinction as a draughtsman in the office of John Nash, and as a teacher of <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> drawing. The young Pugin received his elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> as a day-boy at Christ's Hospital, better known as the Blue-coat School. At an early age he took his place among his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> pupils, and in 1825 he accompanied a party to Normandy for the study of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>. From his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> he inherited a surprising delicacy and dexterity in drawing and from his mother, Catherine Welby, some of that force of character and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which so distinguished him in after years. When fourteen he was entrusted with the responsibility of preparing drawings of Rochester Castle, and the year following, on occasion of his second visit to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, we find him suffering from overwork while sketching in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Notre Dame at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In the same year he was engaged to design furniture for Windsor Castle. In his youth a passion for theatrical accessories took possession of him. He fitted up a model stage with mechanical appliances of all kinds on the upper floor of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> house in Great Russell St.; he executed the scenery for the new ballet opera of "Kenilworth", which owed its success largely to the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> effects of his scenery; and subsequently he worked at the rearrangement of the stage machinery of Drury Lane. While still a delicate youth he became intensely fond of the sea, had a smack of his own, did some small trading in carrying woodcarvings from <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and was shipwrecked off Leith in 1830. This <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the sea was strong in him to the end of his life.

<p>In 1831 he married Ann Garnett, and shortly afterwards was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for non-payment of rent. He then opened a shop in Hart Street, Covent Gardens, for the supply of architects' drawings and <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> accessories. The venture, however, did not succeed. His wife died in childbirth 27 May, 1832. In 1833 he married Louisa Burton who bore him six children, among whom were the two who successively carried on his business, the eldest, Edward (d. 1875) and the youngest, Peter Paul (d. 1904). Both received from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the decoration of the Order of St. Sylvester. After his second marriage he took up his residence at <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, and in 1834 embraced the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, his wife following his example in 1839. Of his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> he tells us that the study of ancient <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">ecclesiastical architecture</a> was the primary cause of the change in his sentiments, by inducing him to pursue a course of study, terminating in complete conversion. He never swerved in his fidelity to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, notwithstanding the bitter trials he experienced. he found that he had exchanged the noble <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> with their service of chant for Moorfield <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> with its maimed rites.

<p>In 1835 he bought a small plot of ground at Laverstock, near <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, on which he built for himself a quaint fifteenth-century house, St. Marie's Grange. In 1837 he made the acquaintance of the authorities of St. Mary's College, Oscott, where his fame as a write had preceded him. He found there men in sympathy with his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> about art and religion. The president, <a href="../cathen/15575a.htm">Rev. Henry Weedall</a>, was so impressed by him, that he accepted his services for the completion of the new <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and for the decorations of the new college, which was opened in 1838. He designed the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> with its effective groinings, the <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> windows, the decorated ceiling, the stone <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, and the splendid Gothic vestments. He constructed the reredos of old wood-carvings brought from the Continent, he placed the Limoges enamels on the front of the super-altar, he provided the seventeenth-century confessional, <a href="../cathen/01356c.htm">altar rails</a>, and stalls, the carved <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> (from St. Gertrude's, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>), the finest in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, as well as the ambries and chests of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> (see "The Oscotian", July, 1905). He built both lodges and added the turret called "Pugin's night-cap" to the tower. Above all he inspired superiors and students with an ardent enthusiasm for his ideals in Gothic art, liturgy, and the sacred chant. Tradition points out the room in which on Saturday afternoons he used to instruct the workmen from Hardman's, <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, in the spirit and technic of their craft. The president appointed him professor of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> antiquities (1838-44). While at the "Old College" he gave his lectures in what is now the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans'</a> dining-room, and at the new college in a room which still bears in the inscription "Architectura". This association with one of the leading <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> afforded him valuable opportunities for the advancement of his views. During this period he did much of his best work in writing, teaching, and structural design. Although at different times he had visited Frances and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> either alone, or in the company of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> of the Earl of <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, he did not visit the great cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> until 1847. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> sorely disappointed him; but he had his compensation in the gift from <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> of a splendid gold medal as a token of approval, which gratified Pugin more than any event in his life. His second wife having died in 1844, he married in 1848 Jane, daughter of Thomas Knill of Typtree Hall, Herefordshire, by whom he had two children. In the meantime he had removed from Laverstock, and after a temporary residence at Cheyne Walk, Chelsea (1841), he took up his residence at Ramsgate, living first with his aunt, Miss Selina Welby, who made him her heir, and then in the house called St. Augustine's Grange, which, together with a church, he had built for himself. Of these he said that they were the only buildings in which his designs had not been curtailed by financial conditions.



<p>Under a presentiment of approaching death, of which he had an unusual fear, he went into retreat in 1851, and prepared himself by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and self-dential for the end. At the close of the year his mind became affected and early in 1852 he was placed in the asylum commonly called Bedlam, in St. George's Fields, Lambeth. At the urgent request of his wife and in opposition to the wishes of the rest of his friends, he was removed from the asylum, first to the Grove, Hammersmith, where after six weeks' care his condition had improved to such an extent that it was possible for him to return to Ramsgate; but two days after he reached home he had a fatal stroke.

<p>Pugin was somewhat below the middle stature and rather thick-set, with long dark hair and grey eyes that seemed to take in everything. He usually wore a sailor's jacket, loose pilot trousers, a low-crowned hat, a black silk handkerchief thrown negligently round his neck, and shapeless footwear carelessly tied. His form and attire suggested the seaman rather than a man of art. A voluble talker both at work and at table, he possessed a fund of anecdote and a great power of dramatic presentation; and when in good health overflowed with energy and good humour. And if sometimes his language was vigorous or personal, he was generous and never vindictive. Inured to industry from childhood, as a man he would work from sunrise to midnight with extraordinary ease and rapidity. His short thick hands, his stumpy tapering fingers, with the aid of a short pencil, a paid of compasses and a carpenter's rule, performed their delicate work even under such unfavourable circumstances as sailing his lugger off the South Coast. Most of his <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> work he entrusted to an enthusiastic builder whom he had known as a workingman at <a href="../cathen/02540b.htm">Beverley</a>. He trained the workmen he employed, and was in turn idolized by them. In his home at Ramsgate he lived with the regularity and abstemiousness of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> eagerness of a student. His benevolence made him everywhere the father of the poor.

<p>His life was a battle for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and fitness in architecture. He fought for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> inspiration of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medievalism</a> as against the cold <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> of the classic style. The victory ultimately fell to his side. The Englishman of today can with difficulty realize the condition of bad taste and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which prevailed in matters of art at the commencement of the nineteenth century. "When Welby Pugin began his labours," says Ferrey, "there was not a single building of modern date, either public or private, which was not a reproach and a disgrace to the country." And although not alone, still more than any other man Pugin worked for a restoration. He revealed the principles of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> builder and the enlightened skill of their craftsmen. Others have since applied his principles. The occasional exaggeration or narrowness of his views has been corrected or avoided; and it remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the restoration of our ancient churches, as well as the varied beauty of many of our new structures, is due to the ability and unconquerable energy of Pugin. He was the man for his time. Gothic art was being studied, and many were turning their thoughts to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> out of which it had sprung. Still, prejudice had to be broken down and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> removed; but the spirit of Pugin triumphed in the end.

<p>Much discussion has arise concerning the claims of Pugin to the credit of having designed the Houses of Parliament at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a>. The old Palace of Westminster had been destroyed by fire in 1834; plans for the new buildings were invited, and those of Charles Barry (afterwards Sir Charles) received the approval of the Commissioners from among some eighty-four competitors. The first stone of the new erection was laid in 1840 and the queen formally opened the two houses in 1852. At the outset Barry called in Pugin (1836-37) to complete his half-drawn plans, and he further entrusted to him the working plans and the entire decoration (1837-52). Pugin's own statement on the subject is decisive: "Barry's great work", he said, "was immeasurably superior to any that I could at the time have produced, and had it been otherwise, the commissioners would have killed me in a twelve-month" (i.e. by their opposition and interference).
<h2>Literary work</h2>

<p>The influence he wielded must be ascribed as much to his vigorous writings and exquisite designs as to any particular edifice which he erected. His "Contracts (1836) placed him at once ahead of the pioneers of the day. His "Glossary" (1844), so brilliant a revival in form and colour, produced nothing short of a revolution in church decoration. Scarcely less important were his designs for "Furniture" (1835), for "Iron and Brass Work" (1836), and for "Gold and Silver-Smiths" (1836) to which should be added his "Ancient Timber Houses of the XVth and XVIth Centuries" (1836), and his latest <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> work on "Chancel Screens and Rood Lofts" (1851). Besides the above elaborately illustrated productions, many other explanatory and apologetical writings, especially his lectures delivered at Oscott (see "Catholic Magazine", 1838, April and foll.) gave powerful expression to the message he had to deliver. As closely allied with his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the restoration of constructive and decorative art, he brought out a pamphlet on the chant: "An Earnest Appeal for the Revival of the Ancient Plain Song" (1850). It is worthy of mention that some of his earliest drawing appears in the volumes published by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> ("Examples of Gothic Architecture", 1821, 226 plates; "Architectural Antiquities of Normandy", 1828, 80 plates; "Gothic Ornaments, England and France", 1831, 91 plates). In <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> architecture and in his insight into its spirit and form, he stood above all his contemporaries. As a draughtsman he was without a rival. The success of his career is to be sought not so much in the buildings he erected, which, being mostly for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body, were nearly always shorn of their chief splendour by the poverty of his patrons. He invented now new forms of design, though he freely used the old; his <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> led him to Art as such, but to the Gothic embodiment of Art, which seemed to him the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> form of <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">Christian architecture</a>. He lacked the patience and breadth of the truly great mind, yet he may justly claim to rank as the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> genius of the century. His unquestioned merit is the restoration of architecture in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the revival of the forms of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, which since his day have covered the land. Queen Victoria granted his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> a pension of 100 pounds a year, and a committee of all parties founded the Pugin Travelling Scholarship (controlled by the Royal Institute of British Architects) as the most appropriate memorial of his work and a partial realization of the project which he had brought forward in his "Apology for the Revival of Christian Architecture in England" (1843).
