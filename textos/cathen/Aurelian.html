<h1>Aurelian</h1>  

<p>(Lucius Dominius Aurelianus).

<p>Roman Emperor, 270-275, born of humble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, near <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> in Pannonia, 9 September, 214; died 275.

<p>At the age of twenty he entered the military service, in which, because of exceptional ability and remarkable bodily strength his advancement was rapid. On the death of Claudius he was proclaimed Emperor by the army at <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, and became sole master of the Roman dominions on the <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> of his rival Quintillus, the candidate of the Senate. When Aurelian assumed the reins government the Roman world was divided three sections: the Gallo-Roman Empire, established by Postumus, comprising Gaul and Britain; the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/11433a.htm">Palmyra</a>, which held sway over the entire Orient, including <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the greater part of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and the Roman Empire, restricted to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, the Danubian Provinces of Africa, convoked and presided at the Greece, and Bithynia. On the upper Danube, Rhaetia and Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were overrun by the Juthungi, while the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> were preparing to invade Pannonia. The internal affairs of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> mere equally deplorable. The <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> of the legions and the frequent revolutions in preceding reigns had shattered the imperial authority; the treasury was empty and the monetary system ruined. With no support but that afforded by the army of the Danube, Aurelian undertook to restore the material and moral unity of the Empire; and to introduce whatever reforms were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give it stability. Enormous as this project was, in the face of so many obstacles, he succeeded in accomplishing it in less than five years. When he died, the frontiers were all restored and strongly defended, the unity of the Empire was established, the administration was reorganized, the finances of the Empire placed on a sound footing, and the monetary system thoroughly revised.

<p>His scheme for the complete unification of the Empire led him to attempt to establish the worship of the sun as the supreme god of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. During the early years of his reign Aurelian exhibited remarkable <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and tolerance towards the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In 272, when he had gained possession of Antioch, after defeating Zenobia in several battles, he was appealed to by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to decide whether the "Church building" in Antioch belonged to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Domnus, or to the party represented by the favourite of Zenobia, <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>, who had been deposed for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held three or four years before. His decision, based probably on the Edict of <a href="../cathen/06366a.htm">Gallienus</a>, was that the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belonged to those who were in union with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.27-30</a>). As this act was based on political motives, it cannot be construed into one of friendliness for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. As soon as he was at liberty to carry out his schemes for internal reform Aurelian revived the polity of his predecessor <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a>, threatened to rescind the Edict of <a href="../cathen/06366a.htm">Gallienus</a>, and commenced a systematic <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the followers of Christ. The exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the inauguration of this policy is not known. It is summer of 275 and despatched to the governors of the provinces, but Aurelian was slain before he could put it into execution. Tradition refers to his reign a large number of <em>Acta Martyrum</em>, none of which is considered to be authentic (Dom Butler, "Journal of Theological Studies", 1906, VII, 306). His biographer Vopiscus, says (c. xx) that he once reproached the Roman Senate for neglecting to consult the Sibylline Books in an hour of imminent peril. "It would seem", he said, "as if you were holding your meetings in a church of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> instead of in a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of all the gods"; from which statement it has been rightly inferred that "the decline of the old <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the progress of the new, and that the buildings then used for the <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worship of the Christians</a> were becoming more and more conspicuous".
