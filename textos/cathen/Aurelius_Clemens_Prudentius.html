<h1>Aurelius Clemens Prudentius</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poet, born in the Tarraconensis, Northern <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 348; died probably in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, after 405. He must have been born a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, for he nowhere speaks of his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. The place of his birth is uncertain; it may have been Saragossa, <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, or Calahorra. He practised law with some success, and in later life deplored the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he had devoted to his profession. He was twice provincial governor, perhaps in his native country, before the emperor summoned him to court. Towards the end of his life Prudentius renounced the vanities of the world to practise a rigorous asceticism, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> until evening (Cath., iii, 88) and abstaining entirely from animal food (ibid., 56). The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poems were written during this period; he later collected them and wrote a preface, which he himself <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 405. A little before (perhaps in 403) he had to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, doubtless to make some appeal to the emperor. A number of his poems (Peristephanon, vii, ix, xi, xii, xiv) were written subsequently to this journey, of which he took advantage to visit the sanctuaries and <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. "Contra Symmachum" must have been written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the second book belongs to the period between 29 March and December, 403. All other works antedate the journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Prudentius wrote to glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and atone for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. His works fall into three groups: lyrical, didactic, and polemical. The lyrics form two collections. In the "Cathemerinon" the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> are for the sanctification of the hours of the day or certain important occasions, such as <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, the Epiphany, obsequies, etc. Some continue the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> tradition of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Saint Ambrose</a>, and are written in the Ambrosian iambic dimeter; others are an attempt to enlist the metres of Horace in the service of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> lyrical poetry. Despite his negligence Prudentius displays more art than Ambrose. Hymn xii, on the feast of the Epiphany, contains the two celebrated stanzas, "Saluete flores martyrum", characterized by profound feeling united to the purest art; <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> x on burial is likewise very remarkable. However, his style is generally diffuse, and the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> admitted to the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> had to be curtailed. The "Peristephanon" is dedicated to the glory of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>: Emeterius and Chelidonius of Calahorra, Lawrence the Deacon, Eulalia, the eighteen <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Saragossa, Vincent, Fructuosus with Augurius and Eulogius, Quirinus of Siscia, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Calahorra <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> on the site of the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>, Cassianus of the Forum Cornelium, Romanus, <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, Peter and Paul, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, and Agnes. Taken altogether, it is an endeavour to endow <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with a lyrical poetry independent of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> uses and traditions. Unfortunately, neither Prudentius's talent nor current taste favoured such an enterprise. The narratives are spoiled with too much rhetoric. There are, however, beautiful passages, a kind of grave power, and some pretty details, as in the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> on St. Eulalia (see v. 206-15) and St. Agnes. Certain others, such as that on <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a>, have an arch&aelig;ological interest. The whole collection is curious, but of unequal merit.

<p>The two principal didactic poems are the "Apotheosis", on the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Trinity, and the "Hamartigenia", on the origin of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. One is somewhat astonished to find Prudentius attacking ancient <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, such as those of Sabellius and Marcian, and having nothing to say on <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. It is due to the fact that he closely follows and imitates <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, whose rugged genius resembles his own. These poems are interesting examples of passionate, glowing abstractions, precise exposition being combined with poetic fantasy. Some brilliant scenes, like the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> (Apoth., 460), merit quotation. The comparison of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> led astray by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with doves caught in snares (Ham., 779) has a charm that recalls the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> inspiration of "Saluete flores". Orthodoxy is his great preoccupation in these poems, and he invokes all kinds of punishments on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Yet he is not always free from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, here or elsewhere. He believes that only a small number of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are lost (Cath., vi, 95). It is an exaggeration of the meaning of his metaphors to assert that he makes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> material. The "Psychomachia "is the model of a style destined to be lovingly cultivated in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, i.e., allegorical poetry, of which before Prudentius only the merest traces are found (in such authors as Apuleius, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, and Claudian). In <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> "De Spectaculis", 29, we find its first conception; he personifies the vices and the virtues and shows them contending for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The army of vices is that of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, the army of the virtues that of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The poem is, therefore, at once moral and apologetic. It would be difficult to imagine anything more unfortunate or insupportable. Incidents, action, and characters of the &AElig;neid are here travestied, and the deplorable effect is heightened by the borrowing of numerous hemistichs divested of their proper meaning. The "Dittoch&aelig;on", forty-nine hexameter tetrastichs commenting on various events of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, must be included among the didactic poems of Prudentius. <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">Doubts</a> have been raised regarding the authenticity of these verses but with very little reason. <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a> (De viris illustr., xiii) furthermore attributes to Prudentius, mistakenly perhaps, a "Hexaemeron" of which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing.

<p>His most personal work is the invective against Symmachus. It shows how the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> reconciled their patriotism with their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Prudentius identifies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and, in thus transforming it, preserves that ancient <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the city. He can be impartial towards the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and praise him for services rendered the State. He is proud of the senate, seeing its majority <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is come to crown the Roman institutions. Romans are superior to the barbarians, as man is superior to the animals. These two books against Symmachus undertake, therefore, to solve the problem which presented itself to the mind of the still hesitant <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>. A genius more powerful than pliant, Prudentius displays a more versatile and richer talent than that of his <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> contemporary, Claudian. The rhetoric he disparages, he himself misuses; he often exaggerates, but is never commonplace. The superior of many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> poets, among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> he is the greatest and the most truly poetic. His style is not bad considering the period in which he wrote, and, while there are occasional <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in his prosody due to the pronunciation then current, he shows himself a careful versifier and has the gift (then become rare) of varying his metres. An edition of Prudentius is to appear in the "Corpus" of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, edited by J. Bergman. The best <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Latin department, 8084; on one of its margins is the half-effaced name of Vettius Agorius Basilius Mavortius (consul in 527), who made a recension of the works of Horace. This <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is free from the dogmatic corrections which are found in others.
