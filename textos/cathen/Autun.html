<h1>Autun</h1>  

<h2>The diocese of Autun</h2>

<p>(Augustodonum).

<p>Comprises the entire Department of Saone et Loire in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. It was suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Archdiocese of Lyons</a> under the old regime. The sees of Chalons-sur-Saone and M&acirc;con were united to Autun after the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, and it then became suffragan to <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> (1802), afterwards to Lyons (1822). <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> reached Autun at a very early period, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the famous Greek inscription of Pectorius which dates from the third century. It was found in 1839 in the cemetery of St. Peter l'Estrier at Autun and bears testimony to the antiquity and efficacy of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the sacramental words of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. Local recensions of the "Passion" of St. Symphorianus of Autun exhibit <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a> on the eve of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a>, assigning to St. Iren&aelig;us two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> (Sts. Benignus, Andochius, and Thyrsus), all three of whom depart for Autun. St. Benigus goes on to <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, while the others remain at Autun. According to this legendary cycle, which dates from about the first half of the sixth century it was not then believed at Autun that the city was an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> (c. 140-211). St. Amator, whom Autun tradition designates as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, probably occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> about 250. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> known to history is St. Reticius, an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer, and contemporary of the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> (306-337). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Autun enjoys the right of wearing the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, in virtue of a privilege accorded to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 599 by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (590-604). In the Merovingian period two Bishops of Autun figured prominently in political affairs; St. Syagrius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> during the second half of the sixth century, a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (a native of Autun), and St. Leodegarius (L&eacute;ger), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 663 to 680, celebrated on account of his conflict with Ebroin and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by order of Thierry III. Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P&eacute;rigord, the future diplomat, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Autun from 1788 to 1790, when he resigned. The last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this see appointed in 1882 (d. 1906), was Cardinal Perraud, member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>. In 670, an important council was held at Autun for the purpose of regulating the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Autun dates from the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and was formerly the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Dukes of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; their palace was the actual episcopal residence. In the Diocese of Autun are yet to be seen the ruins of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Tournus and the great Abbey of Cluny, to which 2,000 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were subject, and which gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the great <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (1073-85). Gelasius II (1118-19) died at Cluny, and there also was held the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> that elected <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Calixtus II</a> (1119-24). The devotion to the Sacred Heart originated in the Visitation Convent at Paray-le Monial, founded in 1644, and now the object of frequent <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>. At the end of the year 1905 the Diocese of Autun contained 618,227 inhabitants, 65 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 458 succursal, or auxiliary, churches and 68 vicariates.
<h2>The councils of Autun</h2>

<p>The first council, held in 663 (or 670) orders all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to learn by heart the Apostles Creed and the <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Athanasian Creed</a>, and this seems to be the earliest mention of the latter in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Cardinal Pitra says in his "Histoire de St. L&eacute;ger" that this canon may have been directed against <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>, then seeking entrance into the Gallican churches, but condemned beforehand in the latter of these creeds. The <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> was also prescribed as the normal monastic code. In the Council of 1065, Saint Hugues, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, accomplished the reconciliation of Robert, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Autun. In 1077 Hugues, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Di&eacute;, held a council at Autun, by order of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">St. Gregory VII</a>; it deposed Manasses, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, for <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and usurpation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and reproved other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for absence from the council. In 1094 Hugues, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and thirty-three other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> renewed at Autun the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Antipope Guibert</a>, and their partisans, also that of King Philip of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, guilty of bigamy. <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">Simony</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> disorders, and monastic usurpations provoked other decrees, only one of which is extant, forbidding the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to induce the canons to enter <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.
