<h1>Auxiliary Bishop</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> deputed to a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> who, capable of governing and administering his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, is unable to perform the pontifical functions; or whose <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is so extensive that it requires the labors of more than one; or whose <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> has attached to it a royal or imperial office requiring protracted presence at court. According to the present <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without title to a certain and distinct diocese which he governs either actually or potentially. Actual government requires residence, potential does not. Hence, there are two principal classes of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the residential, or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> or, local, or ordinary; and the non-residential, or titular. Diocesan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have and exercise <em>(de jure) </em>full power of order and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, in and over the diocese committed to their exclusive care by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Titulars, as such, have not, and do not exercise, power of order and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, in and over their <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular sees</a>. All actual <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular sees</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> reserves to himself, and exercises through the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> is ordinary. Should a titular perform a jurisdictional function, he uses delegated <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.

<p>Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are those who have been appointed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to a see or diocese which, in former times, had been canonically established and possessed <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, but at present, on account of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> occupation and government, has neither <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> nor people. It is essential that the titular diocese did once exist, and did cease to exist through death or defection of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and faithful, or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> settlement and government. No vestige of titulars, as defined, appears until the close of the thirteenth century. Evidently the host of wandering <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> without title or see &#151; missionary, regional, or exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> &#151; of whom historians make mention, cannot be classed with our titulars, who did not come into existence until the greater part of the East had passed under <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rule, and the destruction or defection of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian flock</a> and the death of their shepherds ensued. The episcopal succession in those <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> was maintained as long as a hope remained of their rehabilitation, and their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were hospitably received, and frequently used by the diocesans as auxiliaries or vicars, in pontificals in their respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Ecclesiastical authority placed some of them in temporary charge of vacant Western <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, on condition of their immediate return to their own sees when possible. Others were given the spiritual care of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> by civil princes who, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avaricious</a> of the episcopal revenues, prevented the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the fourteenth century, the great number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> without occupation, and their invasion of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of the diocesans brought about <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> legislation. <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (I, iii de elect. V, Clem.) prohibited the election and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of any cleric, without <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> license, to any of those vacant sees <em>(sine clero populoque).</em> The first mention of <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> occurs in the Lateran <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (sess. 9 de Cardinalibus), wherein <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> permits the creation of titulars whom the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a> may use as suffragans, or auxiliaries, in their respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Afterwards, the privilege was extended for various reasons, principal among which were <ul> <li>to preserve from oblivion the memory of those once venerable and important, but now desolate, sees; <li>that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> might have at hand efficient and capable assistants (without care of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>) in the discharge of the numerous and important <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the Apostolic ministry in and outside of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>; <li>that suffragans might be given to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> impeded by reason of infirmity, partial or entire, or of the great extent of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, or legitimate and protracted absence from performing their episcopal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. </ul> <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, decreed that suffragans were not to be given unless to <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and to those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to whom it was customary to grant them, and who guaranteed a fixed salary to support the dignity of the auxiliary. He also decreed that such auxiliary should not, without <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> permission, exercise the pontifical functions in any other diocese, save in that of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> to whom he had been given. Gradually it was extended to other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had solid reasons for assistance. The appointment of all titulars belongs exclusively to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (Clement, <em>ut supra</em>). Present usage requires an auxiliary, suffragan, and temporary coadjutor (used indiscriminately to mean almost the same office) to be also a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, yet the former antedate the latter by many centuries. They come down to us from Apostolic times; thus <a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a> and Cletus were vicars, or auxiliaries, to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; Ammianus [Anianus], to <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">St. Mark</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>; <a href="../cathen/01285b.htm">Alexander</a>, to Narcissus (aged 116 years) of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory the Theologian</a>, auxiliary in pontificals to St. Gregory, Bishop of Nazianzus; <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, coadjutor of Valerius of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>; so likewise those of the rural <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (<a href="../cathen/16024c.htm"><em>chorepiscopi</em></a>), who had received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> (there were many in the Orient from the third to the seventh, and, in the West, from the eighth to the tenth, centuries), and many exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, then in the West were auxiliaries to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> even up to the <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clementine</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.



<p>Though the terms <em>auxiliary, suffragan</em>, and <em>coadjutor</em> are used indiscriminately, yet there is a difference. Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is as defined at the beginning of this article. Suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the name given to the auxiliaries of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia and Velletri</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Sabina. Coadjutors are given to diocesans impeded from performance of their episcopal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> by old age, or bodily infirmity, or sickness, protracted and incurable, such as loss of speech, blindness, paralysis, and insanity. A coadjutor to an insane <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has full <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and can exercise all episcopal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, with the sole exception of disposing of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical properties</a>. There are coadjutors in temporals, or in spirituals, or in both temporals and spirituals. The first kind need not be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> suffices. Coadjutors are also temporary and perpetual; the first has no succession, the latter has, and is called coadjutor with right of succession. Coadjutors with right of succession rarely are granted, and only when urgent necessity and an evident utility are superadded to the above reasons; and then they must be made known to, and approved as such, by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It is not the practice to force a perpetual coadjutor upon an unwilling <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> can do so. Such perpetual coadjutor cannot mix in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration, nor do aught but as he is told or permitted by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. Some of the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> [I] proposed that, in the future, <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a> should be appointed instead of perpetual coadjutors. A coadjutor is granted to aid a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> in order and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> as far as is needed; the auxiliary is deputed to aid only in function of order. He may be made <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and then, by virtue of that office, he has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>. Since auxiliarship, or temporary coadjutorship, is neither a title nor prelature, but an office, it is temporary, and ceases at the death, or suspension, or resignation, of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, for valid reasons, in the fifteenth century established permanent auxiliarships in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (16 July, 1821, Constit. De salute animar.) confirmed such offices in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, etc. In these countries the office of auxiliary does not die with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, but continues under his successors. The auxiliary, <em>sede vacante, </em>however, cannot perform functions strictly episcopal. Successors to such auxiliaries are not given the same, but an entirely different, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>. Perpetual coadjutorship is irrevocable, and its holder succeeds immediately to the vacant see; no further collation or election is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Office of auxiliary, etc. is revocable at will of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>; that of the perpetual coadjutor cannot be taken away unless for canonical causes. Auxiliaries and temporary coadjutors are appointed by the Holy Father at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in need of assistance. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (on petition of the Sacred Congregation of the Council, or of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>) as a rule appoints the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> named by orator. The election or <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> for perpetual coadjutors is governed by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for election or <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> <em>(sede vacante) </em>of a new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. The same disposition of mind and body is required for auxiliary, etc. as for <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. They must be thirty years complete, and have spent six months in Sacred Orders prior to elevation to the episcopate, yet in the case of the auxiliaries, the most worthy has no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the merely worthy. For perpetual coadjutorship most worthy is demanded.

<p>Rights and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of auxiliaries must be considered from a twofold standpoint: i.e. titulars of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and auxiliaries of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. By right of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> a titular auxiliary can validly, but not licitly, without permission of the residential, perform all the functions annexed to the episcopal order by Divine and ecclesiastical law. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could, but does not, require the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan's</a> permission, for the validity of the latter functions. Having no actual <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, he cannot without express consent and permission of the ordinary perform pontifical functions in the city or diocese, nor can he do so, <em>sede vacante, </em>even with the permission of the chapter. Possessing only potential <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in his <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>, he cannot <ul> <li>hear, or grant faculties to hear, confession of a visiting subject from his <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>; <li>confirm or ordain him; <li>send a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to preach, or to perform any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions, in his <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>; <li>absolve, or grant faculty to a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to absolve, a member of his own household; <li>assist at the marriage of a titular subject, a visitor where the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> holds; <li>ordain his familiar of three years' standing, nor grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. </ul> Should at any time <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or Laity sufficiently numerous be found in his titular diocese, and no representative of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> have supervision over it, he can immediately, without any other collation of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, take possession of his titular church. He then ceases to be titular and becomes <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">diocesan</a>. He may, and according to some must, be invited to General Councils, and once there he has decisive vote. A few were present at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and quite a number at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> [I]. Although he has not the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to take part in Provincial Councils, he may be invited to do so, but has no decisive vote, unless by unanimous consent and permission of the Provincial Fathers. He can wear everywhere the <a href="../cathen/12231b.htm">prelatial dress</a> and ring (the sign of his spiritual union with his <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>), and use the <a href="../cathen/12231b.htm">pontifical vestments, ornaments, and insignia</a>, when, by permission of the ordinary, he performs pontifical functions. In <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a> and every meeting of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> where the local <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> is not present, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the titular auxiliary, etc., takes precedence of all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (except assistant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at pontifical throne) of later <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. In provincial councils, however, all suffragans outrank all titulars without regard to date of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Titular auxiliaries, as well as diocesans, are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to receive episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> within three months from confirmation, unless this is morally impossible; to make profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and take <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of loyalty and fidelity to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>, and to go to his titular diocese, if ever it is rehabilitated. By reason of the spiritual union with his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, he cannot be elected, but only postulated, for another diocese. Only the Holy Father can dissolve the spiritual union with the <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>. An auxiliary never has the title of a titular <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>: but a perpetual coadjutor often has. The titular archbishop-coadjutor is not bound to petition for the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> or the use of it. Titular auxiliary is not bound <ul> <li>to make visit <em>ad limina Apostolorum </em>(some say he is); <li>to residence in his <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>, or in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in which he holds the office of auxiliary (the place of his residence is regulated by the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">diocesan</a>); <li>to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> "for the people."</ul>

<p>The criminal and important causes relating to auxiliary bishops are reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, those of lesser moment to the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars. By virtue of the office of auxiliary he has a perpetual right to a pension suitable to maintain the episcopal dignity. This is to be paid by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> revenues. The amount of pension and source from which it is to be obtained is generally specified in the Apostolic Letters of appointment. He can hold any <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> he had before and acquire a new one after his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, as the office of auxiliary is not a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. He enjoys the same honorific privileges (with a few exceptions, viz. throne, cappa magna, mozzetta, and <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> worn without <a href="../cathen/09611a.htm">mantelletta</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>), pontifical ornaments, and titles, as does the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. He can and must use the prelatial dress, as in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, to wit: <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> over the purple soutane with purple <a href="../cathen/09611a.htm">mantelletta</a>, in his attendance in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, where he has precedence over all other canons and dignitaries, as to choir stall and functions. When he is celebrant in pontifical functions, the canons must assist, but in the usual canonical dress, except <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> in <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a>. Not all the canons are bound to meet him at the church door, as he enters to celebrate <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> he is assisted by a canon as assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and sub-deacon in <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a>. He has no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the usual two canon-assistant <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, nor to the seventh candlestick, nor to the usual reverences of the canons at Kyrie, etc., nor the use of the throne or <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> unless by special permission. He uses the faldistorium. He can use the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> with the special permission of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, and when he officiates at ordinations, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrations</a>, and other pontifical functions, during which the rules of the Pontifical demand its use (Caeremon. Epis., I, xvii; Decret. Bracharen. Sept. 1607). It is proper, however, that he impart the episcopal last blessing. He cannot <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> publicly the people as he wends his way through the city. It is forbidden him to make visitation of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> without express permission and command of the local <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. Canons are bound to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> the auxiliary's hand when he gives them <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>, and assist him in consecrating Holy Oils, conferring <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>, and in all sacred functions strictly episcopal, which he performs for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. If he be a canon, he is subject, as the other <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons, to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> law and the penalties attached to its violation. If the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and the auxiliary assist simultaneously at Mass, the sub-deacon must not give the latter the pax before the canon-assistants at the throne have received it from the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">bishop ordinary</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> assists at Mass, or <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, the auxiliary must leave his stall and join the other canons in making the prescribed reverences before the Kyrie, Gloria, etc. Should the celebrant be the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, assisted by the chapter in <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a>, the auxiliary can wear a cope and a linen <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> (with consent of the local), which latter he must take off and put on by himself. It is expedient that he substitute another in his turn for the Missa Cantata, as he cannot use a faldistorium and pontifical vestments without consent of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>.
