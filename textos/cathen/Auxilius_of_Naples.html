<h1>Auxilius of Naples</h1>  

<p>The name (probably fictitious, according to Hefele) of an ecclesiastic to whom we owe a series of remarkable writings (P.L., CXXIX, 1054 sqq.) that deal with the controversies concerning the succession and fate of Pope Formosus (891-896), and especially the validity of the orders conferred by him. Auxilius was a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frank</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or perhaps only a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Formosus, and lived later in lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, apparently at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. On the death of Pope Formosus there began for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> a time of the deepest humiliation, such as it has never experienced before or since. After the successor of Formosus, <a href="../cathen/02661b.htm">Boniface VI</a>, had ruled only fifteen days, Stephen VI (properly VII), one of the adherents of the party of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, was raised to the Papal Chair. In his blind rage, Stephen not only abused the memory of Formosus but also treated his body with indignity. Stephen was strangled in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in the summer of 897, and the six following <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (to May, 1904) owed their elevation to the struggles of the political parties. Christophorus, the last of them, was overthrown by <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Sergius III</a> (May, 904-August, 911). <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Sergius</a> had been a partisan of Stephen VI, and like the latter regarded the elevation of Formosus to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> as illegal and the orders conferred by him as null and void. Auxilius was a follower of Formosus, and in several works composed about 908-911, he made a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> and learned defence, both of Formosus and of the validity of his orders and those of his adherents. Morinus was the first to publish two of these writings in his "De ecclesiasticis ordinationibus" (Paris, 1665). They are entitled, "Libellus de ordinationibus a pap&acirc; Formoso factis", and "Tractatus qui Infensor et Defensor dicitur".

<p>A third work of Auxilius, of similar import, was found by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> and published by him under the title, "Libellus super caus&acirc; et negatio Formosi pap&aelig;", in his "Vetera Analecta" (ed. 1723, IV, 28-32). In his "Auxilius und Vulgarius", quoted below, D&uuml;mmler published from a Bamberg <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> two further writings of Auxilius, one of which is known as "In defensionem sacr&aelig; ordinationis pap&aelig; Formosi libellus prior et posterior", while the other bears in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> itself the title: "Libellus in defensionem Stephani episcopi et pr&aelig;fat&aelig; ordinationis". (Stephen, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Pope Formosus.) Still another treatise of an unknown author on behalf of Formosus, published by <a href="../cathen/02541a.htm">Bianchini</a> in his edition of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (1735, IV) is considered by <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> (Photius, II, 370, 373, note 9) to be an extract from the writings of Auxilius, while D&uuml;mmler attributes it (op. cit., 42) to Eugenius Vulgarius, an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a defender of Formosus. Two other compositions of Eugenius Vulgarius are known: "De caus&acirc; Formosian&acirc;", and "Eugenius Vulgarius Petro Diacono fratri et amico". All these writings are very important, not only as historical sources but also from a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> point of view, because they take the position that the orders conferred by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not in themselves invalid. In a necrology of the <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Abbey of Monte Cassino</a> is noted on 25 January the death of an Auxilius, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, author of a commentary on Genesis (Mai, Spicilegium Romanum, IX, Appendix; cf. Mabillon, Ann. Ord. S. Benedicti, III, 325). This Auxilius may possibly be identical with the author of the works described above.
