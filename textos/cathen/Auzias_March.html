<h1>Auzias March</h1>  

<p>A Catalan poet, b. perhaps in the last quarter of the fourteenth century, at <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>; d. there in 1458. He is the greatest lyric poet of the older period of Catalan literature, and among foreigners is one of the best to realize the spirit of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> lyric. A <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> work is also apparent in his poetical imagery, which rises superior to that of the troubadour poetry still written by March's contemporaries. According to report, March was a soldier of fame and took part in the expedition of Alfonso V of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> against <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; this report needs verification. He certainly came of a noble stock, and seems to have contracted marriage twice. His extant poems consist of ninety-three <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> songs (or <em>Cants d'amor</em>) and eight death songs or elegies (<em>Cants de mort</em>), besides some moralizing poems (<em>Cants <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a></em>), a long <em>Cant espiritual</em>, and a brief "Demanda feta a la Senyora Na Tecla de Borja". The lady celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Iyrics is said to have been a fair gentlewoman of Valencia, Teresa Bou (or Monboy), whom March met for the first time &mdash; even as <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> had met his Laura &mdash; in church on a <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>. Following <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch's</a> example, the Catalan poets sings her not only in life, but also in death. In these compositions March reveals himself as a genuine poet, in spite of the occasional obscurity of his lines. It is to be remembered also to his credit that the Catalan language was a very imperfect medium for poetical expression when he began to write, so that he had many difficulties to overcome when seeking to give utterance to subtle poetic thought such as <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> had set down in the far more supple Italian. In the "Cants <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>" he brings an indictment against the contemporary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for its materialism and sinfulness while in the "Cant espiritual" he arraigns himself for his own shortcomings. The "Demanda" is a poetical epistle of slight account. It is a notable fact that in his own time March was already lauded as a great poet by the well-informed <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a>, the Marquis of Santillana. In the sixteenth century his Iyrics were translated twice into <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> first by Baltasar de Romani (printed in 1539, four years before the first edition of the original Catalan text), and again by Jorge de Montemayor. His influence is clear in a number of the leading poets writing in Spanish in the same century, such as Boscan, <a href="../cathen/06381a.htm">Garcilaso de la Vega</a>, and Mendoza.
