<h1>Avempace</h1>  

<p>(Ibn Badsha, or Ibn Badja, called by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> Aven-Pace and Avempace).

<p>Arabian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, physician, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, mathematician, and poet, b. at Saragossa towards the end of the eleventh century; d. at Fez, 1138. In 1118 he was at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, where he wrote several treatises on <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>. Later, he went to <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> and to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> He was, according to Arabian accounts, poisoned by rival physicians. He wrote treatises on mathematics, medicine, and philosophy, and commented on several of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> works, notably on the "Physics", "Meteorologica", "De Generatione et Corruptione", portions of "Historiae Animalium" and "De Partibus Animalium". His works on philosophy included <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> treatises, a work "On the Soul", "The Hermit's Guide" (Munk translates the title "Regime du Solitaire"), "On the Union of the Intellect with Man", and a "Valedictory Letter" (Cited in Latin as "Epistola de Discessu" and "Epistola Expeditionis"). Avempace's <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> treatises are said to exist in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> Library. His other writings are either lost or still undiscovered. Fortunately, however, a Jewish writer of the fourteenth century, Moses of Narbonne, has left us an account of "The Hermit's Guide", which supplements <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes'</a> unsatisfactory allusions to that work, and enables us to describe the doctrines it contains. The aim of the treatise is to show how man (the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>) may, by the development of his own powers of mind, attain a union with the Active Intellect. (See "Arabian School of Philosophy"). Avempace distinguishes two kinds of action: animal action, which is a product of the animal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and human action, which is a product of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that is of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> and reflection. The man who smashes a stone because it has hurt him performs an animal action; but he who smashes the stone so that is will not injure others performs a human action. Now, the first step in the moral <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> is to teach himself to be ruled by will and reason, so that his actions may all be human. That, however, is only the first step. Having attained it, the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> must strive to higher perfection, so that his actions may become divine. He must strive to come in contact with the spiritual forms, which ascend in increasing degrees of incorporeity from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> up to the Actual Intellect itself, above which are only the forms of celestial bodies, that is to say, spiritual substances which, while they have an important cosmic function, have no relation to moral excellence in man. Through <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, therefore, to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, through these to abstract <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of things, and through these last, to the pure form of the Active Intellect &mdash; this, according to Avempace, is the way of perfection. The mind which has come into contact with the Active Intellect becomes itself an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the Acquired Intellect (<em>Intellectus Adeptus</em>). It is in reference to this last point that the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>, notably <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, mention Avempace and his teaching. Their acquaintance with the author of "The Hermit's Guide" was made, probably, through his disciple and admirer <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>, through certain passages in the "Contra Gentiles" would justify the surmise that <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> had perhaps a firsthand acquaintance with the "Epistola Expeditionis".
