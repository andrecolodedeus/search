<h1>Averroes</h1>  

<p>(Abul Walid Mahommed Ibn Achmed, Ibn Mahommed Ibn Roschd).

<p>Arabian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, and writer on <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>; born at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, 1126; died at <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, 1198.

<p>Ibn Roschd, or Averroes, as he was called by the Latins, was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in his native city, where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and grandfather had held the office of <em>cadi</em> (judge in civil affairs) and had played an important part in the political history of Andalusia. He devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, medicine, and mathematics, as well as to philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Under the Califs Abu Jacub Jusuf and his son, Jacub Al Mansur, he enjoyed extraordinary favor at court and was entrusted with several important civil offices at <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>. Later he fell into disfavor and was banished with other representatives of learning. Shortly before his death, the edict against <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> was recalled. Many of his works in <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> had, however, been consigned to the flames, so that he left no <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and the end of the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, which occurred shortly afterwards, turned the current of Averroism completely into Hebrew and Latin channels, through which it influenced the thought of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian Europe</a> down to the dawn of the modern era.

<p>Averroes' great medical work, "Culliyyat" (of which the Latin title "Colliget" is a corruption) was published as the tenth volume in the Latin edition of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> works, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1527. His "Commentaries" on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, his original <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> works, and his treatises on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> have come down to us either in Latin or Hebrew translations. His "Commentaries", which earned for him the title of the "Commentator", were of three kinds: a short paraphrase or analysis, a brief exposition of the text, and a more extended exposition. These are known as the Minor, the Middle, and the Major Commentary, respectively. None of them is of any value for the textual criticisms of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, since Averroes, being unacquainted with Greek and Syriac, based his exposition on a very imperfect Arabic translation of the Syriac version of the Greek text. They were, however, of great influence in determining the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and scientific interpretation of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. His original <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> treatises include: a work entitled "Tehafot al Tchafot", or "Destructio Destructiones" (a refutation of Algazel's "Destructio Philosophorum") published in the Latin edition, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> 1497 and 1527, two treatises on the union of the Active and Passive intellects, also published in latin in the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> edition; <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> treatises on the different parts of the "Organon", published in the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> edition under the title "Quaesita in Libros Logicae Aristotelis"; physical treatises based on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> "Physics" (also in the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> edition); a treatise in refutation of <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, and another on the agreement between philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Of the last two, only Hebrew and Arabic texts exist.

<p>Averroes professed the greatest esteem for <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. The word of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Stagirite</a> was for him the highest expression of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in matters of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. In this exaggerated veneration for the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> he went farther than any of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>. Indeed, in the later stages of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> it was the Averroists and not the followers of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Aquinas</a> and <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> who, when accused of subservience to the authority of a master, gloried in the title of "Aristotle's monkey". Averroes advocated the principle of twofold <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, maintaining that religion has one sphere and philosophy another. Religion, he said, is for the unlettered multitude; philosophy for the chosen few. Religion teaches by signs and symbols; philosophy presents the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself. In the mind, therefore, of the truly enlightened, philosophy supersedes religion. But, though the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> sees that what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, he should not on that account condemn religious instruction, because he would thereby deprive the multitude of the only means which it has of attaining a (symbolic) <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Averroe's philosophy, like that of all other Arabians, is <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a> tinged with <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a>. In it we find the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of matter as a positive principle of being; the concept of a multitude of spirits ranged hierarchically between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and matter and mediating between them; the denial of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence</a> in the commonly accepted sense; the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that each of the heavenly spheres is animated; the notion of emanation or extraction, as a substitute for creation; and, finally, the glorification of (rational) mystical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as the ultimate aspiration of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> &#151; in a word, all the distinctively <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> elements which Arabians added to pure <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a>.

<p>What is peculiar in Averroes' interpretation of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> is the meaning he gives to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Active and Passive Intellect. His predecessor, <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, taught that, while the Active Intellect is universal and separate, the Passive Intellect is individual and inherent in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Averroes holds that both the Active and the Passive Intellect are separate from the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and are universal, that is, one in all men. He thinks that Alexander of Aphrodisias was wrong in reducing the Passive Intellect to a mere disposition, and that the "other Commentators" (perhaps Themistius and Theophrastus) were wrong in describing it as an individual substance endowed with a disposition; he maintains that it is, rather, a disposition in us, but belonging to an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> outside us. The terms <em>Passive, Possible, Material</em> are successively used by Averroes to designate this species of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which, in ultimate analysis, if we prescind from the dispositions of which he speaks, is the Active Intellect itself. In other words, the same <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which, when in the act of actually abstracting intelligible species is called active, is called passive, possible or material so far as it is acted upon, is potential, and furnishes that out of which <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are fabricated. Besides, Averroes speaks of the Acquired Intellect (<em>intellectus acquisitus, adeptus</em>), by which he means the individual mind in communication with the Active Intellect. Thus, while the Active Intellect is numerically one, there are as many acquired intellects as there are individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with which the Active Intellect has come in contact. (The <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> speak of <em>continuatio</em> of the universal with the individual mind, translating literally the Arabic word which here means contiguity rather than union.) The sun, for instance, while it is and remains one source of light, may be said to be multiplied and to become many sources of light, in so far as it illuminates many bodies from which its light is distributed; so it is with the universal mind and the individual minds which come in contact with it.

<p>The weakness of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> explanation of the origin of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is its failure to take account of the facts of consciousness, which, as the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> were not slow to point out, indicate that not merely an individual disposition but an active individual principle enters into the action which ones expresses by the words "I think". Another weakness of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of monopsychism, or the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that there is but one mind, a weakness at least in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, is that it leaves unanswered the question of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Indeed, Averroes openly admitted his inability to hold on philosophic grounds the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of individual <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, being content to maintain it as a religious tenet. Averroes' greatest influence was as a commentator. His doctrines had a varying fortune in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. At first they secured a certain amount of adherence, then, gradually, their incompatibility with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> became apparent, and finally, owing to the revolt of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> from everything <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a>, they secured once more a temporary hearing. His commentaries, however, had immediate and lasting success. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> used the "Grand Commentary" of Averroes as his model, being, apparently, the first <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> to adopt that style of exposition; and though he refuted the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Averroes, and devoted special treatises to that purpose, he always spoke of the Arabian commentator as one who had, indeed, perverted the Peripatetic tradition, but whose words, nevertheless, should be treated with respect and consideration. The same may be said of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> references to him. It was after the time of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> that Averroes came to be represented as "the arch-enemy of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>".
