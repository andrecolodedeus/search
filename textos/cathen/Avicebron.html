<h1>Avicebron</h1>  

<p>Salamo Ben Jehuda Ben Gebirol (or Gabirol), whom the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, taking him for an Arabian, called Avicebrol (this form occurs in the oldest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; the later <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> have Avicebron, etc.).

<p>Avicebron was a Jewish religious poet, moralist, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. He was born at <a href="../cathen/09565b.htm">Malaga</a> in 1020 or 1021, and died at Saragossa in 1070. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, where he spent the remainder of his life, devoting himself to moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> philosophy, and writing religoius poetry. His principal <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> work, written in Arabic, was translated into Hebrew in the thirteenth century by Falaquera, and entitled "Mekor Chajim" [this was discovered and edited with French translation by Munk, "Melanges" etc. (Paris, 1857), and into latin in the twelfth century by Johannes Hispanus and Dominicus Gundisallinus (edited by Baumker, Munster, 1895) under the title "Fons Vitae". His poems were published by Munk ("Melanges", etc., Paris, 1857), and a Hebrew translation of his <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> writings (Riva, 1562, and Luneville, 1840). Avicebron's philosophy united the traditional <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> doctrines with the religious teaching of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. From the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a>, whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> chiefly through such <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings as the "Theologia Aristotelis" and the "Liberde Causis" (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/01674c.htm">ARABIAN SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY</a>), he derived the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of emanation, namely: that there emanated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the first place, the Universal Intelligence, that from the Universal Intelligence there emanated the World- Soul, and that from the World-Soul there emanated Nature, which is the immediate principle of productivity of material things. From the same <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> sources he derived the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that matter is of itself wholly inert and merely the occasion which is made use of by the Infinite Agent to produce natural effects (Occasionalism). On the other hand, he drew from Biblical sources the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the Supreme Principle in the production of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was not the Thought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the Divine Will, which, in Scriptural phrase, he calls the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In thus attempting to combine Jewish religious <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> with the notion of emanation, he introduced into his philosophy elements which are <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> incompatible.

<p>His most celebrated <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, however, the one by which he was best known to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, was that of the universality of matter. All created things, he taught, are composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is pure actuality. Everything else, even the highest among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, is made up of matter (not mere potency, but matter like that od terrestrial bodies) and form, just as man is composed of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The matter, however, of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> bodies, while it is like terrestrial matter, is of a purer kind and is called spiritual matter. In other words, there are no created "separate substances", as the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> called them. Between the pure spirituality of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the crude materiality of terrestrial bodies there mediate substances composed of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form, which range in ascending scale of spiritual-materiality from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man to the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> nature. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is mentioned by almost all the great scholastics, and referred by them to the "Fons Vitae" for instance by <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> (Summa Totius Theol., I, q. xlii, art. 22), by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (Quaest. Disp., De Anima, art. 6; Opusculum de Subst. Separatis, <em>passim</em>), and <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> (De Rerum Princip. VIII.4). But, while the first two, in common with other <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> teachers, refuted the author of "Fons Vitae" on this point, the last mentioned, together with <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> and others of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> School, adopted his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as part of their theory of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> nature.
