<h1>Avicenna</h1>  

<p>(ABN ALI AL HOSAIN IBN ABDALLAH IBN SINA, called by the <a href="../cathen/09026a.htm">Latins</a> AVICENNA).

<p><a href="../cathen/01674c.htm">Arabian</a> physician and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, born at Kharmaithen, in the province of Bokhara, 980; died at Hamadan, in Northern <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, 1037. <span class="stiki">Avicenna was actually <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>, not <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a></span>

<p>From the autobiographical sketch which has come down to us we learn that he was a very precocious youth; at the age of ten he knew the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a> by heart; before he was sixteen he had mastered what was to be learned of <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physics</a>, mathematics, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>; at the age of sixteen he began the study and practice of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>; and before he had completed his twenty-first year he wrote his famous "Canon" of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medical science</a>, which for several centuries, after his time, remained the principal authority in <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medical</a> schools both in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. He served successively several <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> potentates as physician and adviser, travelling with them from place to place, and despite the habits of conviviality for which he was well known, devoted much time to literary labours, as is testified by the hundred volumes which he wrote. Our authority for the foregoing facts is the "Life of Avicenna,", based on his autobiography, written by his disciple Jorjani (Sorsanus), and published in the early <a href="../cathen/09026a.htm">Latin</a> editions of his works.

<p>Besides the <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medical</a> "Canon," he wrote voluminous commentaries on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Arisotle's</a> works and two great encyclopedias entitled "Al Schefa", or "Al Chifa" (i.e. healing) and "Al Nadja" (i.e. deliverance). The "Canon" and portions of the encyclopedias were translated into <a href="../cathen/09026a.htm">Latin</a> as early as the twelfth century, by <a href="../cathen/06468a.htm">Gerard of Cremona</a>, Dominicus Gundissalinus, and John Avendeath; they were published at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1493-95. The complete Arabic texts are said to be are said to be in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the Bodleian Library. An Arabic text of the "Canon" and the "Nadja" was published in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1593.

<p>Avicenna's <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, like that of his predecessors among the <a href="../cathen/01674c.htm">Arabians</a>, is <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a> mingled with <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a>, an exposition of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> teaching in the light of the Commentaries of Thomistius, Simplicius, and other <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a>.

<p>His Logic is divided into nine parts, of which the first is an introduction after the manner of Porphyry's "Isagoge"; then follow the six parts corresponding to the six treatises composing the "Organon"; the eighth and ninth parts consists respectively of treatises on rhetoric and poetry. Avicenna devoted special attention to definition, the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of representation, as he styles it, and also to the classification of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">Philosophy</a>, he says, which is the general name for <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, includes speculative and practical <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Speculative <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is divided into the inferior <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> (<a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physics</a>), and middle <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> (mathematics), and the superior <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> (<a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> including <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>). Practical <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is divided into <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethics</a> (which considers <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>); <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economics</a> (which considers <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as a member of domestic <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>); and politics (which considers <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as a member of civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>). These divisions are important on account of their influence on the arrangement of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> in the schools where the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of Avicenna preceded the introduction of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> works.

<p>A favourite principle of Avicenna, which is quoted not only by <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> but also by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>, and especially by <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">St. Albert the Great</a>, was <em>intellectus in formis agit universalitatem</em>, that is, the <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">universality of our ideas</a> is the result of the activity of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> itself. The principle, however, is to be understood in the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">realistic</a>, not in the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">nominalistic</a> sense. Avicenna's meaning is that, while there are differences and resemblances among things independently of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the formal constitution of things in the category of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a>, generic <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">universality</a>, specific <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">universality</a>, and so forth, is the work of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Avicenna's <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physical</a> doctrines show him in the light of a faithful follower of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, who has nothing of his own to add to the teaching of his master. Similarly, in <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, he reproduces <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> doctrines, borrowing occasionally an explanation, or an illustration, from Alfarabi. On one point, however, he is at pains to set the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning, as he understands it, of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, above all the exposition and elaboration of the Commentators. That point is the question of the Active and Passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellect</a>. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/01674c.htm">ARABIAN SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY</a>). He teaches that the latter is the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in the state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potency</a> with regard to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and that the former is the impersonal <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> in the state of <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">actual</a> and perennial thought. In order that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> acquire <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, the Passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellect</a> must come into contact with the Active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellect</a>. Avicenna, however, insists most emphatically that a contact of that kind does not interfere with the independent <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantiality</a> of the Passive <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellect</a>, and does not imply that it is merged with the Active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellect</a>. He explicitly maintains that the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> retains its <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuality</a> and that, because it is <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> and immaterial, it is endowed with personal <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. At the same time, he is enough of a <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystic</a> to maintain that certain choice <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are capable of arriving at a very special kind of union with the Universal, Active, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellect</a>, and of attaining thereby the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">Metaphysics</a> he defines as the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> (ultra-physical) being and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says, the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. It treats of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, which is proved from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of a First Cause; it treats of the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence of God</a>, which, as all the <a href="../cathen/01674c.htm">Arabians</a> taught, is restricted to the universal laws of nature, the Divine Agency being too exalted to deal with singular and contingent events; it treats of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of mediators between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and material things, all of which emanated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Source of all sources, the Principle of all principles. The first emanation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the world of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. This is made up of pure forms, free from change, composition, or imperfection; it is akin to the Intelligible world of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and is, in fact, a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> concept. Next to the world of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> is the world of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, made up of forms which are, indeed, intelligible, but not entirely separated from matter. It is these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that animate and energize the heavenly spheres. Next to the world of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is the world of <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physical</a> forces, which are more or less completely embedded in terrestrial matter and obey its laws; they are, however, to some extent amenable to the power of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a> in so far as they may be influenced by <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">magic art</a>. Lastly comes the world of corporeal matter; this, according to the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> conception which dominates Avicenna's thought in this theory of emanation, is of itself wholly inert, not capable of acting but merely of being acted upon (<a href="../cathen/11195b.htm">Occasionalism</a>). In this hierarchical arrangement of beings, the Active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">Intellect</a>, which, as was pointed out above, plays a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> role in the genesis of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, belongs to the world of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">Ideas</a>, and is of the same <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a> which animate the heavenly spheres. From all this it is apparent that Avicenna is no exception to the general description of the <a href="../cathen/01674c.htm">Arabian</a> <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleans</a> as <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> interpreters of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>.

<p>There remain two other doctrines of general <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> nature which exhibit him in the character of an original, or rather an <a href="../cathen/01674c.htm">Arabian</a>, and not a <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> interpreter. The first is his division of being into three classes: (a) what is merely possible, including all sublunary things; (b) what is itself merely possible but endowed by the First Cause with <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>; such are the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> that rule the heavenly spheres; (c) what is of its own nature <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, namely, the First Cause. This classification is mentioned and refuted by <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>. The second doctrine, to which also <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> alludes, is a fairly outspoken system of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a> which Avicenna is said to have elaborated in a work, now lost, entitled "Philosophia Orientalis". The <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, apparently, know nothing of the special work on <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>; they were, however, aware of the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> tendencies of Avicenna's other works on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and were, accordingly, reluctant to trust in his exposition of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>.
