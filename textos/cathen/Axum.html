<h1>Axum</h1>  

<p>(A<font size=-2>UXUME</font>.)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> list, from about the middle of the fourth century to 650, is found in <a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a> p. 462). Modern Axum is the capital of the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> province of Tigr&eacute;, and nestles in a <em>kloof</em>, or valley, beneath a lofty peak of the Adoua mountains, at 7,545 feet above the level of the sea. Beneath it is a vast plain in which arise several streams tributary to the Nile. "The features of the place", says a recent traveller, "are very marked; firstly one comes across the large sacred enclosure, nearly a mile in circumference, thickly planted with trees and reeds, in the centre of which rises the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, surrounded by the monastic buildings and the residence of the <em>Etchigeh</em>, or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This enclosure occupies nearly the whole of the entrance to the valley; beyond it on the hill slopes are the houses of the inhabitants, whilst running up the valley is the long line of stupendous obelisks and beyond is the ancient tank or reservoir from which the inhabitants still get their water supply" (Bent, The Sacred City of the Ethiopians). &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<p>The city is of great antiquity, and was, together with Adule (Adoua on the coast) known to the Greeks and Romans as the chief centre of trade, with the interior or Africa, for gold-dust, <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, leather, hides, and aromatics. The population is of mixed <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> (negroid) and <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> origin, and is probably descended, in great measure, from an <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> colony settled on the coast at a very remote period. The numerous Himyaritic (Arabic) inscriptions in the vicinity exhibit the influence of Arabia; similarly the stone monuments with their evidences of sun and star worship. Moreover, it is well known that in the sixth century of our era the Kings of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, then and long after resident at Axum, extended their sway over the Sab&aelig;an and Himyarite (Homerite) tribes of Yemen on the opposite Arabian shore. Greek influences are also traceable in the architecture of Axum and from a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, probably from the days of the Ptolemies of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. In other words, this "sacred city of the Ethiopians" has been from time immemorial an outpost of ancient civilization against the mass of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> barbarism. Axum became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> city in the time of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Frumentius, still <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as the great patron of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>; since which time (c. 330) the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Church has remained in close dependency on the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a>, and yet receives from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> its chief <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> officer, the Abouna. There is still extant (P.G. XXV, 635) a famous letter of the <a href="../cathen/16027c.htm">Emperor Constantius</a> (337-361) to Aeizanes, the King of Axum, ordering him to send Frumentius to Alexandria to receive the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> successor intruded in the place of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>. The other principal <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> resident at Axum are the above mentioned <em>Etchigeh (Etchagu&eacute;)</em>, or principal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, always a native; the <em>Nebrid</em>, a kind of <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> or head of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; the <em>Lij Kaneat</em>, or judge in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, together with <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of various grades. There are also many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> known as <em>defteras</em>, described as "lay assistants in all the services, acting as singers and performers in all the church ceremonies; the scribes, advocates, and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> and the most instructed and intelligent people of the land" (Bent, op. cit., 161). &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<p>Axum claims to hold in the innermost recesses of its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> the original Tables of the Law and the <em>tabout</em>, or <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a> say was brought from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to their ancient fortress of Ava by Menelek, the son of Solomon, and the Queen of Sheba, and transferred later to Axum. The palace of that famous Queen is also shown at Axum. Until 1538 Axum was both the civil and religious centre of Abyssoinia. In that year, it was captured by Mohammed, Prince of Le&#239;la, since which time the Negus resides at Gondar. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is a fine edifice, and was built in the sixteenth century during the period of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> influence in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, but on the substructure of a very ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church. It has a flat roof and battlements, and there is a corridor outside where the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> dance and sing. Around the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> are many large shade-trees beneath which are built smaller churches or treasuries, in which are stored valuables of all kinds. Its sacred enclosure is not only the centre of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life, but also one of the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> sanctuaries in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, where any criminal can find shelter by ringing the bell in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> and declaring three times in a loud voice his intention of claiming a refuge. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> are not allowed to enter it. Indeed, all Axum is practically a sacred, inviolable refuge, for which reason the people enjoy a condition of peace and tranquillity unknown elsewhere in <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> (Bent, 163). &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<p>Very interesting are the numerous stone pedestals that once bore metal <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the pre-Christian kings of Axum, memorials of victory, and the stone monoliths and obelisks, fallen or standing, estimated by Bent at about fifty. The latter form "a consecutive series from very rude unhewn stones up to the highly finished and decorated obelisks, and it is highly probable that we have here the origin and development of the obelisk side by side" (Bent, 132). The only standing obelisk of the decorated kind, highly carved with sham doors and beam ends, in imitation of a many-storied edifice, is nine stories high, and ends with a semi-circular finial, on which is still to be seen a representation of the solar disk. "In other words," says Mr. Bent (p. 185) "we have before us a perfect representation of the Beth-el or House of God terminating in the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, in which the Sab&aelig;an sun-god is supposed to reside." Altars for animal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were fitted to the bases of these obelisks; several of them are still visible. Mounds and rubbish heaps are scattered about the sacred enclosure at Axum that doubtless contain many objects of profane and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interest. Near the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is a square enclosure with a pillar at each of its angles, and in the centre twelve stones that <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> tradition says were for the twelve judges of <a href="../cathen/12400b.htm">Prester John</a>, but are probably the bases of ancient triumphal thrones of the Kings of Axum. Among the valuable <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> found in <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a> in modern times is the Book of Axum, or <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Chronicles, brought back by the traveller Bruce. In 1805 the English traveller, Salt, discovered at Axum a bilingual inscription in Greek and Gheez (the religious language of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>) of which only the Greek (thirty-one lines) remains. It refers to the exploits of King Aeizanes, already mentioned. In 1833 the German traveller, R&uuml;ppell, discovered two other Gheez inscriptions, referring to the deeds of a monarch of Axum in the sixth century. These Gheez inscriptions are valuable for the history of the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> alphabet. Some Greek <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, older than the fourth century have been found there, also <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of a somewhat later date, bearing the title "Negush Aksum", or King of Axum.
