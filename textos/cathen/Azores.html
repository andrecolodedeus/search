<h1>Azores</h1>  

<p>(Portuguese <em>Acores</em>, "Falcons")

<p>An archipelago situated in that tract of the Atlantic Ocean which is known to mariners as the Sargasso Sea. The islands lie, approximately, from S.E. to N.W., about a diagonal of the quadrilateral formed by the 37th and 40th parallels of north latitude and the 24th and 32d meridians of west longitude. Their distribution may be considered as forming three subgroups: the relatively large islands of S&atilde;o Miguel and Santa Maria, to the extreme south-east; Fayal, Pico, S&atilde;o Jorge, Terceira, and Graciosa about midway, Terceira being about 880 geographical (1012 English) miles from the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> coast; Flores and Corvo on the extreme north-west. These nine islands, aggregating in area about 922 square miles, vary greatly in size, from S&atilde;o Miguel, with an area of 288, to Corvo, with an area of not more than 5 square miles. The Formigas and other tiny islets throughout the archipelago are of no importance except as perils to navigation.

<p>Physically, the Azores are in general characterized by the bold and irregular conformation usually found in islands of volcanic origin. The snow-capped volcano which is the predominating feature of Pico rises to a height of 8500 feet; the Vara, in S&atilde;o Miguel, is more than 5500 feet; but the crater of the Sete Cidades volcano, also in S&atilde;o Miguel, is said to be not more than 866 feet above the sea level. The volcanic character of these islands is also unmistakably shown by the recurrence in their mountain-formations of more or less extinct craters (locally called <em>caldeiras</em> &mdash; "kettles"), one of which, the Caldeira of Graciosa, forms a steaming lake of pitch. Almost all the islands contain mineral springs, the best known of which are in S&atilde;o Miguel, Terceira, Graciosa, and Flores. As might be expected, the Azores are specially subject to earthquakes; in 1522 the city of Villa Franca, in S&atilde;o Miguel, was destroyed, with, it is said, 6000 of its inhabitants, by an earthquake, and another earthquake, in June, 1811, is memorable for the birth, about two miles off the coast of S&atilde;o Miguel, of the little island which was named Sabrina after the British warship that was present at, and reported, the phenomenon. The climate, through mild and equable, is extremely humid, the number of rainy days in the year averaging about 163, or not far from 50 per cent, and producing a rainfall estimated at very nearly 39 inches; snow never falls, except on the highest mountains; the recorded minimum temperature is about 39&#176;F., the maximum only 81&#176;F. (very exceptionally as high as 86&#176;F.), and the mean for all seasons 63&#176;F.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The existence of this archipelago was not generally known to the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> before the fifteenth century of our era, although there is evidence that <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a>, Scandinavian, and Arabian navigators visited it at different periods. In 1432 the Portuguese, Goncalo Velho Cabral, discovered the island of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a>, and by the year 1457 all the islands had been visited by either Portuguese or <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> explorers, none of whom found any aboriginal inhabitants, wild animals, or reptiles. In 1466 Affonso V of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> granted to the Duchess Isabel of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, his aunt, some sort of <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> privilege in the Azores, in consequence of which the colonists for some time were mostly Flemings, and the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> themselves in those days called the islands <em>As Ilhas Flamengas</em> (the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> Islands). The first Portuguese colonies of any importance in the Azores were those of S&atilde;o Miguel, and Terceira, and at the end of the fifteenth century a certain number of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, driven from <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> by Ferdinand and Isabella, took refuge in the islands.

<p>It was not until 1534 that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization of the Azores was effected. Until then they had been under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">Grand Prior</a> of the Order of Christ. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 5 November, 1534, immediately after that pontiff's accession to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, formed a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> at <a href="../cathen/01513c.htm">Angra</a> do Heroismo, is the island of Terceira, to include the whole of this archipelago. The <a href="../cathen/01513c.htm">See of Angra</a> was made suffragan to that of <a href="../cathen/06318c.htm">Funchal</a>, but in 1547 it was removed from this <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and placed under that of the then <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archiepiscopal</a> (now Patriarchal) See of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. From 1580 to 1640 the Azores, like the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> dominions, had to submit to the rule of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and during that period the neighbouring waters were the scene of many hard fights between the Spanish and the English sea-rovers. The commercial prosperity of the islands declined after the recovery of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> independence and the accession of the House of Braganza in 1640. The city of <a href="../cathen/01513c.htm">Angra</a> attained some slight historical <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriety</a> in 1662, when Affonso VI, deposed by his brother Dom Pedro, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> there. Material prosperity began to be restored to the Azores immediately after the period of the French invasion of the Peninsula and the flight of Jo&atilde;o IV to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> (1807), when the former restrictions of commerce were removed. In the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> revolution of 1828-33, the Azorean populations took a decided stand against the absolutist Dom Miguel, repulsed an attack upon the island of Terceira by a Miguelist fleet, and contributed largely to form the <em>Progressista</em> army which landed at <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a> in 1833, driving Dom Miguel into exile, and establishing on the throne the Queen Donna Maria da Gloria, who for two years preceding had resided at <a href="../cathen/01513c.htm">Angra</a>.
<h2>Present conditions</h2>

<p>The Azores are not a colony, nor a foreign dependency of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, but an integral part of the kingdom. His Most Faithful Majesty is represented in the islands by a governor residing at <a href="../cathen/01513c.htm">Angra</a>, which is regarded as the political capital; at the same time the inhabitants are on a legislative and fiscal equality with those of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> mainland, being regularly represented in the Cortes at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. The total population of the archipelago in the year 1900 was 256,291 (i.e. 277.9 to the square mile), mostly of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> origin, though of course with considerable intermixture of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> blood, with traces of immigration from the British Isles, and a sprinkling of <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>.

<p>Economically, the people of the Azores depend chiefly upon agriculture, this term being taken as including the production of wine. Most of the wine produced in the archipelago comes from the island of Pico, and, under the name of Fayal wine, derived form the port whence it was shipped, used to be famous in bygone days. The area exclusively devoted to vineyards is about 9500 acres (nearly 15 square miles), producing nearly 1,000,000 gallons of wine annually. Wheat and a large variety and abundance of fruits are grown in the valleys. Some 6000 men are employed in the fisheries, and the value of their annual catch amounts to about $175,000. The populations of Terceira, S&atilde;o Jorge, and Graciosa, numbering about 72,000, manufacture cheese, butter, soap, linens, woolens, bricks, and tiles; in Fayal, Pico, Flores, and Corvo a population of 58,000 are chiefly engaged in basket-weaving and the fashioning of small fancy articles from the pith of the fig tree. The latest available statistics give the total of shipping annually clearing and entering all the ports of the Azores as 2,052,792 tones, with a total value of exports and imports $1,050,000.

<p>The people are, with rare exceptions, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Werner (Orbis Terrarum <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicus</a>, s.v.) says that there are only about 100 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and 30 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the whole <a href="../cathen/01513c.htm">Diocese of Angra</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains 110 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and many subsidiary <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/01513c.htm">Angra</a>, under the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> (S&atilde;o Salvador) has its full staff of dignitaries and a chapter of twelve canons, and there is a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> which prepares 120 students for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> number 353 besides which there are eight <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in Terceira and fifteen, including four <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> religious, in S&atilde;o Miguel. The population of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city is about 11,000, that of Punta Delgada, in S&atilde;o Miguel, exceeding it by about 6000.
