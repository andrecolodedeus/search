<h1>Azymites</h1>  

<p>(A privative, and <em>zyme</em>, leaven).

<p>A term of reproach used by the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">schismatic Greeks</a> since the eleventh century against the Latins, who, together with the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, celebrate the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> with unleavened bread. Since reviling is apt to beget reviling, some few Latin controversialists have retorted by assailing the Greeks as "Fermentarians" and "Prozymites". There was, however, but little cause for bitterness on the Latin side, as the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> has always maintained the validity of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> with either leavened or unleavened bread. Whether the bread which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> took and blessed at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> was leavened or unleavened, is another question. Regarding the usage of the primitive Church, our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is so scant, and the testimonies so apparently contradictory, that many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have pronounced the problem incapable of solution.

<p>Certain it is that in the ninth century the use of unleavened bread had become universal and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> in the West, while the Greeks, desirous of emphasizing the distinction between the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Jewish</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Christian Pasch</a>, offered up leavened bread. Some surprise has been expressed that Photius, so alert in picking flaws in the Latin Liturgy, made no use of a point of attack which occupies so prominent a place in the polemics of the later schismatics. The obvious explanation is that Photius was shrewd and learned enough to see that the position of the Latins could not successfully be assailed. Two centuries later, the quarrel with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was resumed by a patriarch who was troubled with no learned scruples. As a visible symbol of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, it had been the custom to maintain Greek churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and some of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> in Constantinople. In 1053, <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a> ordered all the Latin churches in the Byzantine capital to be closed, and the Latin <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to be expelled. As a dogmatic justification of this violent rupture with the past, he advanced the novel tenet that the unleavened oblation of the "Franks" was not a valid Mass; and one of his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, Constantine by name, with a fanaticism worthy of a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>, trod the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Host under his feet. The proclamation of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the West was drawn up by his chief lieutenant, Leo of <a href="../cathen/01103b.htm">Achrida</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>. It was in the form of a letter addressed to John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15016d.htm">Trani</a>, in Apulia, at the time subject to the Byzantine emperor, and by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of Leo the Isaurian attached to the Eastern Patriarchate. John was commanded to have the letter translated into Latin and communicated to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This was done by the learned <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, Cardinal Humbert, who happened to be present in <a href="../cathen/15016d.htm">Trani</a> when the letter arrived. <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> has preserved the Latin version; <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> was so fortunate as to discover the original Greek text (Cornelius Will, Acta et Scripta, 51 sqq.). It is a curious sample of Greek <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>. "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and a feeling of friendliness impelled the writers to admonish the Bishops, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and the Most Reverend Pope himself, concerning their azyms and <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, which were unbecoming, as being Jewish observances and instituted by Moses. But our <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a> is Christ. The Lord, indeed, obeyed the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by first celebrating the legal <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>; but, as we learn from the Gospel, he subsequently instituted the new <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>.... He took bread, etc., that is, a thing full of life and spirit and heat. You call bread panis; we call it <em>artos</em>. This from <em>airoel</em> (<em>airo</em>), to raise, signifies a something elevated, lifted up, being raised and warmed by the ferment and salt; the azym, on the other hand, is lifeless as a stone or baked clay, fit only to symbolize affliction and suffering. But our <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a> is replete with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; it elevates us from the earth to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> even as the leaven raises and warms the bread", etc. This etymological manipulation of <em>artos</em> from <em>airo</em> was about as valuable in deciding a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversy as <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon's</a> discovery that the Greek for "penance" is <em>metanoia</em>. The Latin divines found an abundance of passages in Scripture where unleavened bread is designated as <em>artos</em>. Cardinal Humbert remembered immediately the places where the unleavened <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">loaves of proposition</a> are called <em>artoi</em>. If the writers of the letter had been familiar with the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, they would have recalled the <em>artous azymous</em> of <a href="../bible/exo029.htm#vrs2">Exodus 29:2</a>.

<p>To <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">C&aelig;rularius</a> the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> merit of the controversy was of minor importance. He had found an effective battle-cry, well calculated to infuse into the breasts of his unreasoning partisans that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and defiance of the Latins which filled his own breast. The flour and water wafers of the "Franks" were not bread; their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were invalid; they were <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Their lifeless bread could only symbolize a soulless Christ; therefore, they had clearly fallen into the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Apollinaris. By arts like these, the unfortunate Greeks were seduced from their allegiance to the centre of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity; and a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was precipitated which centuries have not yet healed. It is interesting to notice that this question of azyms, which brought forth a cloud of virulent pamphlets and made a deeper impression on the popular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> than the abstruse controversy of the <em>Filioque</em>, caused little or no discussion among the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> at the Councils of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and Florence. At the latter Council the Greeks admitted the Latin contention that the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the elements was equally valid with leavened and unleavened bread; it was decreed that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of either rite should conform to the custom of their respective Church. Modern Russians have claimed for their nation the dubious <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of having opened this crusade against azyms; but the treatises ascribed to Leontius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kiew, who lived a century earlier than <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">C&aelig;rularius</a>, and in which all the well-known arguments of the Greeks are rehearsed, are judged to have proceeded from a later pen.
