<h1>Baden</h1>  

<p>The Grand Duchy of Baden is situated in the southwestern part of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, bounded by <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, Alsace, the Palatinate, <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and Wurtemberg, covering an area of 5,821 square miles. According to the census of 1 December 1905, the population numbered 2,010,728, including 1,198,511 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 762,826 Evangelicals, 8,006 <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>, 2,060 <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, 2,823 Reformed, 2,157 of various Evangelical <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, 7,449 of other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, 25,893 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and 600 others of various religious persuasions.
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>
<h3 id="A">The Middle Ages</h3>

<p>The present Grand duchy has been formed from the territories of various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular rulers. At the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> the Baden of today was a part of the so-called <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> lands (<em>agri decumates</em>) which were protected by a wall against the barbarian Germans. From this point the Alemanni made repeated incursions into the Roman territory, and after the death of the Emperor Aurelius Probus (282) they took possession of the southern part of the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> lands. The victories of 496 and 536 made the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> masters of this region, and <a href="../cathen/11662b.htm">Pepin the Short</a> set aside the old form of government by tribal dukedoms in 748, introducing the form of organization of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire. The rise of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> power brought <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into the province. The southern part of the country received the Faith about 610 from St. Columbanus and his pupil St. Gall, who were followed a hundred years later by St. Pirminius. <a href="../cathen/15069c.htm">St. Trudpert</a> labored in the Breisgau, and <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a> in the north-eastern part of the territory. The valley of the Rhine was evangelized from <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. Much of the credit for having converted the land belongs to the many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that were founded in the course of these centuries: <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>, Honau near Kehl, <a href="../cathen/15069c.htm">St. Trudpert</a>, Ettenheimmunster, Gengenbach, Schwarzach, St. Michael near <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a>, Petershausen near <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and St. Blasien; also <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as Sackingen, Waldkirch, Sulzburg, and others.

<p>Under the weak rule of the last Carlovingians and after the extinction of the dynasty, the old form of government by tribal dukedoms again prevailed, and only powerful kings like <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, Henry II, and Henry III were able to maintain their authority. The natural allies of the kings against the dukes of the different tribes were the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, who thereby obtained great influence and large possessions. Ecclesiastically the territory of the present Baden was divided into six <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, Worms, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and Wurzburg; moreover the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> were wealthy landed proprietors Henry II having bestowed on them Crown-lands in the Ortenau, as well as placing the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Ettenheimmunster, Gengenbach, and Schuttern under their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> and St. Blasien, in particular, became possessed of large temporalities. Among secular rulers great prominence was attained by Count Berthold (d. 1078), who claimed descent from the old Allemannian dukes and in 1061 became Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. In the struggle between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>, Berthold remained faithful to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The youngest of his three sons, Salomon, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> (1084-1110), and the other two, Berthold II (d. 1111) and Hermann I (d. 1074), were the ancestors of the dukes and margraves of the Zahringen line. The ducal line of descendants received in fief from the Empire a part of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and central and western <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, with Z&uuml;rich as capital. Of these rulers Berthold II founded Freiburg in the Breisgau, Berthold IV, Fribourg in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; and Berthold V, Berne. At the death of Berthold V in 1218 this branch of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> became extinct, and its freehold estates passed on to the margraves of the other branch, whose descendants are still the reigning <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Baden. The first of the line of margraves of this branch was Hermann I, who died a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in the Abbey of Cluny. Many of his descendants distinguished themselves in the affairs of the Empire, as, for instance, Hermann V (1190-1242), who fought against the Mongols, Rudolf I (1243-88), who was first the enemy and then the friend of Rudolph of Hapsburg; Bernhard I (1372-1431), a generous patron of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Gottesaue and Schwarzach; and James I (1431-53), who endowed the collegiate foundation in the city of Baden-Baden. Others, however, lessened the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> influence by the repeated partitions of their estates, thus contributing to the territorial subdivisions of what is now Baden.

<p>Among the neighboring rulers those with the largest landed possessions were the Counts of the Rhine Palatinate (Heidelberg etc.), the Hapsburg dynasty, which in the fourteenth century obtained the whole of the Breisgau, together with the cities of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, Breisach, Waldkirch, and other places; the Counts of F&uuml;rstenberg, whose domains lay chiefly in the region of the Baar (such as the town of Donaueschingen); and the Counts of Wertheim. There were, besides, numerous rulers of smaller secular principalities, <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of the Empire, and free cities. To all these must be added the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rulers, the six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, some 160 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and a few estates held in commendation by Knights of St. John and the German <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, spiritual, and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> life which flourished at this time on the Upper Rhine was as varied as the territorial divisions of the land. Evidences of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> with which the arts and learning were cultivated not only in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but also in the cities, are to be found in the many buildings <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from that period, as, for instance, those at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, Ueberlingen, etc., in monastic <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, in the large attendance at the Universities of Heidelberg, and Freiburg, in the intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, among which the one at Pforzheim won a high reputation, in the diffusion of the art of printing etc. on account of the undeniable abuses which had crept into <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life, many fell under the influence of certain <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> movements which prepared the way for the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, such as secret religious associations, and the Pseudo-mystics, the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06089c.htm">Flagellants</a>, and especially <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>, which was in great favor at the court of the Electors Palatine.


<h3 id="B">From the Reformation to the formation of the present State</h3>

<p>The first impulse to revolutionary religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in Baden came from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> himself, who in 1518 spent some time in Heidelberg, where he appeared as a public speaker and soon gained adherents. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> first took firm root in the Countship of Wertheim, in <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> (1530), in the Countship of Hanau-Lichtenberg (1530), and in the electoral palatinate (1546). Free territories under <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rulers and the House of Hapsburg remained true to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The progress of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in the Margravate of Baden was far from being uniform. Margrave Christopher I of Baden (1475-1527) had in 1503 united all the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> territory, but the division in 1533 between his two sons Bernhard III and Ernest separated the margravate into two parts which were not reunited until 1771. Bernhard received the Margravate of Baden-Baden, and his brother the Margravate of BadenDurlach. A part of the population of Baden-Baden had already adopted the new teachings, but at the death of Bernhard III (1536), Duke Albert V of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the guardian of Bernhard's son, Philip II, brought the country back to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Philip himself (1569-88), who had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, was a vigorous opponent of the new teaching.

<p>The Baden-Durlach branch of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> laid claim to Baden-Baden during the reign of Philip's successor, Edward Fortunatus, (1588-1600), occupied a part of the country until 1622, and introduced the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Margrave William (1622-77), however, after many reverses, succeeded with the aid of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party in the Empire in gaining the undisputed mastery of the margravate. Aided in an especial manner by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, for whom he established houses, he brought the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> part of the country back to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. His successor, Louis William (1677-1707), rendered many services to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Empire in fighting against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> (1683) and the French. Louis William, his wife, Augusta Sibylla, as regent for their son Louis George (1707-61), and the last named in his turn notably furthered the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Baden. With the death of Augustus George (1761-71), who by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> had left the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, and who founded many religious institutions, the line of Baden-Baden became extinct, and the succession fell to the Baden-Durlach branch. Margrave Ernest (1527-53) of Baden-Durlach had favored the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and his son Charles II (1553-77) soon established the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in his domains. After this time the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant religion</a> remained dominant in the land of Baden-Durlach and its supremacy was not affected even by the reconciliation to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of James III, third son of Charles II, as James's death followed soon upon his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> (1690). The most noted of the Baden-Durlach rulers were: Frederick V (1622-59), who founded many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; Frederick VI (1659-77), who distinguished himself by his devotion to the emperor and the Empire; Charles William (1709-38), who in 1715 established the present capital of Karlsruhe, greatly improved the finances and the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> promoted the interests of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. His grandson Charles Frederick (1738-1811), during is long reign introduced salutary reforms in all parts of his territory, thus raising his country from the level of a petty principality to the rank of one of the greater central states of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The extinction of the Baden-Baden branch greatly increased his possessions, which were still further enlarged by the political changes resulting from the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. In 1796 Charles Frederick was forced to surrender to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> his possessions on the left bank of the Rhine, but was amply compensated by the Imperial Delegates' Enactment (1803). He received the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a>, that part of the Rhine Palatinate lying on the right bank of the river, including the cities of Heidelberg, Mannheim, etc., parts of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and Speyer, eleven <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and seven cities of the empire. By the Peace of Pressburg (1805), and the accession of Baden to the Confederation of the Rhine (1806), Baden was still further enlarged by the former possessions of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in the Breisgau, the city of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and other territories, whereby substantially the present boundaries were established. On 13 August, 1806, Baden was proclaimed a Grand duchy. The enforced participation of the duchy in the campaigns of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> resulted in heavy loss of life and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.
<h3 id="C">Recent history</h3>

<p>In 1818 Grand Duke Charles (1811-18), the successor of Charles Frederick, gave the country a fairly liberal constitution. The first Landtag, however, came into conflict with the government of Grand Duke Louis (1818-30), who had been trained in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of absolutism, and was able at times to rule almost despotically. Despite the introduction of many timely reforms during the reign of Grand Duke Leopold (1830-52), there were often bitter contentions between the Government and the representatives of the people. In the course of these difficulties, the opponents of the Government became constantly more inflamed until a leading party of opposition was formed, which, influenced by the prevailing political tendencies, gave evidence of a strong inclination towards radical principles. Radicalism obtained a strong footing not only in the Landtag, but also throughout the country. The revolutionary movement of 1848, which began in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, found, therefore, in Baden a most favorable soil. Although the Government granted many of the demands of the people for more liberal administration, outbreaks occurred. In the beginning these were suppressed, but a mutiny of the troops in Rastatt and Karlsruhe brought victory to the Revolutionists. In May, 1849, the insurgents took possession of Karlsruhe, proclaimed a republic, and established a provisional government. It was only through the aid of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and the German Confederation that the revolution in Baden was repressed, and the Grand duke could reestablish his authority. Severe punishment was meted out to the guilty, especially to the mutinous soldiers.
<h2 id="section2">Ecclesiastical conflicts</h2>

<p>During the reign of Grand Duke Louis II (1852-56), whose brother Frederick held the regency until 1856, when he himself succeeded to the title, the Government and the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who had been at odds for a long time, came into open conflict. The revolutions of the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> period had shaken the organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to its very foundations. In the modern Grand duchy of Baden, as it existed at the beginning of the nineteenth century, two-thirds of the population professed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. They constituted 728 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> divided among six different diocese (<a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, Worms, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and Wurzburg. A reconstruction of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs was manifestly <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and was made, so far as the State was concerned, by the organization decrees of 1803 and the constitutional decrees of 1807, regulating the position of the State with regard to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Although the first of these decrees guaranteed to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> a continuance of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> system, the free exercise of their religion, and the possession and use of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, shortly after their <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> a large number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> were entirely abolished, others confiscated, and still others converted into secular <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>. In place of being organized into <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> as formerly, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were placed under two vicariates (Bruchsal and <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>). A special board was appointed for the administration of the temporal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, first known as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <em>Kirchensektion</em> (Church Section), and later as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <em>Oberkirchenrat</em> (Supreme Ecclesiastical Council). Despite the personal good will of Grand Duke Charles Frederick, the spirit of these decrees was unfavorable to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the State were unduly extended, to the prejudice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Worse than the ordinances themselves was the way in which they were put into execution by the Liberal officials of Old Baden, who viewed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with open hostility. The <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> treatment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the new Grand duchy and the indignities put upon them were so pronounced that even <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, as Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine, in two notes to the Government of Baden (February and March, 1810) protested against it. Unfortunately a large part of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who had either been reared in the tenets of Josephinism, or had fallen into the religious indifferentism of the times, failed to rally to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> defense of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Even the highest ecclesiastical dignitaries of the land, as, for example, <a href="../cathen/15590b.htm">Vicar General Wessenberg</a>, favored the tenets of <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a> and warmly encouraged the project of a German National Church independent of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This state of affairs prolonged for years the negotiations which had been begun with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Baden. Finally the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Provida solersque" (16 August 1821) established the province of the Upper Rhine (<em>Oberrheinische Kirchenprovinz</em>), defined the boundaries of the five <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> therein comprised (Freiburg, <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>), and assigned Freiburg as the seat of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. In Baden, by the order of the Grand duke, the candidate for the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> was elected by free vote of the assembled deans (1822), but their choice of Wanker, a professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, was condemned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as canonically invalid. It was only after lengthy negotiations that an agreement was reached; and on 11 April, 1827, <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of erection "Ad Dominici greys custodian"; on 16 October, 1827, the deed of foundation was signed; and on 21 October the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Bernhard Boll, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and installed.

<p>Nevertheless a satisfactory adjustment of affairs had not been found. The deed of foundation contained many provisions contrary to the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>. In marked contrast to the agreement made with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was the church law passed by the Government 30 January, 1830. True, it ensures to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the free profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and public exercise of religion, but, on the other hand, to the State is given an undue amount of power over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; all orders and enactments of any importance proceeding from spiritual authorities must, according to this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, be submitted to the approval of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil powers</a>; it requires that even decrees and <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> of a general nature issued by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although concerning matters purely spiritual, must be first inspected by the public authorities. It subjects <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a>, Briefs, and <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> to the <em>placet</em> of the sovereign, does away with the canonical court of appeal grants to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, by a usurpation of spiritual authority, recourse to the civil courts instead of the higher <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>, etc. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> entered a protest against the provisions of, this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, so permeated with the spirit of a national church, but without success. Although the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, Bernhard Boll (1827-36) and his successor, Ignaz Demeter (1836-42), acceded to the wishes of the Government as far as their position as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> permitted, all their remonstrances against the interference of the State and their appeals for a more liberal treatment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were useless. On the contrary, the Government openly favored movements of a <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> and irreligious nature, even on the part of professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>; it allowed the just demands of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> for adequate disciplinary powers to pass unnoticed, gave protection to unworthy <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and those who had been insubordinate to their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors, almost entirely excluded the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the management of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and in the administration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, permitted insults to be leveled against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the Radicals in the Landtag, favored Rongeanism, etc. In spite of this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> treatment, however, when, in 1848, the flames of the revolution broke out, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, Hermann von Vicari (1842-68), and the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> remained loyal to the rightful sovereign and refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> required by the revolutionary regime. In consideration of this attitude, the Government, after the victory over the revolutionary forces, seemed disposed to change its policy; it permitted the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to hold missions among the people and allowed the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> greater freedom in the ad- ministration of church discipline. The change, however, was not of long duration; soon the old system of state guardianship was again in force.

<p>The four suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of the Upper Rhine also came into conflict with their respective governments in securing freedom for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. To obtain unity of action Archbishop Vicari, in compliance with the regulations of the plenary council of the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> episcopate held at Wurzburg (1848) summoned his suffragans to Freiburg in the spring of 1851. In a memorial addressed to their respective sovereigns, they demanded the privilege of training their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and appointing them without outside interference, the free exercise of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> among <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and the privilege of conducting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, of establishing religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> and associations, and of administering <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> without hindrance. Having waited in vain for a reply from the Government, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> addressed a reminder to the authorities (February, 1852), renewing the demand for the abolition of the state supremacy. Not until 5 March, 1853, did they receive a decision; this contained trivial concessions, but was adverse on the principal points. The old system of state tutelage was to remain unconditionally in force. Thereupon the five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> reconvened (April, 1853) in <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> and embodied their demands in a second memorial <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 18 June, setting forth the inadequacy of the concessions granted 5 March, and reserving to themselves the right of taking further measures. While four of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> received from their respective authorities more or less far-reaching concessions, a bitter struggle was precipitated in Baden.

<p>Meanwhile, an occurrence in Baden had increased the estrangement to an open rupture between the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. After the death of Grand Duke Leopold (24 April 1852), the Government i.e. the <em>Oberkirchenrat</em>, which in 1845 had taken the place of the <em>Kirchensektion</em>, ordered the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to have services held for the deceased. sovereign. In conformity with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> prohibited the celebration of requiem Masses for <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes and ordered other, appropriate services instead. The authorities, however persisted in their demand, declared the services ordered by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> inadequate, and attempted to induce <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> to celebrate requiem Masses in defiance of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> mandate. Only about sixty out of the 800 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> complied, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> decreed that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who had disregarded his command should, in expiation, attend certain exercises of five days conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13117a.htm">Father Roh</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Peter. Although the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> promised their protection to those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who should resist this sentence, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to a man obeyed the order of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, ensuring him a victory so complete as to give him the power of resistance in further conflicts.

<p>In response to the second memorial from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of the Upper Rhine, the representatives of the State of Baden refused to make a single concession to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> then informed the Government that he would take steps to secure the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> that were his, but were <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> withheld by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. He held competitive examinations for <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> appointments and for admittance into the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, without the presence of a government commissioner; he filled <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> to which the Government could not establish a canonical right of patronage, demanded from the Oberkirchenrat an administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> strictly in accordance with canon law, threatening <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> in case of disobedience. Thereupon the Government placed the official actions of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> under police surveillance, banished the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, and threatened the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who submitted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the loss of their incomes, and with civil punishment. Two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Karlsruhe and Freiburg, who had proclaimed the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> pronounced upon the Oberkirchenrat by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> were actually placed under arrest. On still more unwarrantable interference by the Government, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> issued a circular letter to be read from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a>, ordering an independent administration of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions without regard for civil mandates, and prohibiting the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from having any connection with state officials. The Government, seeing in this enactment an instigation against <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, forbade its <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> in the churches and attempted to seize all copies of the letter, in some cases succeeding by force. A judicial inquiry was instituted against the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (18 May, 1854), charging him with disturbing and endangering the public peace. On 22 May he was placed under arrest, and confined to his room under a guard of gendarmes until 31 May. At the command of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> court continued to transact all business, and sent a dispatch to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> asking the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to make provisions for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. All churches were to be draped in mourning, church bells were silent, alters were stripped of their adornments, and everywhere the faithful assembled for public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in a note <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 8 June, addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> of Baden took the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> under his protection. The government then proposed to enter into negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and a peaceful arrangement was made, which created a tolerable <em>modus vivendi</em>. The proceedings against the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were stopped and gradually the way was opened, for amicable relations between the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>.

<p>The lengthy negotiations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were brought to a close by the signing of the Concordat of 8 June, 1859, which went far towards meeting the just claims of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and accorded practically all the demands of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, in particular the right of appointment to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, religious instruction, participation in the management of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, the right of decision in questions concerning marriage, etc. Thereupon the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> and Democrats rose in opposition to the Concordat; everywhere meetings of protest were held, resulting in 1861 in the dismissal of the Conservative and the formation of a Liberal ministry. The latter, on 29 October, without consulting the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, arbitrarily declared the Concordat null and void and substituted a law quite inimical to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the Landtag. On 20 November, 1861, the Government and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> came to an agreement concerning the filling of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>.

<p>After a short respite, now conflicts arose between the two authorities with reference to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system (1864). The Government, now entirely under the control of the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, proposed a bill for a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> law which almost entirely nullified the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, conceding to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> only the supervision of religious instruction. Although <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> exerted every effort to bring about the failure of this scheme, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in a pastoral letter opposed it, the bill in a somewhat aggravated form became a law, and the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population expressed in numerous mass meetings and addresses to the duke was completely disregarded. The <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, who were in the majority in the Landtag, and had control of the Government, hesitated at nothing to make still more practically effective their principles of hostility to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1867 the Government instituted state examinations for <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students, to be held before a civil commissioner on the completion of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> course. The <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> protested, and forbade the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students to submit to this examination. As a result the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> subject to the appointment of the Grand duke received, instead of their stipends and appointments as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, only those of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> administrators. After the death of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (15 April, 1868), the Government, by refusing to consider seven out of eight candidates, made the choice of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> practically impossible, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for eighteen years. In 1869 <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a> was made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>. In 1870 all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions not purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, but devoted to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> or to charity, were secularized, withdrawn from the control of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and large endowments left for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> purposes were thus alienated from their appointed use. In 1872 the members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations were forbidden to give elementary instruction, to assist in the work of the ministry, or to conduct missions. In 1873 the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a> were placed on an equal footing with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; several <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches were turned over to them, and their Bishop Reinkens was recognized by the Government as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> national <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<em>Landesbischof</em>). In 1874 admission to any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office was made to depend on <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a general scientific training, meaning thereby a three years' course at a German <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, excluding all <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> institutions. The <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys were closed. In 1875 undenominational <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were introduced and made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> corporation <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were made unsectarian, and several <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> were suppressed. Not until after the retirement of the Liberal minister, Jolly, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the anti-Catholic legislation, i.e. since 1876, were measures taken for the re-establishment of peace with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1880 state examinations for <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students were dispensed with; in 1882 the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> was filled by the appointment of Johann Baptist Orbin, who ruled until 1886; his successors were Johann Christian Roos, until 1896; George Ignaz Komp, who died as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> elect on the journey to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> (1896), and Thomas Norber from 1896. In 1888 the boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were reopened, and members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were once more allowed to preach.

<p>Meanwhile the political development of Baden had been undisturbed. In 1866, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the Grand duke had been forced against his will to fight on the side of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and the German Confederation against <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>; but as early as 28 July he arranged a truce and proclaimed his withdrawal from the German Confederation. On 17 August he concluded peace, and an offensive and defensive alliance with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The military forces of Baden were organized on <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> lines, and when, in 1870, Baden openly took sides with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, they fought with distinction in many battles. On 25 November Baden entered the North German Confederation, which was strengthened by the accession of the other South German States to the new <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> (1871). The internal administration was now conducted along Liberal lines. The Liberal majority of the Chamber was not disturbed until 1893. In 1904 a more impartial election law was introduced. The Government, however, still holds to its Liberal tendencies, and refuses the just demands of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for the admission of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men. Unfriendliness towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> seems again to be gaining ground, as is shown by ordinances requiring an investigation among the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> on account of alleged abuses of electoral influence and other charges.
<h2 id="section3">State and Church in Baden</h2>

<p>The relations between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Government are not entirely satisfactory, as is evident from the historical account, the State often exercising an excessive control. According to the legislation now in force, the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a> in Baden possesses the right of a public corporation with the formation of religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> conducts its affairs freely and independently. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are not restricted in their communication with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors. The highest spiritual authority of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Baden is the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, who is also <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of the province of the Upper Rhine; he is a member of the First Chamber of Baden, ranks immediately after the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of state, and enjoys the title of Excellency. Ecclesiastical offices are filled by the church authorities, but are granted only to those who are citizens of Baden and can give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of having had a general scientific training. No exemption from a regular three years' course at a German <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is granted to anyone who has completed the same course at a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> institution. Every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on entering the work of the ministry in Baden must take the constitutional <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. The public exercise of church functions is permitted to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> coming from outside of Baden only under certain conditions. Without government authorization no <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order may be brought into Baden, nor may a new foundation be made by an order already established. Moreover, this authorization is subject to revocation. The holding of missions and the work of the ministry by members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders are in general forbidden, unless in case of extreme necessity. By legislation of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was introduced, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of military service on the part of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students abolished, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and what the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> call "cognate" orders and congregations excluded from the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>.
<h3>Church property</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> board, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church, and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, as well as the funds under the immediate control of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> or the chapter, are managed by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and the chapter without interference; that under rural chapters by the chapters themselves under the supervision of the ordinary; local <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, i.e. the definite <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of a separate <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, is administered by a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> council under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the members being chosen for a period of six years from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions of a district is managed by a commission, half the members being chosen by the Government, and half by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the district. The interealary fund (that is to say, the fiscal department for the collection, management, and lawful expenditure of the incomes of vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in the Grand Duchy of Baden) is administered by a council known as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <em>Oberstiftungsrat</em>, consisting of a president and six members, under the joint supervision of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and Government. The members are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, half being appointed by Government, and half by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. All must meet the approval of both. The president must also be selected and named with the consent of both. The Oberstiftungsrat also supervises the administration of the local and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institutions and of all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, occupied or vacant.

<p>Local associations of the members belonging to the churches recognized in Baden have, as <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of public corporations. For the defrayal of expenses incident to public worship, as, for example, the maintenance and repair of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and rectories, the purchase and care of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> church furniture, and the salaries of the under employees of the church, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> can assess certain taxes on its members. There is, in addition, a general church assessment for the common needs of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Baden, e.g. the expenses of the highest <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, the establishment of new church offices, etc. The execution of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> is vested in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> meeting; in those <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> numbering eighty or more members, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> is represented by an elective council. The resolution of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> meeting or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> council determining the church assessment is subject to the approval of the State. To become legally effective, any change in the formation of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> by reorganization, dissolution, partition or reunion, needs the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. The administration of <a href="../cathen/06157b.htm">ecclesiastical foundations</a> (<em>Stiftungen</em>) is also entirely subject to state supervision. All gifts and bequests in favor of existing foundations, likewise the establishment of new and independent ones, require the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the State. Churches, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and other public foundations devoted to the care of the poor and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and to similar charitable purposes, are exempt from the house tax. Homes for the care of the sick and the support of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, as well as public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>, are exempt from the income tax on the capital invested. The taxable values of rectories are exempt from any <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> assessment.
<h3>Church and school</h3>

<p>The public <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system is under the direction of the State, the highest authority being the <em>Oberschulrat</em> (Supreme Educational Council), which is directly subject to the Minister of the Interior. The highest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors may designate a representative to attend the deliberations of the Oberschulrat whenever there is question of religious instruction and its place in the plan of studies. In the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> instruction is given simultaneously to all children of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> age, regardless of creed, with the exception of religious instruction. The local supervision over the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, as well as the supervision of all local <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> funds, including those of each religious confession, is entrusted to the town council; at the same time each of the creeds represented in the community is represented by its <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In the appointment of teachers to public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> all possible respect is had for the religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the children; in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> attended by children of only one creed the teachers are to be of that creed. Religious instruction is provided and supervised by the respective churches and congregations. They may be assisted in this by teachers. The general plan of religious instruction is laid out by the higher spiritual authorities and supervised by their deputies. The establishment of private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> is permitted, but only under certain conditions; these establishments are under state supervision; from time to time the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> authorities visit them and hold examinations. Ecclesiastical corporations and institutions may found <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> only on the passage of a special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders or of religious congregations that resemble orders are forbidden to teach in any <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institution</a> in the Grand Duchy of Baden. The Government may grant exemption to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but such exemption is revocable at will. Churches are authorized to maintain institutions for the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and practical training of young men for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and to conduct boarding houses (<em>Konvikte</em>) for students who frequent the gymnasia or the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with the intention of preparing themselves for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Statistics</h2>

<p>Baden, with the Hohenzollern territories belonging to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, forms the <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Archdiocese of Freiburg</a>. The strong intermixture of creeds throughout Baden is a result of the earlier territorial dismemberment described above. According to the census of 1905, in 34 of the 53 judicial districts, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are in the majority. They are especially strong in the north-east (the Tauber valley), the farther Odenwald, and the southern half of Baden. Even here, however, predominantly <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> districts are to be found, e.g. Kehl, Lahr, Emmendingen, the Margravate of Sulzburg as far as Basle, and the valley of the Wiese as far up as Lorrach; in addition to the districts just mentioned, the country on both sides of the Neckar and the Lower Rhine are overwhelmingly <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. Ecclesiastically, Baden is divided into 3 city chapters and 36 rural chapters, with about 814 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and curacies, 114 chaplaincies, and 259 assistants. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Peter are exempted from the above-mentioned chapter system. Besides this, there are 3 military and 3 institutional chaplaincies. At the beginning of 1907 Baden had 1,260 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, assistants, and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. Of the 1187 <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> of Baden, 295 are in the gift of the Grand duke as patron; 264 are left to the free collation of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>; 145 are filled through presentations by noblemen, landowners, and others; 168 are disposed of by the so called <em>terna</em>, i.e, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> proposes to the Grand duke three candidates for a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, and the latter selects one for <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>. In the case of 9 <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> is alternate; in 47 cases it is disputed or unknown. The salary of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is derived from the temporalities of the living; the income of poorly equipped <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> is supplemented by an annual state appropriation which sometimes amounts to $50,000.
<h3>Orders and congregations</h3>

<p>Male orders and congregations are prohibited from making any foundations in the Grand Duchy of Baden. In proportion to the population, the number of orders and congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is small, and new foundations are vigorously opposed by the Government. The following teaching orders are represented: the Sisters of the Holy Sepulcher in Baden-Baden, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Sisters in <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Sisters in Lichtenthal near Baden-Baden, in Offenburg the Choir Sisters of St. Augustine from the congregation of Notre Dame (with a branch in Rheinburg), the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> in Villingen (with a branch in Breisach); there are in all 5 orders for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls. The following congregations for the care of the sick are represented in Baden: the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, with mother-house at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, the Sisters of St. Francis, with mother-house at Gengenbach, the <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>, from Ingenbohl in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, with mother-house at Hegne, near <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. In addition there are in Baden the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentian</a> Sisters from the mother-house at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, Sisters of the Most Holy Savior (the so-called Niederbronn Sisters), from the mother-house at Oberbronn, Alsace, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters from the mother-house at Mallersdorf, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Josephite Sisters from St. Marx (Alsace), also <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a> from the motherhouse at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>.
<h3>Education</h3>

<p>As explained above, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system is entirely under the direction of the State; consequently there are but few purely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>. For the training of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there are the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (<em>Priester-seminar</em>) at St. Peter, the home (<em>Konvikt</em>) for <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, and 4 gymnasial boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, Rastatt, and Tauberbischofsheim. At the state <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (Freiburg) there is a faculty of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> numbering 11 professors; the number of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students during the summer semester of 1907 was 226. The 62 Government intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Baden (17 classical gymnasia, 3 "real," 4 preparatory, 7 higher gymnasia; 23 <em>Realschulen</em>, 8 high schools) recorded an attendance in 1905 of 5,157 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> students. In 17 of the Government intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> religious instruction is given by 26 specially appointed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (<em>Religionslehrer</em>); in the others religious instruction is cared for by the local <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Of the 11 private intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, the Institute and School of Monsignor Lender in Sasbach (<em>Progymnasium</em> and <em>Realschule</em>) is <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in character; in 1905 it had 483 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> students, and 8 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as religious instructors. The 7 government high schools for girls had in 1905 an attendance of 964 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> students. Of the 33 private intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls, attended by 1,437 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> girls, 5 are distinctly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in character, and have an attendance of 1,132. The <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a> now published in Baden number 25.
<h3>Charitable institutions</h3>

<p>In Baden there are 254 institutions for the care of the sick, with 13,800 beds; about 100 of these <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, infirmaries, etc. are directed, or are actually served, by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> orders and congregations. The <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Diocese of Freiburg</a> contains 3 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> (Riegel, Gurtweil, and Walldurn); in the village of Herthen there is a large institution for the care of imbeciles, with about 400 inmates, under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>; in Heitersheim there is a large institution for the reclamation of girls, directed by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sisterhood. The Baden non-sectarian Red Cross Society, to which many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> belong, has 34 relief centers for men, with about 5,500 members, and 333 unions for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with 57,600 members; the association maintains 75 stations with about 470 employees. There are in Baden 13 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> homes for servant girls.
<h3>Catholic societies</h3>

<p>Concerning these <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> there are no adequate statistics. We may mention, however, the People's Union (<em>Volksverein</em>) for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, with 27,100 members, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> working-men's unions (150), <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journeymen's unions (53), apprentices' unions and clubs for young men (35), and St. Joseph's unions (2). Freiburg is the center of the associated Charities (<em>Charitasverband</em>) of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The chief religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> and confraternities are: the Archconfraternity of the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar, the Most Pure Heart of Mary, and of Christian Mothers, the League of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the Association of the Holy Family, the Association of the Holy Childhood of Jesus, the Boniface Society, the Ludwig Mission Society, St. Michael's Society, the Societies of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> for men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and others.

<p>The most important <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church edifices are the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> and <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, the churches of Ueberlingen and Breisach, and those of Baden-Baden, Salem, St. Blasien, <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>, Gengenbach, Bronnbach, Schwarzach, Ladenburg, Neustadt, Karlsruhe.
