<h1>Bagdad</h1>  

<p>This city was founded on the Tigris by the second Abbaside Caliph Abou Giafar al Mansur (762 or 764) and named by him Medinet es-Selam, or City of Salvation; Bagdad is a popular name said to mean "Garden of Dat", a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> dervish. During five centuries it was the rich and brilliant capital of the famous Arabian Empire. Houlagou, a grandson of Genghis Khan, entered it in 1262; it afterwards became a possession of the Kara Koyouli <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, was taken by Tamerlane, and, in 1517, fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> who, except for a short interval in the sixteenth century, ruled over it until 1638, when Sultan Murad made it definitively a city of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a>. It is now the chief town of a vilayet, or district, of the same name, and has lost much of its former importance, though it still remains the most important city of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> Turkey, after Damascus and Smyrna, and a great emporium of international trade. It exports textile fabrics, gold and silverware, horses, dates, etc. There are many beautiful mosques in the city, and the ruins of its ancient walls are still visible. The climate is hot; fevers are frequent, and the plague sometimes appears. Its population, taken as including the neighbouring villages, is said to be about 45,000; of these 86,000 are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, mostly <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> Sunnites and Persian Shiites; 52,000 are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and 7,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> statistics, however, are usually very uncertain. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are divided as follows: 3,300 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> (including about 1,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 100 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>), 100 Greeks (50 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>); 1,600 (3,000?) Chaldeans; 1,200 Syrians; and 500 Latins.

<p>In 1638, some days after the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> conquest, owing to the kindness of Abbas the Great, <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> created, at the expense of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> French lady, a Latin <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, under the title of Babylon, the old city being then (though <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a>) identified with Bagdad. For a long time the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this title, when they came to the East, resided at Hamadan, in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and for various reasons there were often no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but only <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>. It was only in 1742 that P&egrave;re Joseph-Marie de J&eacute;sus, a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, was allowed to enter this <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> town. In 1848 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> became an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, with Ispahan as a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, till 1874; the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Monsignor Trioche, was appointed <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Oriental rites. He resigned this office in 1850, and until his death, in 1887, there were special delegates, the last of whom, Monsignor Altmayer, succeeded him and reunited both titles, as did his successor, Monsignor Jean Drure. We must here, moreover, notice that the Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Bagdad, according to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/15218a.htm">Urban VII</a>, must always be of French nationality.

<p>The limits of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> extend as far as Assyria, Mesopotamia, and the territories of Bassorah and Amida, with about 2,000 Latin faithful, mostly foreigners. It includes three Apostolic prefectures: Bagdad, <a href="../cathen/09650e.htm">Mardin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10598b.htm">Mossul</a>. The Prefecture of Bagdad is governed by French Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, who have at Bagdad a large and beautiful college, an elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, a dispensary, and stations at Bassorah, Amarah, and Bushire, with primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and some ten churches or little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. French Sisters of the Presentation of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> conduct at Bagdad an important <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans'</a> institute. For the Prefectures of <a href="../cathen/09650e.htm">Mardin</a> (French <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>) and Mossul <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>), see articles under those titles.

<p>The Apostolic Delegation of Bagdad, for Mesopotamia, Kurdistan, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> Minor, is, as appears from its official appellation, more extensive than the Latin <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>. It embraces 5 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, with 40 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and about 12,000 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; 5 Syrian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, with 80 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and about 12,000 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; 9 Chaldean <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, with 160 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and about 40,000 faithful.

<p>Since the foundation of the Chaldean <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> in 1681, after the conversion of a great many <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, the Chaldean patriarch bears the title of Babylon, i.e. Bagdad. His residence was first at Diarbekir, then at Bagdad (since about 1838), and is now at <a href="../cathen/10598b.htm">Mossul</a>. A Syrian <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> was also erected in 1862, with the same title of Babylon, or Bagdad; and the titular resides, or is authorized to reside, at Bagdad.

<p>According to Bar-Hebr&aelig;us ("Chronicon Eccl.", ed. Lamy, II, 236), Elias, the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, in 910 re-established at Bagdad the ancient residence of the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> which had been unoccupied since the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Schism (432). The Greek name for Bagdad was Eirenopolis, the equivalent of Medinet es-Selam. Eirenopolis is now considered among the Greeks a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> title, and is held by a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who assists the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> as his vicar.
