<h1>Baldwin</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, born 1285; died 1354; he belonged to the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Counts of Luxemburg, or Lutzelburg, and was a brother of the Emperor Henry VII. When he was only three years of age, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Count Henry III, was killed in battle. The charge of Baldwin's <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, therefore, devolved on his mother, <a href="../cathen/02375a.htm">Beatrix</a> of Avesnes, and his brother, the future emperor. Being exceptionally talented, he was sent at the early age of thirteen to the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, where, under the direction of two private tutors, he received a thorough <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In 1305, when the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> died, Henry wished to procure this <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> and electorate for his brother, and sent his former physician, Peter Aichspalter, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle, to <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Pope Clement V</a>, at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, with instructions to use his influence in behalf of Baldwin. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, refused to entrust the most important <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to a youth who was then only nineteen years old. When Aichspalter, shortly after, cured the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of a severe sickness, he was himself made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, with the understanding, it seems that Baldwin was to succeed the aged Archbishop Diether of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Accordingly, when Diether died in 1307; Baldwin became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and Elector of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, March 11, 1308, at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself and took possession of his <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> on the June 2nd, in the same year.

<p>Though only twenty-two years old, Baldwin had many Qualities which fitted him for the triple office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, prince, and elector. Without levying special taxes he paid off within a short time the many <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> incurred by his predecessor, and he fearlessly asserted his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of sovereignty over the refractory municipal authorities of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Shortly after the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the Emperor Albert was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> (May, 1308), and Baldwin, acting with Archbishop Aichspalter of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, prevailed upon the other electors to award the imperial crown to Henry of Luxemburg. During the short reign of Henry VII (1309-13) Baldwin was his brother's most influential adviser and accompanied him in his expeditions through the empire and to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After Henry's death he desired as emperor his nephew, King John of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, then only eighteen years old. However, seeing the futility of his efforts to win the other electors for King John, and fearing the election of Frederick of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, who was hostile to the house of <a href="../cathen/09465a.htm">Luxemburg</a>, Baldwin urged the election of Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. But all his attempts to gain over the opposing electors were unsuccessful, and a double election resulted. During the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of eight years which ensued he fought on the side of Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, and contributed largely to his final success. In the conflict between Louis and <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a>, which was equally disastrous to Church and Empire, Baldwin also sided with Louis, and for this reason did not receive the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> when the Cathedral Chapter of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> postulated him as successor to Aichspalter (who died 5 June, 1320). Upon the death, in 1328, of Matthias, whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, to succeed Aichspalter, Baldwin was again postulated as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by the Cathedral Chapter of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, took possession of the archdiocese, and administered it nearly nine Tears (1328-37), despite the protests of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who had appointed Henry Virneburg to the position. On the 16th of July, 1338, he took an important part in the meeting of the imperial electors at Rense, near Coblenz, where they protested against all <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> interference in the election of the emperors and decided that the emperor elected by them could exercise his imperial authority without the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. When <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement I</a> renewed the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, and there was hope that Charles IV, a grandnephew of Baldwin would receive the imperial crown, Baldwin finally abandoned the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> and at a meeting at Rense (11 July, 1346) prevailed upon the other electors to declare Louis deposed and elect Charles IV emperor. Baldwin <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the new emperor at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, 26 July, 1349.

<p>Within his own diocese Baldwin successfully fought against the many robber-barons who at that time infested <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He destroyed their strongholds and forced the barons to submit to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or leave his domain. He promoted commerce by erecting the bridge which still spans the River Moselle at Coblenz. Numerous churches in various parts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were built by him, and many wholesome decrees were passed at the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> which he convoked. But Baldwin, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, dwindles beside Baldwin, the soldier and statesman. During the forty-six years of his reign (1308-54) the destinies of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> largely guided by the powerful hands of this prelate-prince. He was a shrewd diplomat and a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> soldier, but above all he was a member of the house of <a href="../cathen/09465a.htm">Luxemburg</a>, and its aggrandizement was the mainspring of his political activities. The <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignonese</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> and <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, may have set up <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> claims in regard to the imperial Office, but there is no justification for Baldwin's siding with Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> even after that emperor was deservedly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. There may have been palliating circumstances as to his administration of the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Archdiocese of Mainz</a> in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> command, but, as a subject of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he should have submitted. He was the author of the so-called "Balduineum," a collection of documents relating to the possessions and privileges of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, together with a series of pictures bearing on Henry's expedition to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which was republished at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> in 1881. His remains lie in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>.
