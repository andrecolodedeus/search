<h1>Baldwin of Canterbury</h1>  

<p>Thirty-ninth <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, a native of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. 19 Nov., 1190. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and made <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> by Bartholomew, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a>. He subsequently became a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at the Abbey of Ford, in Devonshire, and within a year was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ford. In 1180 he was promoted to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> and in the same year was elected to the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> see by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province. The election was disputed by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, who chose first the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Battle, then Theobald, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. King Henry II interfered. Baldwin, who, according to <a href="../cathen/06536b.htm">Gervase</a>, refused to accept the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishopric</a> unless he was elected by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, was installed, and an arrangement was entered into by which, in the future, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> elections were to be disallowed. He was several times engaged in disputes with the Canterbury <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, necessitating the further interference of <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">King Richard</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The prior, Norreys, whom he had nominated, was deposed; but his right to appoint the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> was acknowledged.

<p>Baldwin acted as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, where he held a visitation in 1187, and in 1188 preached the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>, after having himself taken, The cross on hearing the news of the loss of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. In 1190 he set out for the Holy Land, in company with Hubert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, and others, providing at his own costs two hundred <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> and three hundred retainers. While there he acted a vicegerent of the patriarch. Girdles Cambrensis describes he as gentle, kindly disposed, learned, and religious. He died during the siege of Acre, leaving all he possessed for the relief of the Holy Land and naming Bishop Hubert as his executor. His works (to be found in the "Bibliotheca Patrum Cisterciensium", V) are "De Commendiatione Fide"; "De Sacramento Altaris". There are also some discourses and a penitential in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Preserved in the Lambeth Library.
