<h1>Balearic Isles</h1>  

<p>A group in the western part of the Mediterranean belonging to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and consisting of four larger islands, Majorca, <a href="../cathen/10332a.htm">Minorca</a>, Iviza, and Formentera, and eleven smaller islands of rocky formation. Politically they form the Balearic province, and on 31 December, 1900, had an area of 1936 square miles and a population of 311,649, almost exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The capital is Palma. The original inhabitants of these islands were of Iberian stock, and were famous in antiquity as slingers. In the seventh century B.C., they were subjugated by the Carthaginians; in 206 B.C., the city of Mahon was built by Hannibal's brother Mago and called after his name. In 123-122 B.C., the Roman consul Quintus Caecilius Metellus conquered the islands and founded the cities of Palma and Pollentia. The Romans were succeeded in the sovereignty of the islands by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> (426) under Genseric as leader; during the reign of Justinian they were subject to <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine</a> authority. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> incorporated them for a while with the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> empire, but in 798 they fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. About 1230 James I (Jaime) of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> gained possession of the island and conferred the sovereignty on his third son, who transmitted it to his descendants; from 1276 to 1343 they formed the independent kingdom of Majorca, a secundo geniture of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, at the latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> being reunited to the Crown. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the Spanish Succession Minorca was occupied by the English (1708) and remained, with the exception of a brief interval (1756-63), in their possession until by the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a> (1783) the islands were ceded back to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> reached the Balearic Isles almost as soon as the Spanish mainland. As early as the fourth century mention is made of Bishops of <a href="../cathen/10332a.htm">Minorca</a> and in the fifth century of Bishops of <a href="../cathen/09556b.htm">Majorca and Iviza</a>. During the period of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> rule these sees were suppressed, and the islands were placed under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>. After the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> a see was re-established on the island of Majorca (1237), in direct dependence on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and in 1238 Raymund de Torella was made first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which has been ruled by fifty-two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> up to the present time, was made subject to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a> in 1492; in 1782 Iviza, and in 1795 Minorca were erected into separate <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. In 1851 Iviza was reunited with Majorca. The Balearic Isles are at present divided into two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> subject to the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Valencia: Majorca and Iviza (<em>Diocesis Majoricensis et Ibusensis</em>), with Palma as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and Minorca (<em>Diocesis Minoricensis</em>), with Ciudadela as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>.

<p>The Diocese of Majorca, exclusive of Iviza, embraces the islands of Majorca, Cabrera, and Colubraria; in 1906 it contained a population of 262,000, divided into 8 <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archipresbyterates</a>, 39 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and (at the beginning of 1907) 47 mission churches; 704 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, including 60 who are not residing in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; 318 churches and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists of 5 <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendaries</a>, 4 officials, and 7 canons. The training of young men for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is provided for in the <em>seminario <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a></em> in Palma which has 12 professors and 145 students. In 1907 the diocese contained 33 houses of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders conducted by 13 religious congregations of men: <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> 1; <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> 1; <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a> 1; <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a> 1; Tertiaries regular of St. Francis 3; Mission Priests of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> 1; <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians of St. Philip Neri</a> 2; <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> 4; <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> 5; Missionaries of the Most Sacred Hearts 4; <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> 2; <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a> of Sts. Paul and Anthony 4; Brothers of Mercy 4; and 149 foundations conducted by twenty-five orders and congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymites</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, Sorores de Patrocinio, etc. Among the churches the most important is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Palma called La Leo, an enormous edifice built in gothic style, begun during the reign of James I and not completed until 1601; in 1905 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was raised to the rank of a minor basilica. The most frequented places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are the shrines of <a href="../cathen/13450b.htm">San Salvador</a>, Nostra Se&ntilde;ora de Lluch, and the Santuario del Puig de Pollenza.

<p>The Diocese of Iviza nominally united with Majorca, but in reality ruled by its own <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar-capitular</a>, contains 26,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 22 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 26 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, about 50 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10332a.htm">Diocese of Minorca</a> embraces the island of that name and contains 40,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 23 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 80 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, about 102 secular and 6 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, an episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, at Ciudadela, an Instuto de segunda ensenanza at Mahon, 35 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 3 benevolent institutions conducted by the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, viz: a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and a <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling asylum</a> at Mahon, and a <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling asylum</a> at Ciudadela. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built in 1287 on the site of a mosque, and having been partially destroyed in 1628, was restored in 1719. In 1795 it was raised to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.
