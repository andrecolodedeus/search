<h1>Balsam</h1>  

<p>Balsam is an oily, resinous, and odorous substance, which flows spontaneously or by incision from certain plants, and which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> mixes with olive oil for use as <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>. Balsams are very widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom, being particularly abundant in the pine <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, but the name is generally restricted in the present day to resins which in addition to a volatile oil contain benzoic and cinnamic acid. Among the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> balsams are the Balm of Gilead, or Mecca, which is cultivated in <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, etc., and is extremely costly; the copaiva balsam, and those of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> and Tolu &mdash; all three found chiefly in South America. The term <em>balsam</em>, however, is also applied to many pharmaceutical preparations and resinous substances which possess a balsamic odour.

<p>The practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of using balsam, as mentioned above, is very ancient, going back possibly to Apostolic times. (See <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">CHRISM</a>.) The scarcity and high price of other perfumes has <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> to be content with balm alone in the mixture of <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">holy chrism</a>; but in the East, where the climate is more favourable than ours to the growth of these plants, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> uses no less than thirty-six species of precious perfumes, according to the Euchologion, in the oil, which makes it an ointment of exquisite fragrance. The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> does not insist on the quantity or the quality of the balsam to be used; any substance commonly known as a balsam may be utilized, and such a quantity as will give its odour to the oil is sufficient. This mingling of the balsam with the oil is intended to convey, by outward sign, the good odour of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of whom it is written (Cantic., i, 3): "We will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments." It typifies also the odour of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, the thought which ought to inspire those who worthily receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; and it symbolizes an innocent life and the gifts of the Holy Spirit.

<p>The balsam is blessed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the Mass which he solemnly celebrates on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> and is poured into the oil after he has administered <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a> of balsam is brought by a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> to the assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who in turn places it on a table in the sanctuary before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The latter <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the balsam, reciting over it the three <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> found in the Roman Pontifical: he calls it the fragrant tear of dry bark &mdash; the oozing of a favoured branch that gives us the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> unction. Later he mixes the balsam with a little oil on a <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> and pours it into the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a> with a suitable invocation: "May this mixture of liquors be to those who shall be anointed with it, a propitiation and a salutary protection for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>."

<p>In the early ages the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, without using any form, as appears from the Roman <em>Ordines</em>, poured the balsam into the oil, while still in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> before Mass (Ordo Romanus, X, n. 3; P.L., LXXVIII, 1010.), but the blessing took place after the Communion of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and before that of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the faithful (Duchesne, Christian Worship, 2d Eng. ed., 305, 306, 467). According to the Gregorian Sacramentary (Muratori, ed., P.L., LXXVIII, 330), however, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> mixes the balsam and oil during the Mass. In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, at one time, the "Veni Creator" was sung before the mingling of the balsam and oil.
