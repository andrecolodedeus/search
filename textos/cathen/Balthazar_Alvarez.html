<h1>Balthazar Alvarez</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> mystic, who was the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> of <a href="../cathen/14515b.htm">St. Teresa</a>, b. At Cervera, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1533, of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; d. At Belmonte, 25 July, 1580. He studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>. When only eighteen years of age, he was remarkable for his extraordinary habit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. His inclination was first towards the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, because of their life of contemplation, but, finally, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a>, in 1555, fifteen years after its foundation. The famous Father Bustamente was his master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and subjected him to the Alcal&aacute; trials. In the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of Simancas he met <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a>, and the strongest affection was established between them. He resumed his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> and Avila, under the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>; for as yet the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> had no <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of its own. The continual interruptions of his studies impeded his progress in <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a>, but he compensated for it by the eminence he achieved, through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical theology</a>, which fitted him in a remarkable degree for the office he subsequently held as confessor, master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, provincial, visitor, and as director of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> far advance in the ways of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. He was made a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1558, and, although only twenty-five years of age, was entrusted with the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of St. Teresa, then belonging to the mitigated order of Carmel, but who was on the point of founding the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. Alvarez not only guided her in matters of the spirit, but defended her from her critics, encouraged her in her work of reform, and had much to do with framing the rules of the new Order. His direction continued for seven years. The Saint declared that it had been revealed to her that Father Balthazar had reached a very high degree of perfection. He followed the usual method of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for sixteen years. After that he received a special gift of contemplation. In 1574 he was made <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Salamanca and visitor of the Province of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, and, in 1579, was about to be sent as provincial to <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> but that project was never carried out. He was well on in life when his method of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was questioned. By some it was looked upon as a delusion of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Alvarez was compelled to write an account of it to the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, Everard Mercurian, who approved of it, but discountenanced it as a general practice. At the same time, he expressed his esteem for Father Alvarez and employed him in the most responsible offices. At his death, St. Teresa had a revelation of his glory in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.
