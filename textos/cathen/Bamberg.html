<h1>Bamberg</h1>  

<p>The Archdiocese of Bamberg, in the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, embraces almost the whole of the presidency of Upper Franconia, the northern part of Middle Franconia (in particular the cities of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, Furth, Ansbach, and Erlangen), parts of Lower Franconia, of the Upper Palatinate, and of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg. According to the census of 1 December, 1900, the archdiocese then contained 379,442 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; in 1907 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> numbered 410,000 and members of other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> 720,000. Bamberg as an <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> includes, besides the Archdiocese of Bamberg, the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>, and Speyer, all of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>In the early centuries the region afterwards included in the Diocese of Bamberg was inhabited for the most part by <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>; the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was brought to these people chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, and the land was under the spiritual authority of the <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">Diocese of W&uuml;rzburg</a>. The Emperor Henry II and his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> wife Kunigunde decided to erect a separate <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> at Bamberg, which was a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> inheritance. The emperor's purpose in this was to make the <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">Diocese of W&uuml;rzburg</a> less unwieldy in size and to give <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> a firmer footing in the districts of Franconia. In 1008, after long negotiations with the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> and Eichst&auml;tt, who were to cede portions of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the boundaries of the new diocese were defined, and <a href="../cathen/08429a.htm">John XVIII</a> granted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation in the same year. The new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 6 May, 1012, and in 1017 Henry II founded on Mount St. Michael, near Bamberg, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> for the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The emperor and his wife gave large temporal possessions to the new diocese, and it received many privileges out of which grew the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (cf. Weber in "Historisches Jahrbuch der Gorresgesellschaft" for 1899, 326-345 and 617-639). <a href="../cathen/02428e.htm">Pope Benedict VIII</a> during his visit to Bamberg (1020) placed the diocese in direct dependence on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1248 and 1260 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> obtained large portions of the estates of the Counts of Meran, partly through purchase and partly through the appropriation of extinguished fiefs. The old Bishopric of Bamberg was composed of an unbroken territory extending from Schlusselfeld in a north-easterly direction to the Franconian Forest, and possessed in addition estates in the Duchies of Carinthia and Salzburg, in the Nordgau (the present Upper Palatinate), in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, and on the Danube. By the changes resulting from the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the territory of this see was reduced nearly one half in extent; in 1759 the possessions and jurisdictions situated in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> were sold to that State. When the secularization of church lands took place (1802) the diocese covered 1276 square miles and had a population of 207,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>Up to this period the Diocese of Bamberg had been ruled by 63 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The first eight were appointed by the German emperors; after this they were chosen by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people jointly; still later they were elected by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. On several occasions, when the election was disputed, the appointment was made by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Eberhard I (1007-40), chancellor to Henry II, greatly increased the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Suidger (1040-46) became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/04017a.htm">Clement II</a>; Hartwig (1047-53) defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> and received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1053; Adalbero (1053-57) was followed by Gunther (1057-65) who held the first synod of Bamberg (1058). Gunther died at Odenburg (Sopron) in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, while on a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. Hermann (1065-75) acquired the Principality of Banz; in the struggle between the empire and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> he took the side of the empire. He was charged with obtaining his election by <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and deposed. Rupert (1075-1102), as partisan of Henry IV, was a member of the pseudo-Synod of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a> which declared <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a> to be deposed; on this account the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. During his episcopate Rupert did much for the encouragement of classical learning in the diocese. St. Otto I (1102039), the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> and Pomeranians, had a large share in the reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor by the Concordat of Worms; he founded numerous churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and during a famine showed large-hearted generosity to his subjects. Otto's immediate successors were men of less distinction: Egilbert (1139-46), who had been <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>; Eberhard II of Otelingen (1146-70) who with great pomp celebrated, in 1147, the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Henry II. Eberhard increased the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but, being a partisan of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick I</a>, he was for a time under sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. He was succeeded by Hermann II, of Aucach (1170-77). <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, of Andechs (1177-96), rebuilt in 1181 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which had been burned. <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> understood how to remain loyal both to the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Thiemo (1196-1202) obtained in 1200 the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of the Empress Kunigunde, joint foundress with the emperor Henry II of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>; Conrad, Duke of Silesia (1201-03), died soon after his election; Eckbert, Count of Meran and Andechs (1203-37), was suspected of being privy to the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of King Philip of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1208; the ban of the empire was proclaimed against him, and he was removed form his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, but in 1212 he was restored, and in 1217 took part in an unsuccessful <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to Palestine. In spite of his warlike disposition he was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in promoting the spiritual life of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Poppo I, Count of Andechs (1237-42), soon retired from his office; Henry I of Bilberstein (1242-51) received from the emperor the title of Prince-Bishop for himself and his successors, as well as numerous <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of sovereignty. Thenceforth the Bishops of Bamberg had <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> precedence directly after the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>.



<p>Their power was encroached on, however, from two directions; on the one side by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons, the so-called Brothers of St. George, who abandoned the <em>vita communis</em> during the episcopate of Bishop Berthold of Leiningen (1257-85) and developed gradually into a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. In time the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of Bamberg was chosen, as in other German <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, exclusively from the nobility; the chapter, by so-called election pacts (<em>Wahlkapitulationen</em>) forced the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to abandon numerous privileges and many of the church livings under their control in favour of the chapter, limited the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> disciplinary authority over the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as well as his right to levy taxes, and abridged other powers. The episcopal authority was also limited, as in other parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, by the growing power of the towns which rebelled against the secular <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> princes. Thus the city of Bamberg revolted (1291) against Arnold of Solms (1286-96), a quarrel which was settled in 1291 by arbitration in favour of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. During this episcopate the finances of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> became much involved, and the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> increased under Leopold I of Grundlach (1297-1303). A <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Wulfing of Stubenberg (1304-18), founded in Bamberg a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Several of the succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> ruled for brief periods: John of Guttingen (1322-23), afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Friesing; Henry II of Sternberg (1324-28), a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>; John, Count of Nassau (1328-29), who died before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; Werntho Schenk of Reicheneck (1320-35); Leopold II of Egloffstein 91335-43), who maintained <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and shrewdly kept out of the quarrels between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor. Frederick I of Hohenlohe (1344-52) did much to establish peace between the imperial and <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>; in 1348 he had a register (<em>urbarium</em>) drawn up of all the estates and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Leopold III of Bebenburg (1353-63) was granted the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> and re-established the disordered finances of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of Truhendingen (1364-66) was followed by Louis, Margrave of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> (1366-74), who soon became Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. Lamprecht of <a href="../cathen/03011c.htm">Br&uuml;nn</a> (1374-98), formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, imposed new taxes in order to reduce the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. This led to a revolt of the citizens of Bamberg, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was put to flight in 1379; in 1380 he conquered the city and imposed heavy penalties upon it. Albert, Count of Wertheim (1399-1421), settled a quarrel of many years' standing with the Burgrave of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> and protected the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> living in the diocese. Frederick III of Aufsess (1421-31), one of the most religious princes of his age, convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> in order to restore <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and to check the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and immorality of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the opposition to these reforms, especially that of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons, forced him to resign the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> (d. 1440). Anthony of Rotenhan (1432-59) was unable to improve the bad condition of the episcopal finances of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>; in 1440 the citizens of Bamberg forced him to flee, but he soon afterwards took the city by storm and executed a number of the citizens. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was several times devastated by <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>. More peaceful times now followed: George I of Schaumberg (1459-75), an able ruler, restored <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> among the people, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and encouraged the newly discovered art of printing (the printer Pfister had a press at Bamberg as early as 1460). Philip of Henneberg (1475-87) continued the labours of his predecessor, redeemed a large number of the estates mortgaged by Anthony of Rotenhan to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and in 1478 drove the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> out of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Henry III Gross of Tockau (1487-1501) was an energetic organizer and issued a number of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; in 1491 he held a synod. Veit I Truchsess of Pommersfelden (1501-03) and George II Marschalk of Ebnet (1503-05) had very brief reigns.

<p>The period of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was an unfortunate one for the diocese. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> doctrines very soon found entrance into its territory. The fortieth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, George III Schenk of <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a> (1502-22), did much to encourage art and the erection of churches, but he showed himself weak in his opposition to the religious innovations and allowed the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> to be printed and spread in the diocese. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> doctrines also found friends and well-wishers in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. Weigand of Redwitz (1522-56) desired to make a stand against the progress of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, but was prevented by political and social conflicts. In 1524 the peasants, excited by the preaching of evangelical freedom by the adherents of the new teachings, revolted in several places and refused to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. The city of Bamberg also rebelled against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; the citizens called on the peasants for aid, plundered the episcopal palace, the houses of the canons and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and a large number of estates in the open country which belonged to the nobles and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Geoerge von Truchsess, commander of the army of the Swabian Confederation, restored order; a number of the revolutionary leaders were executed, a heavy punishment was inflicted on the city of Bamberg, and the nobles who had suffered loss received unnecessarily large compensation. In spite of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> spread through the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> gained a footing, especially in <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> and in the Franconian possessions of the Electors of Brandenburg. This period was followed by an era of calm during the episcopates of George IV Fuchs von Rugheim (1556-61), Veit II of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (1561-77), John George I Zobel of Giebelstadt (1577-80), Martin von Eyb (1580-83); none of these men, however, were able to correct abuses and reduce the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was chiefly responsible for the troubles under which the diocese suffered; their nepotism, <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, avoidance of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and, in many cases, their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lives (concubinage was common) prevented reform. Ernst von Mengersdorf (1583-91) took energetic measures against the moral decay of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people; in 1585 he founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in Bamberg for the training of priests; he also did much to improve the material welfare of the people. Neithart von Thungen (1591-98) laboured with great success in behalf of the counter-Reformation; he provided for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, enlarged the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>, and re-established the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in his territory in accordance with the then accepted principles of law. A less successful episcopate was that of John Philip von Gebsattel (1599-1609), during whose reign the pest desolated the diocese. John Gottfried von Aschhausen (1609-22), who, after 1617, was also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, took energetic measures against <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a> among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In 1612 he called in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, to whom he gave the house and church of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>; he put the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in charge of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> and made them the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> preachers. In this way the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> insured the reform of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the spiritual renewal of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. There is one stain on his memory which also rests on that of his successor: the toleration and encouragement of trials for <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>.

<p>Many misfortunes befell the diocese during the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>; among those were heavy <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> imposts, spoliation, and devastation. In 1632 Bamberg was conquered by the Swedes, and in 1633 was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recognize Barnard of Weimar as its ruler. Bishop John George II Fuchs von Dornheim (1623-33) died in Carinthia far away from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Franz von Hatzfeld (1633-42) was not able to enter his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> until 1635. Melchior Otto Voit of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> (1642-53) changed the gymnasium into a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1647; his successors, Philip Valentine Voit von Reineck (1655-72), Philip von Dernbach (1672-83), Marquard Sebastian Schenk von Stauffenberg (1683-93), followed his example in encouraging the spiritual activity of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and other orders, in the improvement of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and in reducing the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. A time of great prosperity was the period of the two Counts von Sch&ouml;nborn, Lothair Franz (1693-1729), and Frederick Charles (1729-46). After 1695 the former of these two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Lothair Franz, was elected Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; he built the prince-bishop's palace (now a royal residence), a large college for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, as well as several castles, and was a great patron of art and learning; the latter, Frederick Charles, added faculties of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and medicine to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and adorned the city with numerous public buildings. On account of his <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> eloquence his contemporaries gave him the name of the German Fleury. The reigns of the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, John Philip Anthony von Frankenstein (1746-53) and Franz Conrad, Count von Stadion (1753-57), were also peaceful. During the administration of Adam Frederick, Count von Seinsehim (1757-79), the diocese suffered greatly from the Seven Years War; during its progress the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> ravaged and plundered the region, levied contributions on the inhabitants, and carried off the church treasures. When pestilence and famine followed the other miseries of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> showed great liberality in providing for his starving subjects. Franz Ludwig von Erthal (1779-95), who was at the same time <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, was another <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who aimed to promote the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; he issued wise <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> tried to equalize the burdens of taxation, founded <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> (the general <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Bamberg among them), and raised the standard of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. But although personally religious, in the political relations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he yielded in a measure to the prevailing tendencies of the <em>Aufklarung</em> (illumination) movement of his day. Christoph Franz von Buseckj (1745-1802) was the last Prince-Bishop of Bamberg. In 1796 he took refuge at Prague from the French invasion, and in 1799 at Saalfeld. He had only just returned, in 1802, when <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> seized his prince-bishopric; and in 1803 the delegates of the empire formally enacted the secularization of Bamberg, and allotted it to be a possession of the Elector of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. All the provostships and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were then suppressed, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was changed into the still extant lyceum, and the prince-bishop was pensioned.

<p>Upon the death of von Buseck (1805) George Charles von Fechenbach, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, administered the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> until 1808. After this the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for ten years; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government was carried on by a vicariate-general, consisting of a president and eight counsellors. The concordat agreed upon between <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1817 brought in a new era. Bamberg was made an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> with boundaries as given at the beginning of this article. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Count Joseph von Stubenberg, previously Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>, took possession of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> of Bamberg in 1818 and administered both <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> until his death in 1824. Bishop von Stubenberg deserves great credit for the manner in which he protected the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was followed by (1824-52) Joseph Maria, Freiherr von Fraunberg, who had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, (1842-58) Boniface Caspar von Urban, (1858-75) Michael von Deinlein, who founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys and encouraged <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations and missions among the people, (1875-90) Frederick von Schreiber, and (1890-1904) Joseph von Schork, a noted <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator. Archbishop von Schork promoted missions (<em>Volksmissionen</em>) among the people, as well as charitable and social organizations among <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Frederick Philip von Abert (b. at Munnerstadt, 1 May, 1852) was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, 30 January, 1905.

<p>The most important <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> building of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The edifice erected by the Emperor Henry II, the Saint, was destroyed by fire in 1081; the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, built by <a href="../cathen/11353a.htm">St. Otto</a> of Bamberg, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1111, and in the thirteenth century received its present late-Romanesque form. It is about 309 feet long, 92 feet broad, 85 feet high, and the four towers are each about 266 feet high. Among the finest of its monuments is that to the Emperor Henry II and his Empress Kunigunde, considered the masterpiece of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> <a href="../cathen/13052b.htm">Tilman Riemenschneider</a>. Among other noteworthy churches of the city are the twelfth-century church of the former <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of St. Michael and the upper <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, a Gothic building <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1387.
