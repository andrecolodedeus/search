<h1>Bangor</h1>  

<p>(Bangorium, Bangoriensis)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; anciently known as Bangor Vawr, situated in Carnarvonshire on the Menai Straits, must be distinguished from Bangor Iscoed also in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and the celebrated <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bangor in County Down. The foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is traditionally ascribed to St. Daniel or Deiniol (d. 584?) who is stated to have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by St. Dubricius, or, according to others, St. David. Some writers place his death in 544, others in 554, while the tenth century "Annales Cambriae" assign it to 584. Yet even this date is regarded by recent research as too early. We may, perhaps, safely ascribe the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to the close of the sixth century. The history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> before the Norman Conquest is so obscure that Godwin (De praesulibus Angliae, 1743) does not allow that there were any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at all before the coming of the Normans.

<p>In 1092 Hervey, a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> in the court of William Rufus, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bangor and in the same year was present in that capacity at the council held by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, being the first <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to attend an English council. His rule was not successful, for difficulties arose owing to his people resenting the coming of a stranger <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of their language, customs, and character. He, on the other hand, adopted violent measures in the assertion of his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, with the result that bloodshed ensued, and he finally had to take refuge in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he was translated to the <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">See of Ely</a> in 1108. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> had been destroyed by the Normans in 1071, but was subsequently rebuilt, though no trace of Norman work remains in the present structure. Anian (1267-1305), who, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bangor, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Edward II took the chief part in rebuilding the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He also draw up the "Missale in usum Ecclesiae Banchorensis" and the "Pontifical" which represent the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of "the use of Bangor". It again suffered severely in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> between the English and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> during the reign of Henry III, and in 1402 was entirely burnt down by Owen Glendower. There could hardly have been a vigorous <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> life, for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and episcopal residence lay in ruins for nearly a century. At length in 1496, a vigorous administrator became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Henry Deane, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin canons</a> at <a href="../cathen/09316a.htm">Llanthony</a> near Gloucester. He immediately began to rebuild the ruined choir and his work still exists. Besides restoring his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, he was active in regaining the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> which had been annexed by the more powerful men in the neighbourhood. Unfortunately for Bangor after four years' rule he was in 1500 translated first to <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, and afterwards to Canterbury. He is said to have left his <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> and <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, both of great value, to his successor, on condition that he should proceed with the rebuilding.

<p>But neither of the next two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Thomas Pigot, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Chertsey (1500-03), and John Penny (1504-08), did anything for the fabric. On the translation of Bishop Penny to <a href="../cathen/03349b.htm">Carlisle</a>, Bangor was entrusted to Thomas Skevington, or Pace (1509-33), who of all its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> did most for it. He was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Beaulieu in Hampshire, and though he did not reside in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, he showed practical interest in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by completing the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He rebuilt the entire <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and tower, and presented four bells which were afterwards sold by the first "reforming" <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He also rebuilt the episcopal residence. He died in 1533, and after the short episcopates of John Capon (1534-39) and John Bird (1539-41), was followed by Arthur Bulkeley, who resided in the diocese indeed, but who is accused of having neglected it in his own interests. According to the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> historian, Godwin, he was struck blind while watching the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> bells, which he had sold, being shipped off. But this story is questioned by Brown Willis, the historian of the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>. Bulkeley died in 1553, and was succeeded by William Glynn (1553-58) the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>Since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> has continued to serve the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in its old capacity, while also doing <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> as the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of the town. It is the smallest and humblest of all the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> or <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, being an embattled cruciform structure resembling a good-sized <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. The diocese consisted of the whole of Anglesea and Carnarvonshire, with the greater part of Merionethshire and some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the counties Denbigh and Montgomery. There were three archdeaconries, Bangor, Anglesea, and Merioneth. The arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were gules, a bend, or gutty de poix between two mullets, argent.
