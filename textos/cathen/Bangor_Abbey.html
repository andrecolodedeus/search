<h1>Bangor Abbey</h1>  

<p>The name of two famous <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> establishments in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>(1) The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Abbey of Bangor was situated in the County Down, on the southern shore of Belfast Lough. Sometimes the name was written "Beannchor", from the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> word <em>beann</em>, a horn. According to Keating, a king of Leinster once had cattle killed there, the horns being scattered round, hence the name. The place was also called the Vale of Angels, because, says Jocelin, <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> once rested there and saw the valley filled with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The founder of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a>, born in Antrim in 517, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Clooneenagh and Clonmacnoise. The spirit of monasticism was then strong in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Many sought solitude the better to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with this object Comgall retired to a lonely island. The persuasions of his friends drew him from his retreat; later on he founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bangor, in 559. Under his rule, which was rigid, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> were incessant. But these austerities attracted rather than repelled; crowds came to share his penances and his vigils; they also came for learning, for Bangor soon became the greatest <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Ulster. Within the extensive rampart which encircled its monastic buildings, the Scriptures were expounded, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> taught, and geometry, and arithmetic, and music; the beauties of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> classics were appreciated, and two at least of its students wrote good Latin verse. Such was its rapid rise that its pupils soon went forth to found new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and when, in 601, <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a> died, 3,000 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> looked up for light and guidance to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bangor.

<p>With the Danes came a disastrous change. Easily accessible from the sea, Bangor invited attack, and in 824 these pirates plundered it, killed 900 of its <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, treated with indignity the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a>, and then carried away his shrine. A succession of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> continued, but they were <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> only in name. The lands passed into the hands of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, the buildings crumbled, and when <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a>, in the twelfth century, became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bangor he had to build everything anew. The impress of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> might have had lasting results had he continued in this position. But he was promoted to the See of Down, and Bangor again decayed. By the Statute of Kilkenny the "mere <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>" were excluded from it, though it did not prosper thereby. In 1469, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> had possession of it, and a century later the Augustinians, after which, at the <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">dissolution of the monasteries</a> in that part of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, it was given by James I to James Hamilton, created Viscount Clandeboye. An irregular succession of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> was still kept up, the last being Abbot MacCormack, who lived in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but, returning to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> during the Reign of Terror, found a refuge at <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a> and died there in the early years of the nineteenth century.

<p>Among the Abbots of Bangor few acquired fame, but many of the students did. Findchua has his life written in the Book of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>; Luanus founded 100 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/03384c.htm">St. Carthage</a> founded the great School of <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>. From Bangor Columbanus and Gall crossed the sea, the former to found Luxeuil and Bobbio, the latter to evangelize <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. In the ninth century a Bangor student, Dungal, defended <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> against the Western <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclasts</a>. The present town of Bangor is a thriving little place, popular as a seaside resort. Local tradition has it that some ruined walls near the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church mark the site of the ancient <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; nothing else is left of the place hallowed by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and penances of <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a> and <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a>.

<p>(2) The <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> Abbey of Bangor was situated in Flintshire, not far from <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was often confounded with Bangor in Carnarvonshire, which was an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of its foundation and its founder's name are equally uncertain. With great confidence and evident conviction, <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> declares that its founder was St. Iltud, or Iltyde. But some allowance must be made for French partiality, for Iltud was an Armoric Gaul. His life and acts are narrated in the "Lives of the Cambro-British Saints"; they have been edited by Mr. Rees; and though it is stated that he was an Armorican, and had been a soldier, and married, before he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, it is not said that he was connected with Bangor. It is more probable that the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was founded by Dunawd, a Welshmen, whence it was often called Bangor Dunawd. And if St. Deiniol was the son of Dunawd, as it is said, this would fix the foundation of the Flintshire <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at about the beginning sixth century, for Bangor in Carnarvonshire was founded by St. Deiniol in 514. It would also dispose of the assertion that <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, was at one time its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, for he died long before. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that Bangor was the greatest monastic establishment in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, having at one time 2,000 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The Angles and Saxons had then conquered Britain and had treated the Britons with great severity. A remnant of these latter found refuge in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, where they brooded over their wrongs, and being <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> themselves, refused to preach the Gospel to their conquerors. When <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in the last years of the sixth century, he visited the Britons in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. Their moral condition was then bad; they clung to the <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">old mode of celebrating Easter</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> had also crept into their creed. He had a conference with delegates from Bangor, but they refused to co-operate with him in the work of converting the still unconverted English. In punishment, he predicted that, as they refused to preach the way of life to the English, they would at the hands of these same English suffer death. And this came to pass in 603 when Ethelfrid of Northumbria defeated the Britons near Chester. Hearing that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Bangor were <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for his enemies, he turned aside from the battle and put 1,200 of them to death. Extensive ruins of this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> still remained in the twelfth century, but in Ussher's time, in the seventeenth century, these ruins had all but disappeared. On the site of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> now stands the small town of Bangor-on-the-Dee.
