<h1>Baptismal Vows</h1>  

<p>The name popularly given to the renunciations required of an adult candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> just before the sacrament is conferred. In the case of infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, they are made in the name of the child by the sponsors. It is obvious that these promises have not the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> import of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> properly so called. According to the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, at present in use, three questions are to be addressed to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, as follows: "Dost thou renounce <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>? and all his works? and all his pomps?" To each of these interrogation the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or the sponsor in his name, replies: "I do renounce". The practice of demanding and making this formal renunciation seems to go back to the very beginnings of organized <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> among the Latins and <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> among the Greeks are at one in reckoning it as a usage which, although not explicitly warranted in the Scriptures, is nevertheless <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a venerable tradition. St. Basil says this tradition ascends from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, in his "De Coron&acirc;", appears to hint at a twofold renunciation as common in his time, one which was made at the moment of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and another made sometime before, and publicly in the church, in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The form of this renunciation a found in the Apostolic Constitutions (VIII, 4) has a quaint interest. It is as follows: "Let therefore the candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> declare thus in his renunciation: 'I renounce <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and his works and his pomps and his worship and his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">angels</a> and his inventions and all things that are under him'. And after his renunciation let him in his consociation say: 'And I associate myself to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and believe and am <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into one unbegotten being'", etc.

<p>Where there was a <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> the renunciations were made in the <em>proaulion oikon</em>, the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> or ante-room, as distinguished from the <em>esoteron oikon</em>, the inner room where the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself was administered. The <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>, standing with his face to the West, which symbolized the abode of darkness, and stretching out his hand, or sometimes spitting out in defiance and abhorrence of the devil, was wont to make this <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a>. It was also customary after this for the candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to make an explicit promise of obedience to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This was called by the Greeks <em>syntassesthai Christo</em>, the giving of oneself over to the control of Christ. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin Martyr</a> testifies that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was only administered by those who, together with their profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, made a promise or <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> that they would live in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> code. Hence the generally employed formula: <em>syntassomai soi, Christe</em>, "I surrender myself to thee, O Christ, to be ruled by thy <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>". This took place directly over the <em>apotaxis</em> or renunciation of the devil, and was variously described by the Latins as <em>promissum, pactum, and votum</em>. During this declaration of attachment to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> turned towards the East as towards the region of light.

<p>The practice of renewing the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> promises is more or less widespread. This is done under circumstances of special solemnity such as at the closing exercises of a mission, after the administration of First Communion to children, or the conferring of the Sacrament of Confirmation. It is thus intended as a way of reaffirming one's loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> taken over by membership in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>.
