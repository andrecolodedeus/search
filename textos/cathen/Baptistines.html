<h1>Baptistines</h1>  

<p>I. Hermits of St. John the Baptist. II. Missionaries of St. John the Baptist. III. Sisterhood of St. John the Baptist.

<p>I. The Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a> of St. John the Baptist of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was founded about 1630 by Brother Michel de Saint-Sabine who reformed and united the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. He established for each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> a visitor who was aided by four majors and a secretary. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> received the religious when they took the habit and made their profession, and the brothers in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> met together once a year. The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> reformer gave the congregation a collection of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> which regulated their mode of life. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to make these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> (1633), and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> (1634). Brother Jean-Baptiste who had a great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for virtue carried this reform into the Dioceses of Vienne, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, Louis-Armand de Simiane de Gardes, added in 1680, for the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, several ordinances to those of Brother Michel. He established four visitors, one for each division of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the brothers wore a white habit to distinguish them from vagrant and lax <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>. Brother Jean-Baptiste went to the <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Diocese of Angers</a> to found the hermitage of Gardelles; and died there in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, 24 December, 1691.

<p>II. The congregation of missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of St. John the Baptist, called Baptistines, was founded by a <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>, Domenico Olivieri. He began by uniting several <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with himself for the evangelization of the people of the cities and country. His plan of forming from this company an association the members of which should devote their time especially to missions was encouraged by Cardinal Spinola and the scheme afterwards received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed the new congregation in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 23 September, 1755, and placed it under the control of the Cardinal Prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. The institute had a house and an oratory at Tome near the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Isidoro, and the members held missions in the different churches of the city and in the surrounding country. The <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, realizing their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and virtue, wished to employ them in distant missions. A number of them were, therefore, sent to <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; some became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Foreign missions did not absorb all their activity, for a number were employed in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, two, Father Imperiali and Father Spinelli becoming <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The only <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> imposed by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> founder were those of continuance in the congregation and readiness to go to missions to which the members should be sent by the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. Olivieri died at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, 13 June, 1766. His <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> disappeared during the troubles which overwhelmed <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at the end of the eighteenth century.

<p>III. The Baptistines, or <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> sisters of St. John the Baptist, had as their founder Giovanna Maria Baptista Solimani. In 1730, when she was forty-two years old, she gathered her first companions together at Moneglia, not far from <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. The congregation intended to lead a life of penitence in imitation of the precursor of Christ and under his patronage. All the choir sisters, therefore, added to their names in religion that of Baptista in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of their illustrious model. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, Father <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, aided them by his advice during the drawing up of their constitutions. Soon after, Providence gave them the direction of the saintly <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Olivieri, the cause of whose <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> has been introduced. Shortly after taking Olivieri as their director the founder now went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain the confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; through the aid of the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite</a>, Mario Maccabei, the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a> was obtained in 1744. Two years later, 20 April, 1746, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> received the <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> of Giovanna Solimani and her twelve companions. Soon after this, Mother Solimani was elected <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> and governed the house until her death 8 April, 1758. In 1755 the congregation had sent a colony to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> near the church of San Nicola da Tolentino. Houses were also founded in some of the other cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The congregation drew its members from among the young girls and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> who were admitted into their houses as lay-sisters. Tertiaries took care of their churches and gathered the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of which they had need. A rigorous <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> was observed. The sisters rose at midnight for <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, slept in their clothes, went bare-footed, and observed a continual abstinence. The whole life was one of extreme austerity. Several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the congregation still exist in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.
