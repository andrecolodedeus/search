<h1>Bar Hebr&aelig;us</h1>  

<p>(<em>Abu'l Faraj</em>).

<p>A Jacobite Syrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, poet, grammarian, physician, Biblical commentator, historian, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. at Meletine (Malatia), <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, 1226; d. at Maragha, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, 1286. He was the son of a Jewish physician, Aaron, a convert to the Jacobite <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; hence his surname of Bar 'Ebraya (Bar Hebr&aelig;us), "Son of the Hebrew". Under the care of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> he began as a boy (<em>a teneris unguiculis</em>) the study of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> and of many other branches of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which he pursued as a youth at Antioch and Tripoli, and which he never abandoned until his death. In 1246 he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gubos, by the Jacobite Patriarch Ignatius II, and in the following year was transferred to the See of Lacabene. He was placed over the <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Diocese of Aleppo</a> by Dionysius (1252) and finally was made Primate, or Maphrian, of the East by Ignatius III (1264). His episcopal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> did not interfere with his studies; he took advantage of the numerous visitations, which he had to make throughout his vast province, to consult the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> and converse with the learned men whom he happened to meet. Thus he gradually accumulated an immense erudition, became familiar with almost all branches of secular and religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and in many cases thoroughly mastered the bibliography of the various subjects which he undertook to treat. How he could have devoted so much time to such a systematic study, in spite of all the vicissitudes incident to the Mongol invasion, is almost beyond comprehension. The main claim of Bar Hebr&aelig;us to our gratitude is not, however, in his original productions, but rather in his having preserved and systematized the work of his predecessors, either by way of condensation of by way of direct reproduction. Both on account of his virtues and of his <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, Bar Hebr&aelig;us was respected by all, and his death was mourned not only by men of his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but also by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Mar Matthew, near Mosul. He has left us an autobiography, to be found in Assemani, "Biblioth. Orient.", II, 248-263; the account of his death (ibid.) was written by his own brother, Bar Sauma. The works of Bar Hebr&aelig;us are:--
<h2 id="section1">Encyclopedic and philosophical</h2>

<p>(1) His great encyclopedic work is his <em>Hewath Hekhmetha</em>, "The Cream of Science", which deals with almost every branch of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and comprises the whole <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> discipline, after <a href="../cathen/02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> and other Arabian writers. This work, so far, has not been published, with the exception of one chapter, by Margoliouth, in "Analecta Orientalia ad poeticam Aristoteleam" (London, 1887), 114-139. The rest is to be found only in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, preserved at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, London, and elsewhere. (2) <em>Teghrath Teghratha</em>, "Commerce of Commerces", a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the preceding, also unpublished. (3) <em>Kethabha dhe-Bhabhatha</em>, "Book of the Pupils of the Eyes"; compendium of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and dialectics. (4) <em>Kethabha dhe-Sewadh Sophia</em>, "Book of Speech of Wisdom"; compendium of physics and <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>. To these should be added a few translations of Arabic works into Syriac, as well as some treatises written directly in Arabic.
<h2 id="section2">Biblical</h2>

<p>The most important work of Bar Hebr&aelig;us is <em>Aucar Raze</em>, "Storehouse of Secrets", a commentary on the entire Bible, both <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and critical. Before giving his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> exposition of a passage, he first considers its critical state. Although he uses the Peshitto as a basis, he knows that it is not perfect, and therefore controls it by the Hebrew, the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, the Greek versions of Symmachus, Theodotion, Aquilla, by Oriental versions, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> and Coptic, and finally by the other Syriac translations, Heraclean, Philoxenian and especially Syro-Hexapla. the work of Bar Hebr&aelig;us is of prime importance for the recovery of these versions and more specially for the <a href="../cathen/07316a.htm">Hexapla</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, of which the Syro-Hexapla is a translation by Paul of Tella. His <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> portions are taken from the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and previous Syrian Jacobite <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. No complete edition of the work has yet been issued, but many individual books have been published at different times. (See bibliography at the end of article.)
<h2 id="section3">Historical</h2>

<p>Bar Hebr&aelig;us has left a large historical work called <em>Makhtbhanuth Zabhne</em>, "Chronicon", in which he considers the history from the Creation down to his own day. It is divided into two portions: the first deals with political and civil history and is known as the "Chronicon Syriacum"; the second, "Chronicon Ecclesiasticum", comprising the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a>, begins with Aaron and treats in a first section of the history of the Western Syrian Church and the Patriarchs of Antioch, while a second section is devoted to the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarchs, and the Jacobite Maphrians. Bar Hebr&aelig;us utilized almost all that had been written before him. The best edition of the "Chronicon Syriacum" is that of Bedjan, "Gregorii Barhebr&aelig;i Chronicon Syriacum" (Paris, 1890). The best edition of the "Chronicon Ecclesiasticum" is that of <a href="../cathen/01007d.htm">Abbeloos</a> and Lamy (3 vols., Louvain, 1872-77). The "Chronicon Syriacum" was rendered into Arabic by Bar Hebr&aelig;us himself under the name of "History of Dynasties"; the latest and the best edition of his work is that of Salhani (Beirut, 1890).
<h2 id="section4">Theological</h2>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> Bar Hebr&aelig;us was a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>. He probably, however, thought that the differences between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, and the rest were of a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, but not of dogmatical nature, and that they did not affect the common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; hence, he did not consider others as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and was not himself considered as such, at least by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. In this field, we have from him <em>Menarath Qudhshe</em>, "Lamp of the Sanctuary", and the <em>Kethabha dhe-Zalge</em>, "Book of Rays", a summary of the first. These works have not been published, and exist in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, London, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">Ascetical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> were also treated by Bar Hebr&aelig;us, and we have from him <em>Kethabha dhe-Ithiqon</em>, "Book of Ethics", and <em>Kethabha dhe-Yauna</em>, "Book of the Dove", an ascetical guide. Both have been edited by Bedjan in "Ethicon seu Moralia Gregorii Barhebr&aelig;i" (Paris and Leipzig, 1898). The "Book of the Dove" was issued simultaneously by Cardahi (Rome, 1898). Bar Hebr&aelig;us codified the juridical texts of the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, in a collection called <em>Kethabha dhe-Hudhaye</em>, "Book of Directions", edited by Bedjan, "Barhebr&aelig;i Nomocanon" (Paris, 1898). A Latin translation is to be found in <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a>, "Scriptorum Veter. Nova Collectio", vol. X. Bar Hebr&aelig;us has left besides many other works. On grammatical subjects we have the "Book of Splendours" and "Book of the Spark", both edited by Martin, "Oeuvres grammaticales de Aboul Faradj dit Barhebr&aelig;us" (2 vols., Paris, 1872); also works on mathematics, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, cosmography, medicine, some of which have been published, but others exist only in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>.
