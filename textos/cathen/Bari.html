<h1>Bari</h1>  

<p>An archdiocese situated in the province of the same name, in Apulia, Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city of Bari is the principal city in the province, with a population of about 65,000, and is located on a peninsula which extends into the Adriatic. Anciently called Barium, it fell into the power of the Romans after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Pyrrhus, retaining, however, its autonomy. Being a seaport facing the Orient, Bari must have received <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. According to a local tradition, St. Peter himself preached the Gospel there and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. History, however, is silent as to the beginning of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in this city.

<p>The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bari was Gervasius, who, in 347, assisted at the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a>. In 530 Bishop Peter held the title of Metropolitan under Epiphanius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. In 780 Bishop Leontius was present at the Seventh Oecumenical Council, the Second of Nicaea. In the ninth century the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> laid waste Apulia, destroyed the city of Canosa (Canusium) and captured Bari. In 841, however, the Byzantine army reconquered Bari, and in 844 St. Angelarius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Canosa, then in ruins, brought to Bari the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Sts. Rufinus, Memorus, and Sabinus, which he had rescued from the ruins. <a href="../cathen/13728c.htm">Pope Sergius II</a> conferred on him the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Bari and Canosa, a title which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Bari retain to the present time. In 933 <a href="../cathen/08426a.htm">Pope John XI</a> granted the Bishops of Bari the use of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. It seems that the Bishops were dependent on the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople until the tenth century. Giovanni II (952) was able to withdraw from this influence, refusing to accept the prescriptions of the patriarch concerning <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> points. All connection was finally severed in the eleventh century, and Bari became a direct dependency of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Archbishop Bisanzio (1025) obtained form the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the privilege of consecrating his suffragans; he also began the construction of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was continued by his successors, Nicolo (1035), Andrea (1062), and Elia (1089), the last-named a member of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>.

<p>In 1097 some Bari sailors, on their return from the East, brought with them the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">Mira</a>, for which Roger, Duke of Apulia, built a splendid church; this became the object of great veneration and of innumerable <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>. About this time <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, being in Apulia, went to Bari to venerate the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the holy wonder-worker and to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the basilica. Here also he held a council, attended by 183 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to consider the reunion of the Greeks with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a> distinguished himself at this council by his learned defence of the procession of the Holy Ghost and the use of unleavened bread for the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. Another council had been held at Bari in 1064, presided over by Arnoldo, Vicar of <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>. Of the later provincial councils that of 1607 is worthy of mention. In the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Diocese of Bitetto was suppressed and made a part of the Diocese of Bari. The suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> under Bari are: Conversano, Rufo, and Bitonto.

<p>The most celebrated religious edifice of Bari is the church of San Nicolo, one of the most beautiful examples of Norman architecture. It consists of an upper and a <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">lower</a> church, both richly adorned with precious marbles. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to the Assumption, is likewise remarkable for the two high bell towers with which it is flanked.

<p>The most celebrated <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Bari, in addition to those already mentioned, are: Romualdo Grisoni (1280), distinguished for his restorations of churches; Bartolomeo Prignano (1377), later <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Pope Urban VI</a>, who, however, never saw this see; Ascanio Gesualdo (1613), who gave a wonderful example of charity in the earthquake of 1632; Diego Sersale (1638), who at his own expense rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the episcopal palace, and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Tommaso Maria, of the Dukes of Bagnara (1684), who died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>.

<p>The Diocese of Bari contains a population of 300,400. It contains 7 rural deaneries, 33 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 260 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, 250 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 110 seminarists, 30 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 34 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, 200 members of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> congregations, 45 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, 35 for girls.
