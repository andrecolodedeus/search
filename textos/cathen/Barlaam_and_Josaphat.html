<h1>Barlaam and Josaphat</h1>  

<p>The principal characters of a legend of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity, which was a favourite subject of writers in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The story is substantially as follows: Many inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> had been converted by the <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">Apostle St. Thomas</a> and were leading <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> lives. In the third or fourth century King Abenner (Avenier) <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologers</a> had foretold that his son Josaphat would one day become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. To prevent this the prince was kept in close confinement. But, in spite of all precautions, Barlaam, a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> of Senaar, met him and brought him to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Abenner tried his best to pervert Josaphat, but, not succeeding, he shared the government with him. Later Abenner himself became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and, abdicating the throne, became a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>. Josaphat governed alone for a time, then resigned, went into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, found his former teacher Barlaam, and with him spent his remaining years in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Years after their death, the bodies were brought to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and their grave became renowned by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Barlaam and Josaphat found their way into the Roman Martyrology (27 November), and into the Greek calendar (26 August). <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a>, in the thirteenth century, had given the story in his "Speculum Historiale". It is also found in an abbreviated form in the "Golden Legend" of <a href="../cathen/08262b.htm">Jacobus de Voragine</a> of the same century.

<p>The story is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> version of one of the legends of <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddha</a>, as even the name Josaphat would seem to show. This is said to be a corruption of the original Joasaph, which is again corrupted from the middle Persian <em>Budasif</em> (<em>Budsaif=Bodhisattva</em>). Still it is of historical value, since it contains the "Apology" presented by the Athenian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/01712d.htm">Aristides</a> to the Emperor Adrian (or <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a>). The Greek text of the legend, written probably by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Sabbas <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at the beginning of the seventh century, was first published by Boissonade in "Anecdota Graeca" (Paris, 1832), IV, and is reproduced in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., XCVI, among the works of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>. The legend cannot, however, have been a work of the great Damascene, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by Zotenberg in "Notices sur le livre de Barlaam et Josaphat" (Paris, 1886) and by Hammel in "Verhandl. des 7 internat. Orientalisten Congresses", Semit. Section (Vienna, 1888). Another edition of the Greek was made by Kechajoglos (Athens, 1884). From the original Greek a German translation was made by F. Liebrecht (M&uuml;nster, 1847). Latin translations (Minge, P.L., LXXIII), were made in the twelfth century and used for nearly all the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages, in prose, verse and in <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">miracle plays</a>. Among them is prominent the German epic by <a href="../cathen/13219b.htm">Rudolph of Ems</a> in the thirteenth century (K&ouml;nigsberg, 1818, and somewhat later at Leipzig). From the German an <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Icelandic</a> and <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> version were made in the fifteenth century. At Manila the legend appeared in the Tagala language of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. In the East it exists in Syriac, Arabic, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and Hebrew.
