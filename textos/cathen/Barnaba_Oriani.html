<h1>Barnaba Oriani</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite</a> and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, b. at Carignano, near <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 17 July, 1752; d. at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 12 November, 1832. After receiving an elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in his native town, he studied at the College of San Alessandro, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and supported by the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>. He later joined the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>, and, after studying the humanities, physical and mathematical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the age of twenty-three. Specially interested in <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, he was shortly after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> (1776) appointed on the staff of the Observatory of Brera in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. He became assistant <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> in 1778, and director in 1802. In 1778 he began to publish the dissertations on <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> subjects which form an important part of the original memoirs appearing in the "Effemeridi di Milano" during the next fifty-two years. His work soon attracted considerable attention, and in 1785 a notable memoir containing his calculation of the orbit of Uranus and a table of elements for that planet won for him a prominent place among the astronomers of his time. He was admitted to membership in numerous learned <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and offered the position of professor of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, which, however, he did not accept. In the following year he travelled throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> at the expense of the state, visiting the chief observatories. When <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> set up the republic in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, Oriani refused absolutely to swear <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> towards monarchy; the new government modified the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance in his regard, retained him in his position at the observatory, and made him president of the commission appointed to regulate the new system of weights and measures. When the republic was transformed into the Napoleonic kingdom Oriani received the decorations of the Iron Crown and of the Legion of Honour, was made count and senator of the kingdom, and was appointed in company with De Cesaris, to measure the arc of the meridian between the zeniths of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was a devoted friend of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Piazzi, the discoverer of Ceres, and for thirty-seven years cooperated with him in many ways in his <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> labours. Besides his constant contributions to the "Effemeridi di Milano", he published a series of important memoirs on spherical trigonometry (Memorie dell' Istituto Italiano, 1806-10) and the "Istruzione suelle misure e sui pesi" (Milan, 1831).
