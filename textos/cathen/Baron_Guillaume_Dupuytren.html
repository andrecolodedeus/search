<h1>Baron Guillaume Dupuytren</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomist</a> and surgeon, born 6 October, 1777, at Pierre-Buffi&egrave;re, a small town in the Limousin, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 8 February, 1835. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were so <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> that he received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the Coll&egrave;ge de la Marche through charity. By competitive examination he gained the position of prosecutor in <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a> at the newly established Ecole de M&eacute;decine, Paris, when he was but eighteen. In 1803 he was appointed assistant surgeon to the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu. In 1811 he became professor of operative surgery, and in 1815 professor of clinical surgery at the Ecole de M&eacute;decine and head surgeon to the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu. He was indefatigable in his devotion to his profession and had one of the largest surgical practices of all time. He amassed fortune established at $1,5000,000. He succeeded in accomplishing all this in spite of a consumptive tendency against which he had to battle all his life and which finally carried him off. In his will he endowed the chair of <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a> at the Ecole de M&eacute;decine and established a home for physicians in distress. A curious contraction of the fascia of the palm of the hand, which cripples the fingers, is called after him, bears his name. The most important of his writings is his treatise on artificial anus. He published also a treatise on gunshot wounds and clinical lectures on surgery. Dupuytren was not an original investigator in surgical subjects, but he was an excellent observer and a great worker, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to adopt and adapt others' <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> very practically.
