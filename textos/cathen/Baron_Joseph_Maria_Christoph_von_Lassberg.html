<h1>Baron Joseph Maria Christoph von Lassberg</h1>  

<p>A distinguished German antiquary, born at Donaueschingen, 10 April, 1770; died 15 March, 1855. He was descended from a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. His father was chief forester in the service of Prince von F&uuml;rstenberg. After a brief service in the army, he entered the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and later that of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> im Br. to study <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and economics, especially forestry. From 1789 he was in the service of Prince von F&uuml;rstenberg, becoming chief warden of the forests in 1804. Princess Elizabeth, who ruled the principality during the minority of her son Karl Egon, showed him marked favour. He became privy councillor in 1806, and accompanied her on her travels through <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. When the regency ended in 1817, Lassberg resigned his position and retired to private life, residing first on his estate at Eppishusen in Thurgau, and from 1838 at Castle Meersburg on Lake Constance. He now devoted himself <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> to the study of <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German literature</a>, and in the pursuit of these studies he collected a superb <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of upwards of 12,000 books and 273 valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, among which was the codex of the "Nibelungenlied" (known as the Hohenems <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> and commonly designated as C). After his death this <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was presented to the town of Donasueschingen.

<p>Lassberg was very hospitably inclined and many visitors were entertained at Castle Meersburg. Uhland, Lachmann, Gustav Schwab, and other distinguished men of letters were among his friends. He was twice married, his second wife being Maria Anna von Droste-H&uuml;lshoff, a sister of the famous poetess <a href="../cathen/07537a.htm">Annette</a>. His literary work consisted chiefly in editing <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> German poems, many of which were published under the pseudonym of Meister Sepp von Eppishusen. Especially noteworthy is the "Liedersaal", a collection of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> German poems, chiefly of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, of miscellaneous content. It appeared at St. Gall in four volumes. In the fourth volume the above-mentioned Nibelungen <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> was printed for the first time.
