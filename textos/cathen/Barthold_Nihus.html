<h1>Barthold Nihus</h1>  

<p>Convert and controversialist, b. at Holtorf in <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, 7 February, 1590 (according to other sources in 1584 or 1589, at Wolpe in Brunswick); d. at Erfurt, 10 March, 1657. He came from a poor <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, obtained his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at Verden and Goslar, and from 1607 studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and medicine at the University of Helmstedt, where, on account of his poverty, he was the <em>famulus</em> of Cornelius Martini, professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Having become master of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in 1612, his inclinations then led him to study <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Contentions among the professors at Helmstedt made further stay there unpleasant, and when two students of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> went in 1616 to the University of Jena, he accompanied them as preceptor. Later he became instructor of the young princes of Saxe-Weimar among whom was the subsequently famous Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. The inability of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to agree upon vital questions caused him first to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and then to renounce <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. He went to Cologne in 1622, and entered the House of <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">Proselytes</a> founded by the Brotherhood of the Holy Cross; in the same year he accepted the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and, after due preparation, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Chosen director of the House of <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">Proselytes</a>, and in 1627 <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> at Althaldensleben near <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, two years later he became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, from which he was expelled after the battle of Breitenfeld in 1631. He fled to Hildesheim where he became canon of the church of the Holy Cross, thence to <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> where he came into close relation with Gerhard Johann Vossius. In 1645 Nihus was called to Munster by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a>, Fabio Chigi (later <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>), then in Munster attending the <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalian</a> Peace Congress. A few years later he was induced to come to Mayence by Johann Philip von Sch&ouml;nborn, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Mayence, at whose request he went to Ingolstadt in 1654 to obtain information regarding the Welt-Priester-Institut of <a href="../cathen/07439b.htm">Bartholomew Holzhauser</a>, and to report to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Sch&ouml;nborn, in 1655, appointed him his suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for Saxony and Thuringia, with residence in Erfurt, where he died.

<p>After his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> Nihus had sent to the Helmstedt professors, Calixtus and Hornejus, a letter in which he presented his reasons for embracing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; his chief motive was that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> needs a living, supreme judge to explain the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and to settle disputes and difficulties. Calixtus attacked him first in his lectures and later in his writings, whence originated a bitter controversy between Nihus and the Helmstedt professors. The most important of Nihus' numerous writings are: (1) "Ars nova, dicto S. Scripturae unico lucrandi e Pontificiis plurimos in partes Lutheranorum, detecta non nihil et suggesta Theologis Helmstetensibus, Georgio Calixto praesertim et Conrado Hornejo" (Hildesheim, 1633); (2) "Apologeticus pro arte nova contra Andabatam Helmstetensem" (Cologne, 1640), in answer to the response of Calixtus to the first pamphlet: "Digressio de arte nova contra Nihusium"; (3) "Hypodigma, quo diluuntur nonnulla contra Catholicos disputata in Cornelii Martini tractatu de analysi logica" (Cologne, 1648). Assisted by his friend <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Leo Allatius</a> he devoted considerable time to researches pertaining to the "Communion" and the "Missa praesanctificatorum" of the Greeks, and also took charge of the editing and publishing of several works of <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Allatius</a>, some of which &mdash; as the "De Ecclesiae occidentalis et orientalis perpetua consensione" (Cologne, 1648) and "Symmicta" (Cologne, 1653) &mdash; he provided with valuable additions and footnotes.
