<h1>Bartholomew</h1>  

<p>"APOSTLE OF ARMENIA."

<p>Also called Bartholomaeus Parvus (the Little), born at Bologna, year not known; died 15 August, 1333. Nothing certain has been preserved as to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. At the end of the thirteenth century, while still young, he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, made his studies in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of his native town, and soon became noted as a capable <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and a preacher <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> cherished a great desire not only to keep the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> in connection with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>, but also to lead the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> part of this people into unity with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for this reason he supported and encouraged the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missions in the regions inhabited by <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. Bartholomew was selected to be the head and leader of a little band of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missionaries whom <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and received as his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> the city of Maragha, lying east of Lake Urumiah. Accompanied by several companions the new missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> arrived (1318-20) in the territory assigned to him. He studied the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> language, built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for his brethren of the order, and with the aid of these began his apostolic labors. He met with such success that large numbers of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> were converted and many <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> were brought into <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gave great care to this latter part of his missionary labors, as he found many <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> favorably disposed to union. Bartholomew's reputation for saintliness and learning spread rapidly into distant regions and came to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a group of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who were striving after a higher degree of perfection and the attainment of Church unity. The leader of these <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was the learned John of Kherna (Kherni), the head of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near Kherna in the district of Erentschag (now Alenja), not far from Nachidjewan. John was a pupil of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Isaias, whose <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> had produced 370 <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> <em>(Vartabed). </em>In 1328 John of Kherna sought out Bishop Bartholomew, remained with him a year and a half and became a warm advocate of union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. He sent an invitation to a conference, drawn up by the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary, to his former fellow-students, and Bartholomew went with him to Kherna, where the conference was held. The result was that a large number of learned <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> joined John of Kherna in submitting to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In order to promote union and raise <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> John founded in 1330, with the consent of Bartholomew, a religious congregation called the "Uniats (Unitores) of St Gregory the Illuminator", which was later incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. About this time Bartholomew seems to have substituted Nachidiewan for Maragha as his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. This brought him nearer to the center of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, so that he was able to work more efficiently for the development of the union. He translated a number of works into the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> language, as the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, treatises of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, the "Summa contra Gentiles" of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and a part of the <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa Theologica"</a>; he also wrote several original works, especially a work on casuistry and a treatise on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.
