<h1>Bartholomew Holzhauser</h1>  

<p>Parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer, and founder of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community; born 24 Aug., 1613, at Laugna in the <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Diocese of Augsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; died 20 May, 1658. He was one of the eleven children of Leonard and Catherine Holzhauser &mdash; poor, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and honest people. His father plied the trade of a shoemaker, and was barely able to support his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Young Holzhauser developed a great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for books and an earnest desire to enter the sacred ministry. At Augsburg he was admitted to a free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for poor boys, earning his living by singing at the doors and begging. He fell sick of an epidemic then raging, and after his recovery went home and for a time helped his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> at work. Then, with the aid of kind friends and especially of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, he continued his studies at Neuburg and Ingolstadt. His teachers were unanimous in praising his talents, his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and modesty, and entertained great hopes of his usefulness for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On 9 July, 1636, he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, then studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, in which he merited the baccalaureate on 11 May, 1639. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>, and said his first Mass on Pentecost Sunday (12 June, 1639) in the church of Our Lady of Victory at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. He exercised his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions at this place for some time, and was soon much sought after as a confessor. In the meantime he attended the lectures at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and was declared licentiate of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> on 14 June, 1640. On 1 August of the same year he came into the <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Archdiocese of Salzburg</a>, and was made dean and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Tittmoning. On 2 Feb., 1642, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chiemsee called him as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> to St. John's at Leukenthal (then Leoggenthal) in the Tyrol.

<p>In the spring of 1655, on the invitation of <a href="../cathen/13553b.htm">Archbishop Johann Philipp von Sch&ouml;nborn</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and was soon appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Bingen on the Rhine, and in 1657 dean of the district of Algesheim. Here he died at the age of only forty-five, after a life well spent in the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and for the welfare of his people and of his fellow-priests. Many wonderful things are related of him, extraordinary cures and the like. Lately a petition has been drawn up at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. On the occasion of the second centenary of his death a great celebration was held at Bingen in the presence of <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Bishop von Ketteler</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; his remains were again found, and in 1880 a new monument was erected over his grave at the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church.
<h2>His institute</h2>

<p>He founded the <a href="../cathen/02317a.htm">Bartholomites</a> (United Brethren), or, as they are officially called, the "Institutum clericorum s&aelig;cularium in communi viventium", also called Communists. Great and many were the evils caused by the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Faith had become lukewarm; <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and discipline had relaxed not only in the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> but also in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In consequence Holzhauser, even in the early days of his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> course, had been planning the formation of a congregation of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, who would lead an apostolic life in community and become models of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> perfection and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> leaders of the people. Such as excelled in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and virtue he intended to place as teachers in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> a new generation of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> willing to use all their energy for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> thus <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> he would induce to join the community. The members were expected to live in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, or in twos or threes in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and to follow out a set routine of daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and exercises. Funds were to be in common, and all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> servants were to be discarded. No <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> were to be taken, but a simple promise of obedience to the superior was to be made, confirmed by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Holzhauser tried to establish such a community in the Diocese of Eichst&auml;tt, but did not succeed, though several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were found quite willing to join him. At Tittmoning, encouraged by John Christopher von Lichtenstein, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chiemsee, suffragan and principal adviser of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, he made a good beginning. His first colleagues were George Kettner, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of noted <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> who held a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, George G&uuml;ndel, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Mailing near <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, and Michael Rottmayer, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Leinting. Priests joined from the Diocese of Chiemsee and from other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. At the death of Holzhauser the community had members at Chiemsee, <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, Freising, <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>, <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>.

<p>In 1643 Holzhauser took control of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, and placed it under the direction of Rottmayer; in 1649 it was transferred to Ingolstadt. The Seminary of <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a> and later many other <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were entrusted to the care of the community. In 1653 Dr. Rieger, one of the members, set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction for the institute and its rule. <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Pope Innocent X</a> lauded the work, but gave no formal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. This was given 7 June, 1680, by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> at the request of Emperor Leopold I. After this the community spread in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a house had been assigned them by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but it was not long occupied. The institute had many enemies and did not meet with the appreciation it deserved, so that at the end of the eighteenth century it became extinct, after having had 1595 members (according to the necrology preserved in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>). After Holzhauser, the general directors of the institute were George G&uuml;ndel, died 1666; Michael Rottmayer, died 1681; Stephen Hofer, died 1693; John Appel, died 1700; Sebastian Wittmann, died 1725; Anthony Kippel, died 1730; Matthew Kerschel, died 1742; Lambert Gastel, died 1769; John Christopher Hunold, died 1770. During the last century the wish was frequently expressed that Holzhauser's institute might be revived or similar unions formed.
<h2>Writings</h2>

<ul><li>(a) "Constitutiones et exercitia spiritualia Clericorum s&aelig;cularium in communi viventium" (Cologne, 1662; <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, 1669; Rome, 1680; <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 1782, etc.). These constitutions, used in many <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, were of value also for the spread of primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> among the people (Katholik, XXXIX, 359). In the third chapter Holzhauser advises his disciples to be solicitous in immediately and extensively establishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in which the young are taught reading, writing, and the rudiments of religion. A new edition was published by Gaduel at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1861 under the title "Venerabilis servi Dei Bartholom&aelig;i Holzhauser opuscula ecclesiastica". They contain: <ul><li>(1) "Constitutiones" . . . <li>(2) "Constitutiones pro spirituali temporalique directione instituti cler. s&aelig;c. in communi viventium, ab Innocentio XI approb. die 17 Aug. 1684". <li>(3) "Stationes quotidianorum exercitiorum spiritualium". <li>(4) "De diversis orandi modis et de modo meditandi". <li>(5) "Manipulus piarum precum". <li>(6) "Instructiones de vi&acirc; perfectionis et principiis practicis pro statu clericali et pastorali". <li>(7) "Instructiones concionatoribus catholicis valde utiles".</ul> <li>(b) "Epistola fundamentalis", written in 1644 for the consolation and encouragement of his disciples in their heavy trials, when enemies tried to destroy the community. <li>(c) "De humilitate". <li>(d) "Tractatus de discretione spiritnum". <li>(e) "Documenta pro iis qui conversioni h&aelig;reticorum et infidelium se impendunt". <li>(f) "Visiones". <br>The last-mentioned work contains the ten visions of Holzhauser, presented by him in 1646 to Emperor Ferdinand III and to Maximilian of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, together with the explanations given to Vairvaux, confessor of Maximilian. They are entitled: "De septem animalibus"; "De un&acirc; monarchi&acirc; et duabus sedibus"; "De s. Michaele archangelo et sedibus"; "De ecclesi&acirc; spons&acirc; Dei"; "De propri&acirc; person&acirc; Jesu"; "De egressione Danubii"; "De verme grandi"; "De conversione Germani&aelig;"; "Exprobratio vitiorum, exprobratio imp&oelig;nitenti&aelig;, quomodo revertatur?"; "De duabus personis". These visions, with a commentary showing their partial fulfilment, were published in German in 1849 by Ludwig Clarus. One of the prophetic visions is about <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Holzhauser foresees the execution of Charles I and the complete ruin of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in that kingdom, but also that, after the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> has ceased for 120 years, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> would be converted and do more for religion than it had done after its first conversion. This seems to have been fulfilled, for prohibition of Mass under penalty of capital punishment was enacted in 1658, and partially recalled in 1778 (Rhode Island, 1663-1683). <li>(g) "Interpretatio Apocalypsis usque ad cap. XV, v. 5."</ul>

<p>This commentary, which Holzhauser wrote at Leukenthal, exists in several <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copies; printed in 1784 at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>; in German in 1849 at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> by Clarus; in 1850 at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Holzhauser's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is: The seven stars and the seven candlesticks seen by St. John signify seven periods of the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> from its foundation to its consummation at the final judgment. To these periods correspond the seven churches of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, the seven days of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> record of creation, the seven ages before Christ, and the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost. Since, he says, all life is developed in seven stages, so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has fixed seven periods for regeneration. The first age of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <ul><li>(1) the <em>Status seminativus</em>, from Christ and the Apostles to <a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Pope Linus</a> and <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Emperor Nero</a>, is typified by the first day of creation "Spiritus Dei ferebatur super aquas", the gift of wisdom and the age from <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>. Similarly he treats; <li>(2) the <em>status irrigativus</em>, the days of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; <li>(3) <em>status illuminativus</em> from Pope Sylvester to <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a>; <li>(4) <em>status pacifitcus</em> from <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> to <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>; <li>(5) <em>status afflictionis et purgativus</em> from <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> to a strong ruler and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; <li>(6) <em>status consolationis</em> from that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the birth of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>; <li>(7) <em>status desolationis</em> from <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> to the end of the world.</ul>

<p>The central features of this commentary &mdash; the strong ruler and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, a favourite subject of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> prophecy, as well as the division of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> into seven periods; the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the Holy Roman Empire is to be the last on earth, and Chosroes, the Persian king, the predecessor of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>; the special significance of the 1260 days of <a href="../bible/rev012.htm">Apocalypse 12:6</a>, are borrowed from Joachim di Fiore (died 1202; cf. "Hist. pol. Bl&auml;tter," CXVIII, 142). Still the commentary is considered an instructive and edifying book.
