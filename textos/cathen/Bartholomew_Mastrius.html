<h1>Bartholomew Mastrius</h1>  

<p>Franciscan, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born near <a href="../cathen/06137a.htm">Forli</a>, at Meldola, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in 1602; died 3 January, 1673. He was one of the most prominent writers of his time on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a>, and took degrees at the <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a>. He also frequented the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">Universities</a> of Padua and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before assuming the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of lecturer. He acquired a profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, being deeply versed in the writings of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>. He was an open-minded and independent scholar. As a controversialist he was harsh and arrogant towards his opponents, mingling invective with his arguments. His opinions on some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> questions were fiercely combatted by many of his contemporaries and especially by Matthew Ferchi and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/12227b.htm">John Ponce</a>. When presenting the second volume of his work on the "Sentences" to <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, to whom he had dedicated it, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> asked him where he had learned to treat his opponent Ferchi in such a rough manner: Mastrius answered, "From St. Augustine and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, who in defence of their respective opinions on the interpretation of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> fought hard and not without reason": the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> smilingly remarked, "From such masters other things could be learned". <a href="../cathen/12227b.htm">Ponce</a> in his treatise on <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">Logic</a> holds that with qualifying explanations <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be included in the Categories. Mastrius in combatting this opinion characteristically says, "Hic Pontius male tractat Deum sicut et alter". Mastrius had a well-ordered <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which is seen in the clearness and precision with which he sets forth the subject-matter of discussion. His arguments for and against a proposition show real critical power and are expressed in accurate and clear language. His numerous quotations from ancient and contemporary authors and various <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of thought are a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his extensive reading. His works shed light on some of the difficult questions in <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotistic</a> philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. His "Philosophy" in five volumes folio, his "Commentaries" on the "Sentences" in four volumes, and his Moral Theology "ad mentem S. Bonaventurae" in one volume were all published in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>.
