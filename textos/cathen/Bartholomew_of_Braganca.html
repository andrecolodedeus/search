<h1>Bartholomew of Braganca</h1>  

<p>Born about 1200; died 1 July, 1271. He made his studies at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, receiving there the habit of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> from the hands of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>. According to Leander, author of the oldest life of Bartholomew, he was made <a href="../cathen/10039a.htm">master of the sacred palace</a> in 1235, during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>; but there is no mention of this event in his last testament, where he expressly states the important positions held by him. He was appointed to the See of Nemonicum, in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, 1248; what city this was is not now known. While King Louis of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was engaged upon his expedition against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Infidel</a>, Bartholomew joined the king and queen at Joppa, <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a>, and Acre, in the character of <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic legate</a>, according to some writers, his own account merely stating that he visited the king and queen at these places. King Louis desired him to make a visit to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, promising rich <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> for his church, should he comply with the request. To ensure the presence of so distinguished a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> at his own court, <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, in 1256, and during his tenure of that see he was subject to the tyranny of Ezzelino, a <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> enemy of religion. This <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, however, served to bring out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> qualities of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> which Bartholomew possessed in a high degree. It has been said that he was named <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but this is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, his testament being silent on this point also. In 1254, he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the courts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and as Henry III was, at this time, in Aquitaine, thither Bartholomew betook himself, towards the close of that year, accompanying the English king and queen to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He was, on this occasion, presented by the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">true Cross</a> and a thorn from <a href="../cathen/04540b.htm">Our Saviour's Crown</a>. These he afterwards placed in the beautiful <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Church, built by him, at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> and known as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Crown. He was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by the people and, according to the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, has always been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the title of Blessed. He wrote commentaries on Scripture, was the reputed author of a commentary on the "Hierarchy" of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">St. Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, of two volumes of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, and some smaller works.
