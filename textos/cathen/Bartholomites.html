<h1>Bartholomites</h1>  

<p>The name given to <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who sought refuge in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> after the invasion of their country by the Sultan of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in 1296. The first of their number landed at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, where a <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Bartholomew was built for them, hence their name Bartholomites. Others soon followed this first band and were established in various Italian cities, in <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/03798b.htm">Civitavecchia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. To these early foundations were afterwards added others at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, Ferrar, Bologna, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, Veterbo, etc.; in fact the Bartholomites were both numerous and prosperous. In the beginning they observed the <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">Rule of St. Basil</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Liturgy, <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> acknowledging their right thereto. But in time they abandoned their national traditions for the Roman Liturgy, adopted a habit resembling that of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and finally replaced the <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">Rule of St. Basil</a> by <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">that of St. Augustine</a>. <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a>, who approved this change (1356), also confirmed the union of their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> into one congregation governed by a superior-general and a general chapter. The superiors-general were at first elected for life, but in 1474 <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Pope Sixtus IV</a> caused them to be voted for every three years.

<p><a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> granted the congregation the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a> and <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> ratified the same; nevertheless the Bartholomites were prohibited from joining any other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order except that of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>. Durazzo, their first <a href="../cathen/03341a.htm">cardinal protector</a>, was appointed by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1640, but they did not long enjoy this signal advantage. Their regular observance began to decline, their ranks were but meagrely recruited and most of their houses had to be closed till at length only four or five were left, in which about forty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> lived as best they could. There seemed to be no way of averting this decadence. <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> authorized the Bartholomites to enter other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders or else to secularize themselves, assuring each of them a pension. He suppressed their congregation and its houses and revenues were put to new uses. Among the most noted Bartholomites were: Father Martin, who conducted the first <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and was their superior; Father Anthony of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, who was the first superior-general of their congregation; Esteban Palma, who four times held the office of general and laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the reform of the congregation; Cherubini Cerbelloni of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and Paul Costa of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, who were celebrated preachers and Scoti, Pori, Girolamo Cavalieri, J. B. Ladriani, and Gregorio Bitio who left literary works which were, however, soon forgotten. In their church at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> is still preserved the celebrated portrait of Christ known as the Holy Face of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>.
