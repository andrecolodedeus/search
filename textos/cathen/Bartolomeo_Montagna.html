<h1>Bartolomeo Montagna</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, chief representative of the <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> School, b. at Orzinuovi about 1450; d. at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, 11 October, 1523.

<p>Very little is known concerning his life. His work presents not a very original, but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> combination of the dual influence of <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. The forms, draperies, grandeur, and often the energy of expression betray the action of Montagna, but the order of his altar-pieces, their harmonious symmetry, and the beauty of their colouring recall Giovanni Bellini or <a href="../cathen/03373c.htm">Carpaccio</a>. Perhaps, he even surpassed these two masters as regards power of tone, and resembles <a href="../cathen/04509a.htm">Crivelli</a> more closely. Two Madonnas in the gallery of <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> and a smaller one in the Lochis Gallery at <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a> (1487) are characteristic of his early manner, which is not free from stiffness and a certain dryness. Here the artist still retains the old process of distemper. His best period was from 1490 to 1505, his years of work and travel, during which he was busily occupied throughout all the district. At <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> house <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ades</a> in fresco, and executed the graceful <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, unhappily much damaged, of the Chapel of St. Blaise in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sts. Nazzaro and Celso (1493), of which Salconetto was the architect. There is little <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> in the construction, but the details, despite the dilapidation of the whole, still present a charming effect. In the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> there are two circles of panels with figures of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> under figures of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> between pilasters, and a frieze with a procession of Nereids. The whole, supported by the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> on pendentives, is a brilliant example of the delightful inconsistency of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. There are frescoes by Montagna in the Scuola del Santo at Padua. His best-known works are his altar-pieces, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in oil in the manner of Bellini.

<p>The large retable of the Brera (1499), the Madonna <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in a magnificent <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> with two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> on each side and three <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> playing on the steps of the throne, is perhaps his masterpiece. Whether for its architecture, its dignity, the sweetness of its figures, or for the depth and power of its colouring, it is in all respects one of the most beautiful canvases produced at that period in Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The "Piet&agrave;" of Monte Berico (1500) is of a quite different character: it is a startling picture of grief, the figures being of a violent, almost brutal naturalness. The Academy of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> possesses some works in his later manner; the tone grows subdued, becoming brown and slightly hard and dull. Such is the "Madonna <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> between <a href="../cathen/13100c.htm">St. Roch</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>". But there is still a deep sentiment of mystical adoration in the "Christ between <a href="../cathen/13100c.htm">St. Roch</a> and St. Sebastian". <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> is especially rich in Montagna's works, no less than ten being found at the Academy, not to mention the frescoes of the Duomo of S. Lorenzo and some altar-pieces, such as that of Santa Corona. Nearly all are late works. Outside of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> may be mentioned the "Ecce Homo" of the Louvre and especially the charming piece, as tender and delicate as a <a href="../cathen/03373c.htm">Carpaccio</a>, the "Three Angelic Musicians"; a large and magnificent retable of 1500 at the Museum of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>; a beautiful bust of the Madonna at <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>; a "Holy Family" at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and some other less important works in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (Butler, Farrer, and Samuelson collections, and at the home of Lord Cowper at Panshanger).

<p>Bartolomeo had a son, Benedetto, who was chiefly notable as an engraver. As a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> he is little more than a feeble imitator of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by a Madonna at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and a "Trinity" in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>. He flourished from 1490 to 1541.
