<h1>Bartolomeo Platina</h1>  

<p>Originally named S<font size=-2>ACCHI,</font> b. at Piadena, near <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, in 1421; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1481. He first enlisted as a soldier, and was then appointed tutor to the sons of the Marquis Ludovico Gonzaga. In 1457 he went to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and studied under the Greek scholar Argyropulos. In 1402 he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, probably in the suite of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga. After <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> had reorganized the College of Abbreviators (1463), and increased the number to seventy, Platina in May, 1464, was elected a member. When <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> abolished the ordinances of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius</a>, Platina with the other new members was deprived of his office. Angered thereat, he wrote a pamphlet insolently demanding from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the recall of his restrictions. When called upon to justify himself he answered with insolence and was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Castle of Sant&rsquo; Angelo, being released after four months on condition that he remain at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In February, 1468, with about twenty other Humanists, he was again <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> on suspicion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and of conspiring against the life of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but the latter charge was dropped for lack of evidence, while they were acquitted on the former. But not even Platina denies that the members of the Roman Academy, imbued with half-pagan and materialistic doctrines, were found guilty of immorality. The story about his constancy under trial and torture is unfounded.

<p>After his release, 7 July, 1469, he expected to be again in the employ of <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>, who, however, declined his services. Platina threatened vengeance and executed his threat, when at the suggestion of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> he wrote his "Vit&aelig; Pontificum Platin&aelig; historici liber de vita Christi ac omnium pontificum qui hactenus ducenti fuere et XX" (Venice, 1479). In it he paints his enemy as cruel, and an archenemy of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. For centuries it influenced historical opinions until critical research <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> otherwise. In other places party spirit is evident, especially when he treats of the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Notwithstanding, his "Lives of the Popes" is a work of no small merit, for it is the first systematic handbook of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a>. Platina felt the need of critical research, but shirked the examination of details. By the end of 1474 or the beginning of 1475 Platina offered his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> to <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>; it is still preserved in the Vatican Library. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> acceptance may cause surprise, but it is probable he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of its contents except in so far as it concerned his own pontificate up to November, 1474. After the death of Giandrea Bussi, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aleria, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed Platina librarian with a yearly salary of 120 ducats and an official residence in the Vatican. He also instructed him to make a collection of the chief privileges of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. This collection, whose value is acknowledged by all the <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a>, is still preserved in the Vatican archives. In the preface Platina not only avoids any antagonism towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> but even refers with <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> to the punishing of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, which is the best <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, by his marks of favour, had won Platina for the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Besides his principal work Platina wrote several others of smaller importance, notably: "Historia inclita urbis Mantu&aelig; et serenissim&aelig; famili&aelig; Gonzag&aelig;". The new Pinacotheca Vaticana contains the magnificent fresco by <a href="../cathen/10169c.htm">Melozzo da Forli</a>. It represents <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> surrounded by his Court and appointing Platina prefect of the Vatican.

<p>As a paragraph from Platina's "Vit&aelig; Pontificum" first gave rise to the legend of the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of Halley's comet by <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a>, we here give the legend briefly, after recalling some historical facts. After the fall of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> (1453), Nicolas V appealed in vain to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes for a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> (1455-58), immediately after his succession, sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the various Courts for the same purpose; and, meeting with no response, <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> 29 June, 1456, prescribing the following: (1) all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were to say during Mass the "oratio contra paganos"; (2) daily, between noon and vespers, at the ringing of a bell, everybody had to say three <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Fathers</a> and Hail Marys; (3) processions were to be held by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the faithful on the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of each month, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were to preach on Faith, patience, and penance; to expose the cruelty of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and urge all to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for their deliverance. The first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of July (4 July), the first processions were held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On the same day the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> began to besiege Belgrade. On 14 July the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> gained a small advantage, and on the twenty-first and twenty-second the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were put to flight.

<p>In the same year Halley's comet appeared. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> it was first seen in June. Towards the end of the month it was still visible for three hours after sunset, causing great excitement everywhere by its extraordinary splendour. It naturally attracted the attention of <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologers</a> as may appear from the long "judicium astrologicum" by Avogario, of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 17 June, 1467; it was found again by Celoria among the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of <a href="../cathen/14786a.htm">Paolo Toscanelli</a>, who had copied it himself. The comet was seen till 8 July. It is evident, from all the documents of that time, that it had disappeared from sight several days before the battle of <a href="../cathen/02407a.htm">Belgrade</a>. These two simultaneous facts&mdash;the publication of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> and the appearance of the comet&mdash;were connected by Platina in the following manner: "Apparente deinde per aliquot dies cometa crinito et rubeo: cum mathematici ingentem pestem: charitatem annon&aelig;: magnam aliquam cladem futuram dicerent: ad avertendam iram Dei Calistus aliquot dierum supplicationes decrevit: ut si quid hominibus immineret, totum id in Thurcos christiani nominis hostes converteret. Mandavit kpr&aelig;tera ut assiduo rogatu Deus flecteretur in meridie campanis signum dari fidelibus omnibus: ut orationibus eos juvarent: qui cxontra Thurcos continuo dimicabant" (A maned and fiery comet appearing for several days, while scientists were predicting a great plague, dearness of food, or some great disaster, Callistus decreed that supplicatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> be held for some days to avert the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that, if any calamity threatened <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, it might be entirely diverted against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the foes of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name. He likewise ordered that the bells be rung at midday as a signal to all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to move <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with assiduous petitions and to assist with their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> those engaged in constant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>).

<p>Platina has, generally speaking, recorded the facts truly; but is wrong at one point, viz., where he says that the <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologers'</a> predictions of great calamities induced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to prescribe public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> does not contain a word on the comet, as the present writer can testify from personal examination of the authenticated document.

<p>A careful investigation of the authenticated "Regesta" of <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> (about one hundred folios), in the Vatican archives, shows that the comet is not mentioned in any other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> document. Nor do other writers of the time refer to any such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> against the comet, though many speak both of the comet and of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The silence of <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> (1446-59), is particularly significant. In his "Chronicorum libri tres" he enumerates accurately all the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> prescribed by Callistus; he also mentions the comet of 1456 in a chapter entitled, "De cometis, unde causentur et quid significent"&mdash;but never refers to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and processions against the comet, although all <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decrees were sent to him. Aeneas Sylvius and St. John Capistrano, who preached the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, considered the comet rather as a favourable omen in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>.

<p>Hence it is clear that Platina has looked wrongly upon the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> as the outcome of fear of comets. The historians of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries contented themselves with quoting Platina more or less accurately (Calvisius 1605, <a href="../cathen/14235a.htm">Spondanus</a> 1641, Lubienietski 1666). Fabre (1726) in his continuation of the "Histoire Eccl&eacute;siastique" by Fleury gave a somewhat free paraphrase. Bruys (1733), an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> (who afterwards entered the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> again), copies Fleury-Fabre adding "que le Pape profita en habile homme de la <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> et de la cr&eacute;dulit&eacute; des peuples". It is only when we come to Laplace's "Exposition du Syst&#232;me du monde", that we find the expression that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered the comet and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcized</a> (<em>conjur&eacute;</em>), which expression we find again in Daru's poem "L'Astronomie". Arago (Des Com&#232;tes en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral etc. Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes 1832, 244) converts it into an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Arago's treatise was soon translated into all the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages after which time the appearance of the comet (1456) is hardly ever mentioned, but this historical lie must be repeated in various shapes. Smyth (Cycle of celestial objects) speaks of a special protest and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcizing</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and the comet. Grant (History of physical <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>) refers to the publication of a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, in which Callistus <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> both the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and the Comet. <a href="../cathen/02178b.htm">Babinet</a> (Revue des deux mondes, 23 ann., vol. 4, 1853, 831) has the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> "lancer un timide anath&#232;me sur la com&#232;te et sur les ennemis de la Chr&eacute;tient&eacute;", whilst in the battle of <a href="../cathen/02407a.htm">Belgrade</a> "les Fr&#232;res Mineurs aux premiers rangs, invoquaient l'exorcisme du pape contre la com&#232;te". In different ways the legend is repeated by Chambers, Flammarion, Draper, Jamin, Dickson White, and others. However, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is gaining ground and it is hoped the story of the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> comet will soon be relegated to the realm of fables.
