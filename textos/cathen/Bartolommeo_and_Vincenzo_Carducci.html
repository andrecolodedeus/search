<h1>Bartolommeo and Vincenzo Carducci</h1>  

<p>Both known in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> as <em>Carducho</em>

<p>Florentine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, brothers, usually grouped under the Spanish School. Of these two artists Bartolommeo, the elder (b. 1560; d. 1608), after executing a few <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, only two of which are worthy of note &#151; those representing the Immaculate Conception and the Nativity in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Church &#151; accompanied Zuccaro to the court of Philip II and assisted him in his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>. Here Bartolommeo worked in conjunction with Tibaldi upon the decoration of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, the latter doing the ceiling and the former the walls. He took with him, in 1585, his younger brother, who was then at so tender an age that he declares he "had very faint recollections of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and spoke <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> as his mother tongue". The elder brother worked also as an architect and as a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, and executed a considerable amount of fresco work in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> for Philip II, notably the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in the Cloister, and commenced to decorate a gallery in the palace of the Pardo, for Philip III, with scenes taken from the life of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. He died, however, before he had made much progress in this work. His most important production is his "Descent from the Cross", in the church of San Felipe in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. Vincenzo was appointed court <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> by Philip III, in 1609, and completed the work commenced by his brother, adopting the history of Achilles as his subject. He was also court <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> to Philip IV. He did not live to finish his last picture, a <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, which is inscribed "Vincencius Carducho hic vitam non opus finit 1638", and his death occurred while under confinement, as he lost his reason early in 1638. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> at Paular fifty-four large pictures representing the life of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>; the National Museum of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, too, and the churches and palaces of that city abound in his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. He was also the author of an excellent book on <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, "Dialogos de las excelencias de la Pintura", and was responsible for obtaining in 1633 the remission of a tax on <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> which was a serious burden upon the artists of his day. Four years later he secured the total abolition of the tax. He was also commissioned to decorate the Palace of Buen Retiro, and executed a series of historical frescoes which were practically the first secular pictures seen in Castile.
