<h1>Bartolom&eacute; Esteban Murillo</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, 31 December, 1617; d. there 5 April, 1682. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> surname was Esteban; that of Murillo, which he assumed in accordance with an Andalusian custom, was his mother's. His father was an artisan. An <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> at the age of ten, Bartolom&eacute; was brought up by his uncle, J.A. Lagar&egrave;s, a barber. He became the pupil, probably while still very young, of Juan del Castillo, a mediocre <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, but good teacher, whose atelier was at that time much frequented. It is said that, to gain a living, the young man in those days made <em>sargas</em> &#151; cheap <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> on rough canvas sold at country <em><a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferias</a></em> (fairs), and shipped to America by traders. The Museum of <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz</a> claims, but without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, that one of these Murillo <em>sargas</em> is in its possession. In 1640 Castillo went to live at <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz</a>. In the meantime, Moya, having just arrived from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he had been <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Dyck's</a> pupil, showed Murillo, who was an old friend of his, the cartoons, drawings, copies, and engravings he had brought with him. Murillo set out on a journey to study the great masters, but went no farther than <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velasquez</a>, the king's <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and the friend of Olivares, was himself a native of Seville; he welcomed his young compatriot and gave him the <em>entr&eacute;e</em> to all the royal galleries, where Murillo saw the masterpieces of <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Veronese</a>, Tintoretto, and <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, not to mention <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velasquez</a> himself. He spent three years here, and this was all his travel. He returned to Seville in 1644. After this he left Seville but once, in 1681, when he went to Cadiz to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> an altar for the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> which he never had the time to finish. A fall from his scaffolding or else a serious illness &#151; accounts differ &#151; forced him to let himself be taken back, hurriedly, to <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, where he died after a brief period of suffering.

<p>His was a very pure life, and perfectly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, all spent within that one Sevillian horizon which the artist never wished to change for any other. His <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in the <em>porter&iacute;a</em> of the Minims made a celebrity of him at the age of twenty-eight (1646). From that time he devoted himself to work on a large scale for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of his native Seville, work which, in some respects, recalls the Giottesque <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the fourteenth century. In contrast with <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velasquez</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Murillo is wholly a religious <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. With the exception of a few portraits and some genre pieces, not one profane picture of his is known to exist. The product of his life's work is summed up in the great cycles of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> la Blanca (1665), of the Caridad Hospital (1670-74), of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> (1676), of the Venerables Sacerdotes (1678), of the Augustinians (1680), and, lastly, of the Cadiz <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, together with a large number of pictures made at different times for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Seville or other churches and many devotional works for private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Murillo was the national <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of a country where all sentiment was still merged in the one sentiment of religion. The critics have distinguished three periods, or manners, in his work: the cold, the hot, and the "vaporous". The classification is foolish and pedantic. It is enough to look at his "Angels' Kitchen" (1646), his "Birth of the Virgin" (1655), and his "Holy Family" (1670), all in the Louvre: here we can see nothing but the natural evolution of a talent which from first to last pursued but one ideal &#151; the poetical transfiguration of facts and <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p>This ideal is already fully perceptible in the first of the examples cited, or in the "Death of St. Clare" (Dresden Museum), which also belongs to the <em>porter&iacute;a</em> series. In the "Angels' Kitchen", as in many others of his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, the artist's problem is to combine the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> with the real and familiar. Here we have a holy <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, lifted from the ground, while <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with shining wings attend to the service of the refectory and wash the pans; and lastly, some spectators are peeping through a half-open door. The whole scene is displayed with admirable clearness, without a suggestion of hiatus between the three parts which are so diverse in character.

<p>From this period date those few genre <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> which may be regarded as exceptional works of Murillo, the most famous example being the "Pouilleux" of the Louvre. Like every great <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, Murillo is a realist, and goes as far as anyone in the pathetic <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of suffering. But he refuses to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> these horrors with the frightful dilettantism, the cold, cruel detachment, of other Spanish artists. For him, pain and misery are objects of pity, not of curiosity or pleasure. Alone of the great <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of his race, his genius is tender, affectionate. Murillo's realism, however exact and sound, is never altogether impersonal or objective. In spite of himself, he communicates, together with the record of the reality, the emotions which it produces in himself; he does not alter its form, but he adds to it something of his own. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the classic land of brutal observation, of the "slice taken from life" served up raw and bleeding, Murillo invents, combines, achieves compositions. He has an <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and he does not make a point of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of ignoring it. With more than average gifts for portraiture &#151; as witness his portrait of Padre Cabanillas, at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, or the admirable figure in the Museum of the Hispanic Society in New York &#151; he made very few portraits. On the other hand, he has the gift and the <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> for story-telling. The Italian sense of fine arrangement, of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> symmetry and harmonious balance of grouping, as in his Holy Families, in the Louvre, is a quality which he alone seems to have possessed in his age.

<p>Murillo was a great <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of sentiment. Like Rembrandt, he understood that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> language of the Gospel was the language of the people. Like him, he especially delighted in the merciful and tender aspects of the Gospel. Nothing can be more touching than the "Prodigal Son" of the Hermitage &#151; not even Rembrandt's treatment of that subject &#151; or his sketches on the same <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> in the Prado. Like Rembrandt, he loves to bring the sacred <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> near to us, to make us see them as intimate and familiar realities, to show us the Divine all about us in our lives. Murillo, no doubt, has the defects of these qualities. He never suffered enough. His optimism, his bonhomie, his grace, lack the seriousness that trials should have imparted. His serene smile lacks that intangible quality of having been through sorrow. Failing this experience, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> tends somewhat to levity and to preciosity.

<p>His pre-eminence as, superlatively, the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of the Immaculate Conception seems to have been foreshadowed in the circumstances of his birth. At Seville, in 1617, the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; and this splendid celebration took place in Murillo's native city only a few months before his birth. The pictorial treatment of the subject had long been determined, in its main outlines, by a vision said to have been vouchsafed to a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> of the sixteenth century, and a hundred examples of it are found among earlier <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>. The mere <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception &#151; exemption from the original taint &#151; necessarily eluded all material representation: the equivalent chosen was the theme of the Assumption. The body is seen exempt from all the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of gravitation. Murillo has treated this theme more than twenty times, without repeating himself or ever wearying: six versions at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, six others at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, the famous Louvre picture (dated 1678), and still others scattered over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> &#151; all these did not exhaust the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter's</a> enthusiasm or his power of expressing apotheosis.

<p>It is a remarkable fact that these pictures, which represent the most transcendently spiritual action, are the most thoroughly feminine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. But for religious representations of the Blessed Virgin and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, indeed, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is almost absent from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. The most famous portraits of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the <em>infantas</em> or <em>meninas</em> of <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velasquez</a>, retain nothing of feminine charm: they are <em>simulacra</em> and phantoms without verisimilitude. Side by side with these apparitions, Murillo's Virgins produce a comforting effect of relief. Here are <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and vital, with the most thoroughly external charms of their sex. In them the impulse of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> rises to <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, and without Murillo <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> would be deprived of its most beautiful <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> poems. Many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, see in this style of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> the symptoms of decadence in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> religious sentiment. This question of the soundness or unsoundness of his devotional tendencies cannot be treated here, but it may at least be claimed for Murillo that his art &#151; notably in these Immaculate Conceptions &#151; is no less genuinely religious than the dry productions of, say, a Philippe de Champaigne.
