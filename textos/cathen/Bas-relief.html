<h1>Bas-relief</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> executed upon and attached to a flat surface. The usual impression produced by an artistic relief is that about one-half of the actual proportions of the object are being seen in their third dimension of depth. Strictly speaking, however, relief <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> is subdivided into various kinds. In <em>alto-rilievo</em> (Italian for "high relief") the figures are sculptured partly or wholly in the round, that is, they project entirely, or almost entirely, from the surface of the block in which they are cut. The metopes from the Parthenon (Elgin Marbles) now in the British Museum are among the best examples of alto-rilievo. Mezzo-rilievo (Italian for semi-relief; French, <em>demi-relief</em>) presents figures that are rounded to half their natural proportions, but without detached parts. Basso-rilievo (Italian for low-relief; French, <em>bas-relief</em>) is a form of surface-ornamentation in which the projection is very slight. The finest known specimen of low relief is the frieze around the <em>cella </em>of the Parthenon; large portions of it are to be seen in the British Museum. The lowest kind of relief is that described by the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> term <em>rilievo-st&iacute;acciato </em>(depressed or flattened relief). This scarcely rises from the surface upon which it is carved, and is mostly an art of fine lines and delicate indications. <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello's</a> Florentine Madonnas and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are among the best examples. Finally cavo-rilievo (Italian for hollow relief; French, <em>relief-en-creux</em>) is a method of concave <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> in which the highest part or outline is on a level with the surface, while the roundness is considerably below it. Cavo-rilievo was practiced chiefly by the Egyptians whose hollow reliefs are known by the Greek term <em>Koilanaglyphs.</em>

<p>Relief is the form of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> that comes nearest to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, both having composition, perspective, and the play of light and shadow. Relief would seem to have much in common with drawing, though in reality less importance attaches to line than to the modeling of contour and to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and effective rendering of chiaroscuro. The human form is undoubtedly the proper object of relief, which appears to be particularly suited to the representation of numerous figures in action.. In the Greek and Roman classic reliefs these figures are usually in processional order, engaged in historic or military events, or in the ceremonial of worship. Relief is well suited, also, to the portrayal of series of scenes, as in the bronze doors of various <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptisteries</a> illustrating the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Figures and objects in relief are generally worked out in the same material as the background, though there are exceptions to this rule in Greek art, and in the decorative work of the Chinese and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>. In the larger reliefs marble, bronze, and terra-cotta are used exclusively; while in smaller works the precious metals and stones, <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, stucco, enamel, wood, etc., predominate. The reliefs of the Egyptians and <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, not highly plastic, were made more effective by the introduction of strong colors. The early Greeks also made use of polychromy, as instanced in the metope relief in the Museum of Palermo. In Gothic art and in the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> it was the custom to tint wood, terra-cotta, and stucco, but not marble or stone. Relief is one of the earliest forms of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> practiced, and probably originated with the stone-cutters of prehistoric days, though clay and wood are supposed to have been the earliest materials employed, owing to greater facility in molding and carving them.

<p>There is reason to believe that relief <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> existed before the introduction of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> in the round, or when only rude figures of the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> had been attempted. The Babylonians, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">Hittites</a> practiced it contemporaneously with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> in the round. The Egyptians, though they employed a kind of low relief, especially on the interiors of buildings, made a still greater use of Koilanaglyphs. The Greeks, conceiving relief <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> in its purely plastic sense, achieved the greatest mastery of the art. With them it was used both as an ornament and as an integral part of the plan when allied with architecture. Distinguishing strictly between high and low relief, they used the former between the triglyphs, and the tympana of the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, and the latter in friezes, tombstones, etc. Certain fixed principles governed the Greek relief: the spaces were adequately filled the backgrounds never carved, and it was a rule that all heads should be at the same height from the base, whether the figures sat, rode, or stood (<em>Isokepholeia</em>). In the Hellenistic period a more picturesque and dramatic form of composition prevailed, and the backgrounds were carved in pictorial style. With the Etruscans relief was applied mainly in the artistic handicrafts. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> it frequently degenerated into a pictorial mode in which several planes were employed, but examples are still extant that are highly classic, e.g. the groups of the Arch of Titus, the continuous winding reliefs of the Column of Trajan, imperial sarcophagi (in the Vatican), and reliefs of the Capitol Museum, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Romans no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> owed their finest reliefs to the Greek artists they harbored and employed upon themes taken from the history of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era inaugurated what might be mistaken for a new art, but the change was in subject more than in mode, for all the early examples show a great similarity to antique models in form, pose, and drapery. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> relief appears mainly in the sarcophagi with their Biblical, Apostolic, or symbolic subjects: Daniel in the lions' den, Moses striking water from the rock, the adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, the raising of Lazarus, the Good Shepherd. <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Heathen</a> myths are also used, invested with a new significance: Orpheus is Christ, drawing the creatures of the wild by the sweet strains of his music, Ulysses attached to the mast is believed to typify the Crucifixion (O. Marucchi). Occasionally a carving on a <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> tombstone shows real merit, and the lamps adorned with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> symbols are frequently artistic. As they depart from the classic tradition, however, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> reliefs grow ruder and more imperfect. Those of the latter part of the second and the third century have little merit. The fourth century, in spite of the decline, bequeathes some specimens, now in the Lateran Museum; the sarcophagus of Junius Bassus in the vaults of St. Peter's is highly esteemed as a work of art. When the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> basilica replaced the cubiculum the influence of imperial Constantinople had substituted <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> for both <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. The few reliefs of that period that have survived bear a strongly Byzantine character, which is also apparent in all early <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> workmanship, reliefs, <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, etc. The reliefs of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, from the time of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, show the same influence in combination with the Teutonic spirit, as in the sixth-century <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of San Vitale. In figure-carving, however, there is a distinct tending from symbolism to realism. The rude Lombardic bas-reliefs of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> frequently border on the grotesque, but the authors went to nature for their hunting scenes and forms of animals. The bronze reliefs of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Michael, <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, are one of the legacies of the eleventh century; those of the Golden Gate, <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, are considered the finest work of the late Romanesque period.

<p>With the merging of the Romanesque into the Gothic, relief <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> assumes a new character and a peculiar importance in its close association with architecture, and in the many uses it is put to in tympana, spandrels, etc. As a purely <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian</a> and beautiful form of art it ranks high; numerous examples are extant, especially in the northern countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> it had small hold, for as early as 1300 <a href="../cathen/01470a.htm">Andrea Pisano</a>, who is called a Gothic, was inaugurating a renaissance. Picturesque relief reached its fullest development in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> doors of <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a> and the marble <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of Santa Croce by <a href="../cathen/09556a.htm">Benedetto da Majano</a>. <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a> in his admirable high and low reliefs and the <a href="../cathen/13095a.htm">Della Robbias</a> in their enamels return to a more plastic conception. During the entire baroque period (<a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> being the last <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> of the late <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>) works of a low order of inspiration prevailed. The <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Thorwaldsen, influenced by the study of Attic models, produced reliefs of great beauty and plasticism. The works of <a href="../cathen/03298b.htm">Canova</a> were likewise classics, though frequently cold and feeble. Rauch in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and Rude in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> modeled spirited reliefs. In our day at the head of the admirable French <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> stands Rodin, an impressionist and <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychologist</a>, producing unfinished reliefs which nevertheless are almost Greek in their imprint of life. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, fine reliefs, especially decorative works, are being modeled. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the younger men are forming new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of plastic work. In America, though good work in relief is done, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> in the round prevails. Everywhere the tendency is to neglect the distinction between the different kinds of relief, to be independent in method and treatment, and principles sway as of old between the pictorial the pictorial and the plastic.
