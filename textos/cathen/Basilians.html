<h1>Basilians</h1>  

<p>(Priests of the Community of St. Basil)

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, Mgr. D'Aviau, the last <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne, saw his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> diminish so rapidly through <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, that only about one-third of them remained, with no recruits to replace them. It was impossible to maintain a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> or a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, so in 1800 he founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the almost inaccessible little village of St. Symphorien de Mahun, in the mountains of the Vivarais. This institution was placed in the charge of Father Lapierre, who had managed to take care of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Symphorien during this period of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. His assistant was Father Marie Joseph Actorie, who had been professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Die before the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. In spite of its <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> beginning and the many dangers to which it was exposed, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> prospered. In 1802, the state of the country had improved to such an extent that concealment was no longer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and Father Picansel, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Annonay, and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, succeeded in obtaining from the municipal authorities of that town the lease of a former <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was transferred. For many years the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> performed the work which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had expected from it, but the long fight against poverty and the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of so-called liberals threatened at last to be too much for those in charge. Some other method had to be tried, and in 1822, the professors asked to be permitted to found a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community, with the college at Annonay for its mother-house. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15493a.htm">Viviers</a>, in whose diocese the town of Annonay was included, granted the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> permission, and appointed a commission to draw up a rule for the new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. On 21 November, 1822, the ten members who were at the time the teaching staff of the college, made the promise which bound them temporarily to the work. They were, Fathers Lapierre, Duret, Vallon, Polly, Tourvieille, Tracol, Martineche, Fayolle, Payan, and Pages.

<p>In 1837 a constitution was drawn up and sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for approval. By this the members of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> were to be bound by the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, obedience, chastity, and stability. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty, however, was limited. Each member of the community could retain all his own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and his Mass intentions, and was to receive a small salary from the community. By this <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> he could not accumulate and increase his possessions, but had to spend all his salary and the annual income from his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and this included the prohibition of speculation or any other worldly moneymaking. This community was to be under the direction of a superior general, residing at Annonay, the <a href="../cathen/15493a.htm">Diocese of Viviers</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The aim of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was to be the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> youth, especially of such as intended to become <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. This constitution was signed by several <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, all of whom had been able to appreciate the work done by the community, and to testify to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of its members. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was pleased to declare the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> worthy of praise, and in 1863 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> confirmed this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, granting at the same time certain privileges and imposing certain restrictions on the possessions of the community. A few years ago, the constitutions were again sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> wished to make some changes in the administration of the community, and these are now being tested with a view to their final approval. When the recent <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> banishing <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was put in force, the Basilians had colleges in Annonay, <a href="../cathen/11668a.htm">P&eacute;rigueux</a>, Aubenas, Privas, and Vernoux, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; Blidah and Bone in Algiers; and Plymouth in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. All these, with the exception of he last, were transferred to seculars or confiscated, and the religious <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to scatter until more favourable times.

<p>In 1852, Mgr. De Charbonnel, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, requested the Basilians to found a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Accordingly, a small number were sent there, and opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which has developed into the present St. Michael's College, the headquarters of the Basilians in America. It was opened in a small house, but was soon moved to a wing of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace which had been built for the purpose. In September, 1855, the cornerstone of the present building was laid. Since then various additions have been made, and the college is now able to accommodate a large number of students. The first superior was Father Soulerin, who managed the college from 1852 to 1865, when he was elected superior general of his community. St. Michael's is federated with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, its president is ex officio a member of the Senate of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> council, and it also appoints two other representatives to the senate. There are three courses of study open to its students, the commercial, the classical, and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>. Among the more prominent of those who made their studies, either partially or entirely, at St. Michael's were the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a> and the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Hamilton</a>, <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>, London, and Sault Ste. Marie in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and Albany and <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>The American Province includes four other colleges and numerous <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The colleges are Assumption college, Sandwich, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; St. Basil's College, Waco; St. Thomas's College, Houston, and St. Mary's Seminary, La Porte, in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. Of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in charge of the Basilians, the most important are St. Basil's and the Holy Rosary, <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, Sandwich, Amherstburg, and Owen Sound in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and St. Anne's, Detroit. The noviciate of the community and the scholasticate are in <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> lasts for one year, after which the members remain under temporal <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> for three years. As no one can enter the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> who does not intend to become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the final <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are not taken until the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a>, so that, if, at the end of three years the scholastic is not ready for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, he renews his temporal <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. St. Basil's College, Waco, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, was founded in 1889. The course of studies includes both the commercial and classical departments. St. Thomas's College, Houston, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, was founded in 1900. It is a day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. St. Mary's Seminary, La Porte, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, was opened in October, 1901, by the Rt. Rev. N.A. Gallagher, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>. Its primary object is the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young men for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but there is also maintained in connection with the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in which boys and young men are prepared for any of the learned professions. It is under the direct supervision of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>.
