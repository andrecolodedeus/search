<h1>Basilides</h1>  

<p>Martyrs bearing the name of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> are mentioned in the old <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> on three different days, namely, on 10, 12, and 28 June. Under the last <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> is placed the long list of Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who suffered during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a>, and among these occurs the name of a <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> gives an entire chapter of his <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> (<a href="../fathers/250106.htm">VI.5</a>) to <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and Potamiana. After Potamiana had been sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, an officer of the court, led her to execution. He showed himself compassionate to Potamiana and kept back the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> rabble who would have mocked her. Potamiana thanked him and exhorted him to be consoled, for after her death she would entreat the Lord concerning him and would reward his kindness. Shortly after this <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> was called on to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. He replied that he could not swear, and openly acknowledged himself to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. When taken before the judge he made an unwavering confession and was thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. He was visited by several <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to whom he related that, three days after her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, Potamiana had appeared to him and had set a crown on his head with the assurance that the Lord would soon take <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> to Himself. <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> was then <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and the next day he was beheaded. In the present Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> his name appears on 30 June. In the so-called <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and in the present list of Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> the name of a <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> appears on 10 and 12 June. On each occasion the name is accompanied by a statement of the locality of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the Via Aurelia. The names of the companions in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> vary on the two different days. The list for 12 June is very involved; apparently the same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> is referred to on both days and for some reason his name is repeated on 12 June. The Acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of a Roman <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> are still in existence; they have, however, no historical existence and belong to a date considerably later.
