<h1>Basilissa</h1>  

<p>Various <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, attributed to different localities yet bearing the common name of Basilissa, are referred to in all the catalogues of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> both of early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; their names also appear in the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> and <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the Greek and Roman Churches. Nothing is known positively as to any one of these sufferers for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>; the Acts of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, so far as such exist, are purely legendary and originated at a later date. The fact, however, that the name occurs several times in the so-called <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and in old Greek catalogues is certain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that that a number of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> named Basilissa were actually <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the ancient Church. At the same time, it is not impossible that the same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> is recorded on different days. Among these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> should be mentioned: Julian and Basilissa of Antioch; in the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (ed. Rossi-Duchesne, 6) they are given as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> under 6 January. A later legend makes Basilissa the virgin wife of Julian and narrates that she died a natural death together with other virgins, while Julian suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in company with many other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> during the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The same <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> makes mention, under 12 March, of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Basilissa, wife of Felicio, and states the locality "in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>". On the next day 13 March, occurs the name of another <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> called Basilissa, wife of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Eustacius of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>. Later legends, which were accepted by the Greek <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">menologies</a> and synaxaria, speak of a virgin and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Basilissa of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, whose feast was celebrated on 3 September; this Basilissa is probably identical with the one just mentioned. On 22 March the names of two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Basilissa and Calinice, are given with the statement "in Galatia". Under 16 April the old catalogues contain the names of a number of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, among whom appears a Basilissa; according to later accounts these sufferers for the Faith were all thrown in to the sea. Under the previous day, 15 April, two Roman matrons, Basilissa and Anastasia, are recorded; they apparently died in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. Another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whose name is sometimes written Basilla and sometimes Basilissa, was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> on 20 May. She was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a>, it is stated, on the Via Salaria. The celebrated Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Basilla, who died in 304 and whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is entered from the year 354 under 22 September is the oldest known Roman catalogue of feasts (Depositio martyrum), was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/07276b.htm">Hermes</a> on the Via Salaria Vetus. It is, therefore, a question whether the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> given under 20 May and this latter Basilla are not one and the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; but the identity of the two cannot be positively affirmed. The present <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> includes several of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; 9 January, Basilissa of Antioch; 22 March, Basilissa and Callinice; 15 April, Basilissa and Anastasia; 3 September, Basilissa of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>.
