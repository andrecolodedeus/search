<h1>Basle-Lugano</h1>  

<p>Basle-Lugano is the largest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. It is composed of the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Dioceses</a> of Basle and Lugano which are united only by having a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in common.
<h2 id="section1">The Diocese of Basle</h2>

<p>This has taken the place of the old Diocese of Augst (Augusta Rauracorum), the origin of which is obscure; a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Augst was a member of a council held at Cologne in 346. When Augusta Rauracorum sank into decay during the disorders of the migrations the seat of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was transferred to the present Basle (Basilea), founded in 374 by the Emperor Valentinian I. No definite information has been preserved concerning the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The most important <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the early period of the history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is <a href="../cathen/07115a.htm">Hatto</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>, who was a friend of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle from the year 805. He issued a capitulary of great importance for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, resigned his position in 822, and retired to <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> where he died in 836. During the episcopate of Adalbert (999-1025) the foundation of the secular <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Bishops of Basle was laid by the grants made by King Rudolph III of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; the king appointed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> administrator and protector of several religious foundations, bestowed a number of towns and territories on him, and conferred various <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, such as the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>, hunting-rights, etc. Adalbert rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which had been pillaged by the Magyars and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it with much pomp in 1019 in the presence of the Emperor Henry II and his wife. Adalbert's immediate successors Ulrich II (1025-40) and Dietrich (1041-53) were included among the spiritual princes of the Holy Roman Empire. In the period following Adalbert's administration the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was greatly increased, especially through gifts made by the Emperors Henry II, Henry III, and Conrad II.

<p>As princes of the empire the Bishops of Basle were drawn into the struggle between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the empire; most of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> took sides with the emperors against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Berengar (1057-72) promoted, in opposition to <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Antipope Honorius</a> at a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at Basle in 1061; Burkhard of Hasenburg (1071-1107) was one of the most resolute champions of the imperial claims and a faithful partisan of Henry IV whom he accompanied to Canossa. Ortlieb of Froburg (1137-64) went with the Emperor Conrad III on a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to Palestine and took part in the Italian campaigns of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>; Ludwig of Ortlieb was also a partisan of the emperor and of the Antipope Paschal; <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, therefore, deposed him in 1179. Among the succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the most noteworthy were: Henry II of Thun (1238-49), who built the oldest bridge across the Rhine near Basle (replaced in 1904-06 by a new one; Henry of Isny (1275-86), a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, who after 1286 was <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, as was also his successor Peter Rich of Richenstein (1286-96), a devoted partisan of Rudolph of Hapsburg; Peter of Aspelt (1296-1306), later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, who laboured to restore church discipline in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. During the fourteenth century the prestige of the See of Basle declined; many of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> involved the diocese in <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> in various ways; by taking part in the political quarrels, by feuds with the nobles living in Basle, and by quarrels with the city, which was rapidly growing in strength. The city of Basle brought nearly the whole of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over itself from the impecunious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and made itself almost entirely independent of episcopal secular rule. When John II of M&uuml;nsingen (1335-65) was placed under the ban, along with the city of Basle, as a partisan of Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, the citizens of the town threw the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> into the Rhine and forced the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to continue the church services or to leave the place. The earthquake of 1356 destroyed a large part of the city and also did much damage to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. John III of Vienne (1366-82) became involved in a dispute with Bern which led to a quarrel with Basle and the siege of this city by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The increased burden of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> thus caused was a source of great anxiety to the succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, several of whom resigned their office. It was not until the episcopate of John IV of Fleckenstein (1423-36), who held two reform <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> rose again to high reputation. The Council of Basle (1431-49) was held in the city of the same name during this episcopate and that of the following <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Frederick of the Rhine (1436-51). (See <a href="../cathen/02334b.htm">COUNCIL OF BASLE</a>.) The diocese suffered greatly at the time of the struggle of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> confederation with Charles of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; many towns and castles were ravaged and burned during these troubles.

<p>The Diocese of Basle attained its greatest extent in the course of the fifteenth century. The spiritual power of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but not their secular <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, extended over the entire northwestern part of the present <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> lying between the Rivers Aare, Rhine, and Doubs, over the southern part of the present Alsace as far as Rappoltsweiler and Schlettstadt, as well as over some small districts in <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was to rob the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of a large part of their flock. At the beginning of the religious agitation the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was under the rule of Christopher of Utenheim (1502-27), one of the most distinguished of the Prince-Bishop of Basle. He was a friend of the arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and promoter of the new art of printing, then flourishing at Basle. In order to train and reform his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> Bishop Christopher held in 1503 a synod at which excellent <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were issued; he also called learned men as professors and preachers for the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> that had been founded in 1460. This late measure, however, promoted the entry of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. A number of the scholars who had been appointed, as Capito, Pellicanus, Oeeolampadius, and for a time also, <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> and <a href="../cathen/06577a.htm">Glareanus</a>, took sides with the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> and worked for the spread of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Basle became a centre for the printing and dispatch in all directions of the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. Before long the Great Council and the citizens were split into two religious parties and internal disputes were common. Bent from extreme age, Bishop Christopher, in 1527, resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Before his successor Philip of Gundelsheim (1527-53) was able to enter the city, the party advocating the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> obtained control, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> members of the great Council were driven from office, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was declared to be abolished, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were closed, and the churches were plundered. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> changed his place of residence to Pruntrut (Porrentruy); the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter went to Freiburg-in-the-Breisgau and did not return into the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> until 1678 when it established itself at Arlesheim.



<p>Succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> devoted themselves to repairing the severe losses which the diocese had suffered during the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who deserves the greatest credit for the restoration of the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was Jacob Christopher Blarer von Wartensee (1575-1608). He made an alliance offensive and defensive with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in 1580, proclaimed the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, held in 1581 a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod which bore good fruit, and brought back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> numerous subjects who had been estranged from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. He was ably seconded in his labours by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> whom he called in 1591 to Pruntrut and put in charge of the newly founded college. His successors followed in his footsteps, especially Joseph William Rink von Baldenstein (1608-28). In the course of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> the diocese suffered from invasions by the troops of Bernard of Weimar. During the episcopate of Bishop John Conrad von Roggenbach (1656-93) the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter established itself once more in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, at Arlesheim, as has been mentioned above. Bishop Conrad von Reinach (1705-37), who founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and built Castle Delsberg, a residence of the prince-bishops, issued a series of ordinances in 1726 which curtailed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of the land. This caused a revolt that lasted into the episcopate of his successor Jacob Sigmund von Reinach (1737-43) and was only suppressed with the aid of French troops. The three leaders of the revolt were executed in 1740. An estrangement resulted that was not overcome in spite of all the efforts of the succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Joseph William Rink von Baldenstein 91744-62), Simon Nicholas von Froberg (1762-75), and Frederick Ludwig von Wangen-Geroldseck (1775-82).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> put an end to the secular <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The prince-bishopric was occupied by French troops in 1792 and Bishop John Sigmund von Roggenbach (1782-94) fled to <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. His territory was turned into the Rauracian Republic which after four months was incorporated, 1793, in the French Republic. Besides the loss of secular <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had also to forego a large part of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> diocese, for, according to the Concordat made in 1801 between <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, a large part of the Bishopric of Basle was given to the <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a>. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Francis Xavier von Neveu (1794-1828), resided first at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> and then at Offenburg; he ruled only a small territory in the present Cantons of Solothurn, Aargau, and Bern. It was not until 1814 that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> obtained again the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supervision over the larger part of the former prince-bishopric; but his efforts to bring about the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> were unavailing. In 1815 the Congress of Vienna gave the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of the Cantons of Bern and Basle, with the exception of the portion already belonging to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Not long after this, however, the Diocese of Basle was enlarged. After the disorders of the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> era the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> confederation had been reorganized; in order to make it equally independent in Church matters the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> part of the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a> was separated in 1814 from that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and placed provisionally under a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. Long negotiations were entered into between the cantons in the territory of which these portions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> lay, and it was finally resolved to carry out the plan that had been steadily urged by the Canton of Solothurn; this was, to revive the Bishopric of Basle and to define anew its boundaries. The negotiations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were concluded in 1828; the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>, "Inter praecipua Nostri Apostolatus munera", issued 7 May, 1828, settled the boundaries of the new Diocese of Basle, and the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 13 July, 1828, was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> read at Solothurn in the collegiate church of Sts. Ursus and Victor which had been elevated to a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Bishop Francis Xavier von Neveu died a few days later. The new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, which had been appointed, in order to bring it into existence by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, nominated as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> who had formerly been the administrator Apostolic, Anthony Salzmann (1828-54). The new Diocese of Basle, which is directly dependent on the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, embraced at first the Cantons of Lucern, Bern, Solothurn, and Zug; in 1829 Aargau and Thurgau were added; somewhat later Basle, for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> district of Birseek; in 1841 Schaffhausen, first provisionally, and then, in 1858, definitely although without confirmation from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>The germs of many conflicts lay hid in this merely provisional new arrangement and in the uncertainty as to the legal relations of the new see. However, during the episcopate of Bishop Salzmann and that of his immediate successor Charles Arnold (1854-62), the founder of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Solothurn, peace was fairly well preserved. During the episcopate of Eugene Lachat (1863-85) a struggle broke out, caused by the Old-Catholic movement which won many adherents in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The liberal cantons of the Diocese of Basle (all except Lucerne and Zug) closed the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in April, 1870, and forbade the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the decrees of the Council of the Vatican. When in 1871 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, nevertheless, proclaimed these decrees, the majority of the cantons belonging to the diocese voted his deposition, 29 January, 1873, and dissolved the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, 21 December, 1874, which had refused to elect a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, being forced to leave his residence, went to Lucerne which, like the canton of Zug, had protested against the action of the other cantons and had remained faithful to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Here in Lucerne he continued to administer the diocese. His appeals to the federal authorities of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> were rejected and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community was forbidden to have communication with him. It was not until the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> that this unfortunate state of affairs was brought to an end and peace re-established. Bishop Lachat resigned his office in 1885 and was made titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04615b.htm">Damietta</a> and Administrator Apostolic of the newly formed Bishopric of Lugano (see below). He died in 1886. On 19 January, 1885, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> appointed Frederick Fiala <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle (1885-88). The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sought to efface the traces of the late struggle and re-establish the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter; he died 4 May, 1888. Leonard Haas (1888-1906) was appointed to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> 11 July, 1888. Bishop Haas was an eloquent preacher; he encouraged the use of congregational singing and held a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod in 1896. He was followed in 1906 by Dr. Jacob Stammler, born 2 January, 1840, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1863.
<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>The present Diocese of Basle (excluding Lugano) embraces the Cantons of Basle, Bern, <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, Solothurn, Aargau, Thurgau, and Schaffhausen; in 1900 it contained 444,471 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 903,400 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The majority of the inhabitants are Germans, although in the Canton of Bern some 6,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> speak French. For the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into 8 deaneries, 14 rural chapters, 406 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 149 curacies and chaplaincies. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the Cantons of Zug and Schaffhausen are not united in a rural chapter. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> number 660; the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (O.S.B. and O.M.C.) 85. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> senate, which as the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to elect the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, consists of five resident canons (<em>canonici residentiales</em>) and six non-resident canons (<em>canonici forenses</em>); besides these there are seven <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> capitulars, who do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> senate. In 1907 the office of capitular was vacant. There is a collegiate church at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> having an independent <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and 9 canons (in 1907 the <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> were not filled), and a collegiate church at Beromunster with 1 <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and 20 regular canons (the number of canons in 1907 was 17).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are: a cantonal <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> with a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and at Zug St. Michael's boarding-school for boys. The private <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for teachers at Zug is entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in character. In accordance with the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> constitution the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are open to members of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, consequently there are no genuine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In the Cantons of <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> and Zug, which are almost entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, instruction is given in many of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teaching-sisters, who are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to pass a state examination. The male orders and their houses in the Diocese of Basle are as follows: <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, 7 houses with 73 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 19 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and 24 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; the Hermit-Brothers of Luthern, 1 house; the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of Mariastein, who were included in the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> congregation of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, were driven in 1874 from Mariastein and have gone to Durrenberg near Salzburg; the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of Muri have gone for the same reason to Gries near Bozen, and the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of Wittengen to Meherau near Breganz. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders and congregations are more largely represented in the diocese than the male orders. These institutes and their houses are as follows: <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 4; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters, 1; <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, 2; Clares, 1; <a href="../cathen/12374a.htm">Sisters of St. Francis de Sales</a>, 1 house with a boarding-school for girls attached; Sisters of Charity, 5; Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, 1. There are large numbers of the Sisters of the Cross of Ingenbohl, who have charge chiefly of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and who act as attendants on the sick; also of the teaching <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a> of Menzingen, who carry on large institutes for girls at Menzingen, Baldegg, and Cham, and conduct, besides, 250 elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and 45 institutions for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and sick in different parts of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. In addition to the three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls mentioned above, there are similar institutions at Solothurn and <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>. The most important <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Solothurn, which was built, 1762-63, in the style of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>; others worthy of mention are: the collegiate church of <a href="../cathen/09174a.htm">St. Leodegar</a> at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> (built 1633-35); the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Oswald at Zug; the churches of the former <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Fischingen, Kreuzlingen, and Beromunster; the church of the institute at Menzingen, etc. The most frequented <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> are: Mariastein near Basle, and Vorburg near Delsberg. (See <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">SWITZERLAND</a>).
<h2 id="section2">The Diocese of Lugano</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Lugano was erected by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (7 September, 1888). It includes the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Canton of Ticino, where the population is almost entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Italian is the common language. Before the Diocese of Lugano was founded the Canton of Ticino was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were not <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>. The smaller, northern part belonged to the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Archdiocese of Milan</a>, and, consequently, still uses the Ambrosian Rite; the other, and much larger part of the canton, belonged to the <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Diocese of Como</a>. Soon after the formation of the Canton of Ticino, in 1803, efforts were made to separate it in its church relations as well as from foreign powers and to unite it in these with the rest of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. But it was several decades before the Great Council, in 1855, went thoroughly into the matter. Without consultation with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the Federal Council in 1859 declared the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a> and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> to be abolished in the territory of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; after this negotiations were begun with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. No settlement of the question was reached until the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. By the convention of 1 September, 1884, made between the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and the Federal Council, Ticino was canonically separated from its former <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> connections and was placed provisionally, under an administrator Apostolic, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointing as administrator Bishop Lachat of Basle (see above). After Bishop Lachat's death (1886) the new Bishopric of Ticino was formed by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of circumscription "Ad universam" of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (7 September, 1888), and united with the Diocese of Basle under the title of the Diocese of Basle-Lugano. The same year the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Lorenzo was elevated to a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The union is merely a nominal one, for, although the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle is called the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lugano he exercises no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. It is, in reality, under the independent rule of an administrator Apostolic who has the rank and power of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He is appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with the concurrence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle from among the members of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the Canton of Ticino. The first administrator Apostolic was Eugene Lachat; he was followed by Mgr. Vincent Molo (1887-1904), and Mgr. Alfred Peri-Morosini. The latter was born 12 March, 1862, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 17 April, 1904.
<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> census of 1900 the Diocese of Lugano includes 135,200 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in a total population of 142,800 for the Canton of Ticino. For purposes of religious administration the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into 14 episcopal vicariates, 5 rural chapters, and 248 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and chaplaincies; 54 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> use the Ambrosian Rite; the other 194 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. The care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is exercised by 330 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and 22 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists of an arch-priest and 16 canons (10 resident and 6 non-resident). The collegiate churches are: Bellinzona, a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and 14 canons; Agno, a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and 7 canons; Locarno, a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and 8 canons; Balerna, a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and 8 canons, and Mendrisio, a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and 8 canons. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions of learning are: the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Lugano; the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys, Santa Maria near Pollegio; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> academy at Ascona; the College Don Bosco at Bellinzona; the Institute Dante Allighieri, conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14140a.htm">Somaschi</a>, at Bellinzona, and the institute at Olivone. The orders and congregations in the diocese and the number of their houses are as follows: <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, 4 houses; the <a href="../cathen/14140a.htm">Somaschi</a>, 1; <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 1; Augustinian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 1 house, which has an academy in connection with it; <a href="../cathen/03320a.htm">Capuchin nuns</a>, 1; <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, 2 (<a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Lugano and Locarno); School-Sisters of Menzingen, 2 (college at Bellinzona); <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>, 3 (they also conduct an asylum for the deaf and dumb at Locarno); Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, 1; Sisters of the Childhood of Jesus, 1; and the Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, 1. The most noted church of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of San Lorenzo at Lugano, which was built in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and has a celebrated <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>; the most frequented place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> is the shrine Madonna del Sasso not far from Locarno, which is the national shrine of the Canton of Ticino.
