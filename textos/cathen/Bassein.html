<h1>Bassein</h1>  

<p>A town situated twenty-nine miles north of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a> in British <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and now of much historic interest as an old settlement of the Portuguese. It is the birthplace of <a href="../cathen/06379a.htm">St. Gonsalo Garcia</a>, the only Indian saint, who was a companion of St. Philip de las Casas, the first native of America to be <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. These two missionaries were in the group of the first <a href="../cathen/09744a.htm">martyrs of Japan</a>, crucified on the hill of <a href="../cathen/10667c.htm">Nagasaki</a>, 5 February, 1597. Bassein was the most important settlement of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> in the north of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> lying farther to the south. In many respects Bassein was <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa's</a> rival in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as Bombay is of <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a> now. The city of Bassein, in the island of the same name, was founded in 1536 by Nunho de Cunha, one of those intrepid Portuguese soldiers who distinguished themselves in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> as warriors, administrators, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> workers for the spread of the Gospel. He conquered the island from its <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> ruler, Bahadur Shali, King of Gujerat, and soon had a strong fort built in the south-western corner. The island is rich in timber, which was regarded in the sixteenth century as the best material for ship-building. Its fertility and position, together with its healthy climate, made it a commercial centre of some importance, and the home of many Portuguese noblemen.

<p>Side by side with this early conquest and colonization the Gospel was spread by the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionary, Antonio do Porto, to whom is attributed the conversion of 10,156 <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, and who is knows as the "Apostle of Bassein". Father Antonio do Porto built at Aghasshi in the northern Bassein district, as early as 1535, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and maintenance of forty boys, all converts from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, under the invocation of Nossa Senhora da Luz. This <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the first Indian <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> known to history. In April, 1540, a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> force from Gujerat approached the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, on the return from a fruitless attack on the Bassein fort. Nearly all the inmates of the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> had fled for shelter to the fort, but five of them had remained. These were at first urged to renounce their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; failing in this, the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> cruelly tortured them, and locking them in a room set fire to it.

<p>In 1542 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> came to Bassein. <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> visited the city of Bassein three times, once in 1544, and twice in 1548. During his last visit, in December, 1548, he founded the College of the Holy Name of God. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> on their advent divided both the missionary and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, the latter labouring among the lower, and the former among the higher, classes. Other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders also found their way to Bassein, which became the centre of their missionary activity. In the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in the Bassein fort <a href="../cathen/06379a.htm">St. Gonsalo Garcia</a> was brought up from his early youth. He was born about the year 1564. At the age of sixteen he <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> accompanied some of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a> of the college, who were ordered to join the mission of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. He laboured with singular <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> as a catechist for eight years, having acquired the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> language marvellously within a short time. During that time he petitioned to join the order, but as his reception was delayed he left the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> on the best of terms and became a merchant. He was blessed with an abundance of riches which he distributed largely among the poor.

<p>Business interests often took Gonsalo to <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, where he used to visit the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> fathers and assist them as an interpreter in hearing the confessions of some <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. On one occasion, when deep in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he was inspired to seek admission into the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. He did so, and became an exemplary <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>. On 21 May, 1593, he was sent back to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> with a body of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> to aid them in preaching the Gospel. The many conversions made by them caused a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the first <a href="../cathen/09744a.htm">martyrs of Japan</a>. There were twenty-six in number and were crucified on a hill at <a href="../cathen/10667c.htm">Nagasaki</a> 5 February, 1597. They were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1627, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1862.

<p>Bassein was taken from the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> by the Mahrattas in 1739, from the Mahrattas by the English in 1802, and is now a ruined town of much historic interest which no one who goes to Bombay fails to visit. The fort is perhaps the best of the ruined Portuguese fortifications in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. Bassein is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> oasis in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> population of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. It has nine churches, twelve <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 16,119 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> mission was opened in 1904 by the Ritualists but did not flourish and is now practically abandoned.
