<h1>Batavia</h1>  

<p>(Vicariate Apostolic of Batavia)

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> took possession of the island of Java, of which Batavia is the capital, they brought the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> with them; but the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, having conquered Java in 1596, set about the destruction of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Nevertheless, the memory has been preserved of a <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a> who was expelled from Batavia in 1721, and attempted to continue his apostolic labours in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. It was with difficulty that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could enter Java, and, if recognized, he was hunted out. When in 1807 Louis Napoleon became King of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> divided all the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> territory outside of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> into three prefectures, two in the West Indies and the third, with Batavia for its seat, in the East Indies. At this period the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> missionaries James Nelissen and Lambert Preffen set out for the Sunda Islands, and reached Batavia, 4 April, 1808. The Government gave them at first a ruinous <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> place of worship, and then added to this act of generosity sufficiently to enable them to erect a church, which was blessed, under the title of Our Lady of the Assumption, 6 November, 1829. Nelissen died 6 December, 1817, and Preffen succeeded him in this prefecture.

<p>On the 20th of September, 1842, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> raised the Prefecture of Batavia to a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>, and Monsignor Groof, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03249a.htm">Canea</a>, and previously <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a> of Surinam, became the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. A coadjutor was given him, 4 June, 1847, in Monseigneur Pierre-Marie Vrancken, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04128d.htm">Colophon</a>, who succeeded him in 1852. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Government, however, did not leave the first missionaries in peace, and Monsignor Groof, together with Father Van den Brand, a missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, was expelled. Monsignor Vrancken died in 1874, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> then entrusted the mission of Batavia to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> was Monsignor Claessens (1874-93), who was succeeded by Monsignor Staal (1894-97) and Monsignor Luypen, the present (1907) incumbent of the office. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> energetically set about the development of the mission, which then comprised the islands of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, the Sunda group, Timor, the Celebes, and the Moluccas.

<p>In 1851 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the vicariate numbered between 5000 and 6000; in 1879 there were 23,527, not including the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> members of the garrison, and 27 missionaries were labouring in different parts of the Sunda Islands. Although the whole island of Borneo and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/10783a.htm">New Guinea</a> have since been separated form the vicariate, Streit's "Atlas des missions" now gives the following statistics: Total population of the vicariate, 37,325,000; native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, 27,313 (in addition to 25,000 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>); 720 <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>; 54 religious in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders; 40 male religious not priests; 250 Sisters of different orders; 94 catechists; 22 principal stations; 78 secondary stations; 40 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and 59 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 2482 pupils.

<p><a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> had separated the British portions of the islands of Borneo and Labuan from the vicariate in 1855; in 1903 <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> erected <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/10783a.htm">New Guinea</a> into a new prefecture; and <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, in 1905, formed a prefecture out of the remainder of the island of Borneo, again taken from the territory of the vicariate. There still remains of its territory: the island of Sumatra, 181,250 sq. m.; Java, 50,715 sq. m.; the small islands of the Sunda group (Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Sumba, Flores, and Timor) aggregating 36,507 sq. m.; and Celebes, 73.270 sq. m. The Moluccas have been attached to the Prefecture of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/10783a.htm">New Guinea</a>. The Vicariate of Batavia, therefore, now comprises an area of more than 340,000 sq. m., or more than the combined areas of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> and Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The principal stations are: in Sumatra, Medan, in the north-east and Padang, in the west; in Java, Batavia (residence of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>), Samerang, and Surabaya; in Timor, Fialarang; in Flores, Maumeri and Laruntuk; in Celebes, Macassar and Menado. The natives speak their own dialects, but in the coast towns <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> and Malay are the languages current. The <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, established at Batavia and Surabaya, furnish the largest contingent of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the vicariate, amounting to 170.
