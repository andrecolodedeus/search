<h1>Bath Abbey</h1>  

<p>The first religious house in Bath was a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> founded by King Osric, A.D. 676. This was followed by a community of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who were visited and reformed by <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a>. King Edgar was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter in 973, and a few years later the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was <a href="../cathen/05394a.htm">St. Elphege</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, who was killed by the Danes in 1012. &AElig;lfsige, who died in 1087, was the last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bath; for in 1088 William Rufus granted the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and its lands to John de Villula, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wells, and the resident superior was henceforth a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> prior instead of an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. This <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> later restored its lands to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which was endowed also by other benefactors. A great fire, in 1137, destroyed nearly the whole city, greatly damaging the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> buildings, which were promptly rebuilt. In the following century there was a warm dispute between the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Bath and the canons of Wells as to their respective <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in electing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> decreed, in 1245, that the election should be held alternately in either city, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should have a throne in both churches and should be styled Bishop "of <a href="../cathen/02347b.htm">Bath and Wells</a>". This arrangement continued until the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and the subsequent occupants of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> have retained the double title. <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII's</a> Commission visited Bath in August, 1535, and a report of the usual type followed. In 1539 Prior Hollewell surrendered the house and revenues (valued at &#163;617) to the king, and the monastic life of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> came to an end.

<p>The present <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter, occupying only the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of the great Norman fabric, was begun by Prior Birde, about 1500, to replace John de Villula's church, which had fallen into decay. The new church was not finished until 1572, and is thus one of the latest specimens of Perpendicular work in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The latest so-called restoration took place in 1874. No trace remains of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, of which the last portion (probably the prior's lodgings) disappeared in 1755. Since 1679 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission of Bath has been served by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>.
