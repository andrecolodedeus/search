<h1>Bath and Wells</h1>  

<p>B<font size=-2>ADONIENSIS ET</font> W<font size=-2>ELLENSIS</font></p>

<p>(Bath, <em>Aquae Solis, Bathonia, Bathensis, Bathoniensis</em>; Wells, <em>Theoradunum, Velliae, Ecclesia Fontanensis, Vellensis, Wellensis</em>).

<p>Ancient <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> coextensive with the county of Somerset, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bath and Wells, properly so described, was appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1244, but the diocese has a much longer history, though its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> used different titles; Somerset, Wells, Bath, or Bath and Glastonbury, being at different times employed.  &AElig;thelhelm (909-914), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, first exercised episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> there, choosing the secular church of Wells as his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Henceforth, there was a certain rivalry between the secular canons of Wells and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the two great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, Glastonbury and Bath. The advantage, however, lay with the latter and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> at Wells maintained but a struggling existence. During the time of Edward the Confessor (1042-66), the energetic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gisa (1060-88), who on his appointment found the church small and poor, and the few canons who served it forced to beg their bread, succeeded in putting matters on a firmer foundation. He not only erected buildings in which they could live a community life, but obtained grants of lands for their support from <a href="../cathen/05322a.htm">St. Edward the Confessor</a>, Harold, and William the Conqueror. This good work was partly undone by his successor, John de Villula (1088-1122), who removed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Bath, using the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> there as his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. It was not until the appointment of Bishop Robert of Lewes (1136-66), who rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Wells and in other ways proved himself a wise and liberal administrator, that an arrangement was made by which Bath should take precedence of Wells, but that future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should have a throne in both churches and should be elected by the two chapters conjointly. This arrangement lasted through the administrations of Reginald de Bohun (1174-91), who brought <a href="../cathen/07519c.htm">St. Hugh of Lincoln</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; the turbulent <a href="../cathen/13488b.htm">Savaric</a> (1192-1205), who annexed Glastonbury by force; and lastly Jocelin Troteman de Welles (1206-42), who though a native of Wells was known as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bath and Glastonbury until 1219 when he gave up all claim to Glastonbury and styled himself <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bath. But though he omitted Wells from his title, he did more than any other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the town, for he restored and enlarged the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, adding the beautiful west front, increased the number of canons from thirty-five to fifty, and founded a grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. On his death, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Bath ignoring the chapter of Wells, elected as his successor Roger, one of their own community, for whom they obtained royal and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation, but the consequent appeal by the Wells chapter brought about the final settlement of the difficulty. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> decided that Roger should remain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with the style "Bishop of Bath and Wells", and that the old arrangement as to joint election should in future be observed.

<p>The history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was thenceforth tranquil, only three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> during the next two centuries calling for special mention, Ralph of <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a> (1329-63), who completed the buildings; <a href="../cathen/14693a.htm">Thomas Bekynton</a> (1443-65), another liberal benefactor of the city; and Oliver King (1495-1503), who rebuilt Bath Abbey in the Perpendicular style. One <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, William Bytton (1267-74), died with a reputation for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> became a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. In the fifteenth century there were two absentee <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/01160b.htm">Adrian de Castello</a> (1504-18), during whose tenure the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was administered by the historian <a href="../cathen/15353c.htm">Polydore Vergil</a>; and <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a> (1518-23), who held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> simultaneously with that of York. After the dissolution of Bath Abbey in 1538, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, though retaining the old style, had his seat at Wells alone, but final ruin was impending. In 1549 the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> William Barlow was intruded into the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and alienated much of its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. On the accession of Mary he fled, and was succeeded by the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Bishop, <a href="../cathen/02722b.htm">Gilbert Bourne</a> (1554-59), who held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> till he was deprived of it by Elizabeth and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Tower, thus becoming one of the eleven Confessor-Bishop who died in bonds. He died in 1569. Of the twin <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Bath Abbey was rebuilt (1499-1530) in late Perpendicular style and is the last complete monastic building erected before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Wells, though small, is the most perfect example of a secular <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and one of the most beautiful Gothic buildings in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Dating in the main from the early thirteenth, it was practically complete by the middle of the fourteenth century. The diocese contained three archdeaconries, Bath, Wells, and Taunton. The arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were:&mdash; Azure, a saltier quarterly quartered, or and az.
