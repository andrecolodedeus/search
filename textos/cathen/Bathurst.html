<h1>Bathurst</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> situated in New South Wales, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, comprises the territory immediately west of the Dividing Range; it extends north to the Barwon River, is bounded on the west by the Macquarie River as far up as Warren and thence by a line to the Lachlan River twenty miles below Eauabolong.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Bathurst (population in 1901, 9,223) was founded in 1824. Owing to the hostility of the aboriginals and other causes, population filtered slowly into the rich Bathurst plains till the first paying goldfield was discovered in the district, in 1851. The first church in Bathurst, says <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>, "was nothing better than a bark hut". It was superseded in 1861 by a fine new edifice (now the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>), which was erected at a cost of &pound;12,000 by Dean Grant, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Bathurst for nearly twenty years till his death in 1864. In 1865 Bathurst, then part of the Diocese of Sydney, was made the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> centre of a new diocese, which extended from the River Murray to Queensland, and from the Blue Mountains to the border of South Australia. That vast and sparsely populated territory was divided at the time into five missions, ministered to by six <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, with seven small churches and six state-aided <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, attended by 492 pupils. Its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the Right Rev. Matthew Quinn, who had taken an active part in organizing the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Brigade that fought for the defence of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> in 1860. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 14 November, 1865, and reached Bathurst 1 November, 1866, accompanied by five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and seven pioneer <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>. Years of toilsome organization followed &mdash; laborious visitations; opening new missions and supplying them with <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; church, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> extension; the introduction of the (Australian) <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11553a.htm">Patrician Brothers</a>; the founding of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspaper, the "Record"; the erection of St. Stanislaus' College, in 1873, at a cost of &pound;15,000, and of St. Charles' Ecclesiastical Seminary eight years later. Dr. Quinn was a man of great energy, deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, cultivated <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and, says <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>, was one of the "foremost champions of religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in Australia". At his death 16 January, 1885, there were in the diocese 28 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 56 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 21 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, 192 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and 5 religious brothers. Dr. Quinn was succeeded by the Right Rev. Joseph Patrick Byrne (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 9 August, 1885). In 1887 the new <a href="../cathen/15620d.htm">Diocese of Wilcannia</a> was formed out of the Bathurst Diocese. At the same time some districts from the Maitland diocese were added to the Bathurst <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Dr. Byrne, says <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>, "strenuously and successfully carried on the great work of education and religion begun by his predecessor", and, like him, was "a model to his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in his unwearying and self-sacrificing toil". St. Stanislaus' College, which from its foundation had been under the control of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, was in 1888 entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentian</a> Fathers. It is now (1907) one of the foremost <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> in <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, and noted for the work done in its well-equipped physical and chemical laboratories. When pronounced to be stricken by an incurable malady, Dr. Byrne received from his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people, on the Epiphany, 1901, a pathetic demonstration of affection, accompanied by a money gift of &pound;2,530. He passed away on the 12th of January, 1901. To him succeeded the Right Rev. John Dunne &mdash; builder, missioner, organizer &mdash; who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 8 September, 1901. He is to complete the architecturally fine college of St. Stanislaus, and under his administration the missionary and scholastic traditions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are well sustained. The efficiency of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is in no small measure due to the system of inspection inaugurated by the Rev. J. J.  Brophy, D. D., LL. B. The principal lay benefactors of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are Mr. James Dalton, K.S.G., and Mr. John Meagher, K.S.G.
<h2>Religious statistics</h2>

<p>In the diocese there are: 18 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> districts; 89 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; 29 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 7 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; 7 religious brothers; 242 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 1 college; 8 boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls; 11 day high schools; 39 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (with 3,496 pupils); 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>; 4,298 children in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of about 27,000.
