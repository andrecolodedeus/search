<h1>Bayeux</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF BAYEUX (B<font size=-2>AJOC&#198;</font>).

<p>Coextensive with the Department of Calvados; suffragan to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. At the time of the Concordat (1862) the ancient Diocese of Lisieux was united to that of Bayeux. A pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, in 1854, authorized the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bayeux to call himself <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bayeux and Lisieux.
<h2>The See of Bayeux</h2>

<p>A local legend, found in the breviaries of the fifteenth century, makes <a href="../cathen/05731a.htm">St. Exuperius</a>, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bayeux, an immediate disciple of St. Clement, and his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> a foundation of the first century. St. Regnobertus, the same legend tells us, was the successor of <a href="../cathen/05731a.htm">St. Exuperius</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> and M. Jules Lair have shown how little ground there is for this legend; it was only towards the middle of the fourth century that <a href="../cathen/05731a.htm">St. Exuperius</a> founded the See of Bayeux; after him the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> St. Reverendus did much for the propagation of the Faith in these parts. A certain number of the successors of <a href="../cathen/05731a.htm">St. Exuperius</a> were <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: Rufinianus; Lupus (about 465); Vigor (beginning of the sixth century), who destroyed a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> temple, then still frequented; Regnobertus (about 629), who founded many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and whom the legend, owing to an anachronism, made first successor to Exuperius; and Hugues (d. 730), simultaneously <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of two other sees, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. We may also mention Odon of Conteville (1050-97), brother of William the Conqueror, who built the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was present at the Battle of Hastings, intrigued for the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> on the death of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (1085), and died a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusader</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>; Cardinal Trivulce (1531-48), <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in the Roman Campagna during the siege and pillage of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the Constable de Bourbon; Cardinal d'Ossai (1602-04), an illustrious diplomatist prominently identified with the conversion of Henry IV. Claude Fauchet, who after being court preacher to Louis XVI, became one of the "conquerors" of the Bastille, was chosen Constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bayeux in 1791, and was beheaded 31 October, 1793. Mgr. Arnette, coadjutor, with right of succession to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was, until 1905, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bayeux. In the municipal Mus&eacute;e Arch&eacute;ologique is preserved the famous "Bayeux Tapestry", one of the most remarkable <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> textile art. Its contemporary <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroideries</a> reproduce scenes from the Norman Conquest of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1066) and are valuable as illustrations of eleventh-century costume and life.
<h2>The See of Lisieux</h2>

<p>The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lisieux is Theodibandes, mentioned in connexion with a council held in 538. The most celebrated among his successors were Freculfus (d. 850), a pupil of the palace <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and author of a universal history; Arnoul (1141-81), statesman and writer; Nicole Oresne (1378-82), <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, mathematician, and tutor to Charles V; Pierre Cauchon (1432-42), concerned in the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>; Thomas Basin (1447-74), the historian of Charles VII, and one of the promoters of the rehabilitation of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>; Guillaume du Vair (1618-21), the well-known <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> who left the bench for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> both sees were very important. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bayeux was senior among the Norman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the chapter was one of the richest in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The See of Lisieux maintained the Coll&eacute;ge de Lisieux at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for poor students of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Important councils were held within this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>, in 1042 and 1061; in the latter was proclaimed <a href="../cathen/15068a.htm">"the Truce of God"</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at Bayeux about 1300, furnish a very fair <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the discipline of the time.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of the Diocese of Bayeux should be mentioned those of St. Stephen (Abbaye-aux-Hommes) and of the Trinity (Abbaye-aux-Dames), both founded at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a> by William the Conqueror (1029-87) and his wife Matilda, in expiation of their unlawful marriage. The former of these <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> was governed by the celebrated <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were those of Troarn of which Durand, the successful opponent of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>, was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in the eleventh century, and the Abbaye du Val, of which Ranc&eacute; was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, in 1661, prior to his reform of La Trappe. The Abbey of St. Evroul (Ebrulphus) in the Diocese of Lisieux, founded about 560 by St. Evroul, a native of Bayeux, is famous as the home of <a href="../cathen/11278a.htm">Ordericus Vitalis</a>, the chronicler (1075-1141). Venerable Jean Eudes founded in 1641 in Caen the congregation of Notre Dame de Charit&eacute; du Refuge, which is devoted to the protection of girls and includes 33 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and elsewhere. At Tilly, in the Diocese of Bayeux, Michel Vingtras established, in 1839, the politico-religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> known as <em>La Mis&eacute;ricorde,</em> in connexion with the survivors of <em>La Petite &Eacute;glise,</em> which was condemned in 1843 by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. Daniel Huet, the famous savant (1630-1721) and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avranches, was a native of Caen.

<p>At the close of the year 1905 the Diocese of Bayeux included a population of 410,178, 73 pastorates, 640 mission churches, and 120 curacies remunerated by the State. According to the latest statistics (1907) obtainable, the Diocese of Bayeux has 2 <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylums</a>, 16 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 deaf-mute institute, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> where farming is taught, 9 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 4 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 trades <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 refuge for young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and hospices, 1 dispensary, 4 communities for the care of the sick in their homes, 3 private <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 1 private insane asylum, 9 homes for the aged, all conducted by sisters; and 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> where farming is taught, conducted by brothers.

<p>In 1900 the following congregations were represented in the diocese: the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, who have an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Juaye-Mondaye. Among the local congregations are the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> missionaries, stationed at the basilica of Notre Dame de la D&eacute;liverande, directors of several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> throughout the diocese. In this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> also was founded the congregation of Our Lady of Charity and Refuge established at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a> in 1641 by Venerable Jean Eudes for the preservation of young girls. This congregation has 33 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and other countries.
