<h1>Bayonne</h1>  

<p>(Lapurdum)

<p>The Diocese of Bayonne comprises the Department of Basses-Pyrenees. Reorganized in 1802, it included, besides certain <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/16032b.htm">Diocese of Dax</a> and Tarbes, the Diocese of Oloron and Lescar. It was suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Archiepiscopal See of Toulouse</a> from 1802 to 1822, thereafter to that of <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a>.
<h2>Diocese of Bayonne</h2>

<p>Local tradition maintains that St. Leo, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, with whose memory is associated a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> fountain, was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bayonne. No <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is historically known prior to the sixth century, although some think that Bayonne, designated as <em>civitas</em> in the Treaty of Andelot (587), must have had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at that time, whilst others couple the foundation of the See of Bayonne with the establishment of the Kingdom of Aquitaine (778). Until 1655, the Diocese of Bayonne included much Spanish territory, i.e. the four Archpresbyteries of Bastan, Lerin, Cinco Villas in <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, and Fontarabia in Guipuzcoa, a remnant of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> conquests beyond the Pyrenees. Christopher de Beaumont, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, occupied the See of Bayonne from 1741 to 1745 and <a href="../cathen/02031a.htm">Astros</a> occupied it from 1820 to 1830.
<h2>Sees of Lescar and Oloron</h2>

<p>A local legend recorded in the great "Breviairede Lescar" of 1541, and patterned after the Limousin legend of <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a>, holds that St. Julian, sent from <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> by <a href="../cathen/09179b.htm">St. Leontius</a>, was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lescar; but according to history, St. Galactorius, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> perhaps by the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> after their defeat at Vouille, and St. Gratus, both mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> (506), were respectively the first incumbents of the See of Lescar and the See of Oloron known to history. Until 1789 the Bishops of Lescar presided by right over the Assembly of the States of Bearn. Amongst those who occupied the See of Oloron was Roussel, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> (1536-50), prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Margaret of Navarre and a convert to <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/14235a.htm">Sponde</a> (Spondanus, 1568-1643), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">Pamiers</a>, who carried on the work of <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>; <a href="../cathen/05218a.htm">Duvergier de Hauranne</a> (1581-1643), Abb&eacute; de St. Cyran, the second founder of Jensenism, and <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a> were born in territory now included in the Diocese of Bayonne. Betharram is celebrated as a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> as also are Notre Dame de Pietat, at Paradies, and Notre Dame de Sarrance, visited by King Louis XI. In 1899 the following institutions were to be found in the diocese: 1 <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylum</a>, 38 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> where farming is taught, 10 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 5 gratuitous industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 houses of refuge for young girls, 2 <em>patronages</em>, 1 temporary home for servants, 4 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or hospices, 1 insane asylum, 6 homes for the aged, and 1 private <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, all conducted by Sisters, and 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> where farming is taught, conducted by Brothers, and 4 <em>patronages</em> for young people conducted either by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or brothers. At the close of 1905 the Diocese of Bayonne contained 426,347 inhabitants, 43 pastorates, 449 <em>succursales</em> or mission churches, and 91 curacies.

<p>In 1900 the following <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were represented in the diocese: the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Pau, and the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> at Bayonne. Among the local congregations are: the Auxiliary Priests of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, devoted to teaching and missionary work, founded at Betharram in 1841. They have missions at <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Ayres</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10539a.htm">Montevideo</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servants of Mary</a>, who teach and serve in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; their mother-house is at Anglet. The <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a>, with mother-house also at Anglet, were founded in 1846; they keep perpetual silence and divide their time between <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and work of sewing and <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>.
