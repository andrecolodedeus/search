<h1>Beatification and Canonization</h1>  

<h2>History</h2>

<p>According to some writers the origin of beatification and canonization in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is to be traced back to the ancient <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/01650b.htm"><em>apotheosis</em></a>. In his classic work on the subject (<em>De Servorum Dei Beatificatione et Beatorum Canonizatione</em>) <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> examines and at the very outset refutes this view. He shows so well the substantial differences between them that no right-thinking <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> need henceforth confound the two institutions or derive one from the other. It is a matter of history who were elevated to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/01650b.htm">apotheosis</a>, on what grounds, and by whose authority; no less clear is the meaning that was attached to it. Often the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was due to the statement of a single <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (possibly bribed or enticed by promises, and with a view to fix the <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> more securely in the minds of an already <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> people) that while the body of the new god was being burned, an eagle, in the case of the emperors, or a peacock (Juno's sacred bird), in the case of their consorts, was seen to carry heavenward the spirit of the departed (Livy, Hist. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, I, xvi; Herodian, Hist. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, IV, ii, iii). <a href="../cathen/01650b.htm">Apotheosis</a> was awarded to most members of the imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> it was the exclusive privilege. No regard was had to virtues or remarkable achievements. Recourse was frequently had to this form of deification to escape popular <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> by distracting attention from the cruelty of imperial rulers. It is said that Romulus was <a href="../cathen/01650b.htm">deified</a> by the senators who slew him; Poppaea owed her <a href="../cathen/01650b.htm">apotheosis</a> to her imperial paramour, <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, after he had kicked her to death; Geta had the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> from his brother <a href="../cathen/03328c.htm">Caracalla</a>, who had got rid of him through jealousy.

<p>Canonization in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is quite another thing. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> canonizes or beatifies only those whose lives have been marked by the exercise of <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtue</a>, and only after this has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by common repute for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and by conclusive arguments. The chief difference, however, lies in the meaning of the term <em>canonization</em>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> seeing in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> nothing more than friends and servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whose holy lives have made them worthy of His special <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. She does not pretend to make gods (cf. Eusebius Emisenus, Serm. de S. Rom. M.; Augustine, <a href="../fathers/120122.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXII.10</a>; Cyrill. Alexandr., Contra Jul., lib. VI; Cyprian, De Exhortat. martyr.; Conc. Nic., II, act. 3).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> origin of canonization and beatification must be sought in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of the worship (<em>cultus</em>), invocation, and intercession of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. As was taught by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (Quaest. in Heptateuch., lib. II, n. 94; <a href="../fathers/140620.htm"><em>Reply to Faustus</em> XX.21</a>), <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, while giving to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone adoration strictly so-called, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> because of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">Divine supernatural gifts</a> which have earned them eternal life, and through which they reign with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly fatherland</a> as His chosen friends and faithful servants. In other words, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as the loving distributor of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a>. The worship of <a href="../cathen/09036a.htm"><em>latria</em></a> (<em>latreia</em>), or strict adoration, is given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone; the worship of <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm"><em>dulia</em></a> (<em>douleia</em>), or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> reverence, is paid the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; the worship of <em>hyperdulia</em> (<em>hyperdouleia</em>), a higher form of <em>dulia</em>, belongs, on account of her greater excellence, to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Augustine, <a href="../fathers/140620.htm"><em>Reply to Faustus</em> XX.21</a>; cf. <a href="../fathers/120122.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXII.10</a>) erects her altars to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, though in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and memory of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. There is Scriptural warrant for such worship in the passages where we are bidden to venerate <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (<a href="../bible/exo023.htm#vrs20">Exodus 23:20 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/jos005.htm#vrs13">Joshua 5:13 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/dan008.htm#vrs15">Daniel 8:15 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/dan010.htm#vrs4">10:4</a> sqq.; <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs9">Luke 2:9 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs7">Acts 12:7 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/rev005.htm#vrs11">Revelation 5:11 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/rev007.htm#vrs1">7:1 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs10">Matthew 18:10</a>; etc.), whom holy men are not unlike, as sharers of the friendship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> beseeches the brethren (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs30">Romans 15:30</a>; <a href="../bible/2co001.htm#vrs11">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href="../bible/col004.htm#vrs3">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="../bible/eph006.htm#vrs18">Ephesians 6:18-19</a>) to help him by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for him to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must with even greater reason maintain that we can be helped by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and ask their intercession with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. If we may beseech those who still live on earth, why not those who live in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>?



<p>It is objected that the invocation of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is opposed to the unique mediatorship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. There is indeed "one mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man, the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>". But He is our mediator in His quality of our common Redeemer; He is not our sole intercessor nor advocate, nor our sole mediator by way of supplication. In the eleventh session of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451) we find the Fathers exclaiming, "Flavianus lives after death! May the Martyr <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us!" If we accept this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the worship of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, of which there are innumerable evidences in the writings of the Fathers and the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western</a> Churches, we shall not wonder at the loving care with which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> committed to writing the sufferings of the early <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, sent these accounts from one gathering of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to another, and promoted the veneration of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.

<p>Let one instance suffice. In the circular epistle of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.23</a>) we find mention of the religious celebration of the day on which <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a> suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> (23 February, 155); and the words of the passage exactly express the main purpose which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has in the celebration of such anniversaries:<blockquote><p>We have at last gathered his bones, which are dearer to us than priceless gems and purer than gold, and laid them to rest where it was befitting they should lie. And if it be possible for us to assemble again, may <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant us to celebrate the birthday of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, thus to recall the memory of those who fought in the glorious combat, and to teach and strengthen by his example, those who shall come after us. </p></blockquote>

<p>This anniversary celebration and veneration of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> was a service of thanksgiving and congratulation, a token and an evidence of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of those who engaged in it (Muratori, de Paradiso, x), and its general diffusion explains why <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, though asserting with the Chiliasts that the departed just would obtain eternal glory only after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection of the body</a>, admitted an exception for the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (<em>De Resurrectione Carnis</em>, xliii).

<p>It must be obvious, however, that while private moral <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and possession of heavenly glory may suffice for private veneration of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, it cannot suffice for public and common acts of that kind. No member of a social body may, independently of its authority, perform an act proper to that body. It follows naturally that for the public veneration of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and rulers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was constantly required. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had at heart, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, but she did not therefore grant <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> honours indiscriminately to all those who had died for the Faith. <a href="../cathen/11262b.htm">St. Optatus of Mileve</a>, writing at the end of the fourth century, tells us (De Schism, Donat., I, xvi, in P.L., XI, 916-917) of a certain noble lady, Lucilla, who was reprehended by Caecilianus, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Carthage, for having <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> before <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> the bones of one who was either not a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> or whose right to the title was unproved.

<p>The decision as to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> having died for his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the consequent permission of worship, lay originally with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place in which he had borne his testimony. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> inquired into the motive of his death and, finding he had died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, sent his name with an account of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> to other churches, especially neighboring ones, so that, in event of approval by their respective <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the cultus of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> might extend to their churches also, and that the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, as we read of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius</a> in the "Acts" of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> (Ruinart, Acta Sincera Martyrum, 19) "might hold communion with the generous <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<em>generoso Christi martyri communicarent</em>). Martyrs whose cause, so to speak, had been discussed, and the fame of whose <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> had been confirmed, were known as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (<em>vindicati</em>) <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. As far as the word is concerned it may probably not antedate the fourth century, when it was introduced in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>; but the fact is certainly older. In the earlier ages, therefore, this worship of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> was entirely local and passed from one church to another with the permission of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This is clear from the fact that in none of the <a href="../cathen/03510a.htm">ancient Christian cemeteries</a> are there found <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> other than those who had suffered in that neighborhood. It explains, also, almost the universal veneration very quickly paid to some <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, e.g., <a href="../cathen/09089a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian of Carthage</a>, <a href="../cathen/14031b.htm">Pope St. Sixtus of Rome</a> [Duchesne, Origines du culte chr&eacute;tien (Paris, 1903), 284].

<p>The worship of <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessors</a> &#151; of those, that is, who died peacefully after a life of <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtue</a> &#151; is not as ancient as that of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The word itself takes on a different meaning after the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> periods. In the beginning it was given to those who confessed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when examined in the presence of enemies of the Faith (<a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, in his notes to Ro. Mart., 1 January, D), or, as <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> explains (op. cit., II, c. ii, n. 6), to those who died peacefully after having confessed the Faith before tyrants or other enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, and undergone tortures or suffered other punishments of whatever nature. Later on, confessors were those who had lived a holy life and closed it by a holy death in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peace. It is in this sense that we now treat of the worship paid to confessors.

<p>It was in the fourth century, as is commonly held, that confessors were first given public <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, though occasionally praised in ardent terms by earlier Fathers, and although an abundant rewards (<em>multiplex corona</em>) is declared by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> to be theirs (De Zelo et Livore, col. 509; cf. Innoc. III, De Myst. Miss., III, x; <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, op. cit., I, v, no 3 sqq; <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, De Miss&acirc;, II, xx, no 5). Still <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> thinks it uncertain when confessors began to be objects of cultus, and asserts that it was not before 800, when the feasts of Sts. <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">Martin</a> and <a href="../cathen/12763b.htm">Remigius</a> are found in the catalogue of feasts drawn up by the Council of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. This opinion of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> is confirmed by the implicit approval of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (Dial., I, xiv, and III, xv) and by well attested facts; in the East, for example, <a href="../cathen/07347a.htm">Hilarion</a> (<a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, III, xiv, and VIII, xix), <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">Ephrem</a> (Greg. Nyss., Orat. in laud. S. Ephrem), and other confessors were publicly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the fourth century; and, in the West, <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, as is gathered plainly from the oldest <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviaries</a> and the Mozarabic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (Bona, Rer. Lit., II, xii, no. 3), and <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">St. Hilary of Poitiers</a>, as can be shown from the very ancient Mass-book known as "Missale Francorum", were objects of a like cultus in the same century (<a href="../cathen/09723b.htm">Martigny</a>, Dictionnaire des antiquit&eacute;s chr&eacute;tiennes, s.v. Confesseurs).

<p>The reason of this veneration lies, doubtless, in the resemblance of the confessors' self-denying and <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroically virtuous</a> lives to the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; such lives could truly be called prolonged <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>. Naturally, therefore, such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was first paid to ascetics (Duchesne, op. cit., 284) and only afterwards to those who resembled in their lives the very penitential and extraordinary existence of the ascetics. So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is this that the confessors themselves are frequently called <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> calls <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (Orat. de laud., P.L., XXXVI, 602); <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> applies the same title to Eustachius of Antioch (Opp. II, 606); <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a> writes of <a href="../cathen/06033b.htm">St. Felix of Nola</a> that he won heavenly honours, <em>sine sanguine <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a></em> ("a bloodless <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>" &#151; Poem., XIV, Carm. III, v, 4); <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> styles <a href="../cathen/15754d.htm">Zeno of Verona</a> a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (Dial. III. xix), and Metronius gives to St. Roterius (Acta SS., II, May 11, 306) the same title. Later on, the names of confessors were inserted in the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, and due reverence was paid them. Their <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> (<a href="../cathen/09723b.htm">Martigny</a>, loc. cit.) with the same title (<em>martyria</em>) as those of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. It remained <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, however, at all times that it was unlawful to venerate confessors without permission of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority as it had been so to venerate <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, loc. cit., vi).

<p>We have seen that for several centuries the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in some places only the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> and <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> (August., Brevic. Collat. cum Donatistis, III, xiii, no 25 in P.L., XLIII, 628), could grant to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and confessors public <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, however, was always decreed only for the local territory over which the grantors held <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Still, it was only the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome's</a> acceptance of the cultus that made it universal, since he alone could permit or command in the Universal Church [Gonzalez Tellez, Comm. Perpet. in singulos textus libr. Decr. (III, xlv), in cap. i, De reliquiis et vener. Sanct.]. Abuses, however, crept into this form of discipline, due as well to indiscretions of popular fervour as to the carelessness of some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in inquiring into the lives of those whom they permitted to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Towards the close of the eleventh century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to restrict episcopal authority on this point, and decreed that the <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> proposed for public veneration should be examined in councils, more particularly in <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>. <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Calixtus II</a>, and Eugenius III followed this line of action. It happened, even after these decrees, that "some, following the ways of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and deceived by the <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> a man who had been killed while intoxicated". <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1159-81) took occasion to prohibit his veneration in these words: "For the future you will not presume to pay him reverence, as, even though <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were worked through him, it would not allow you to revere him as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> unless with the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>" (c. i, tit. cit., X. III, xlv). <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> do not agree as to the full import of this <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a>. Either a new law was made (<a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, De Eccles. Triumph., I, viii), in which case the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then for the first time reserved the right of beatification, or a pre-existing law was confirmed. As the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a> did not put an end to all controversy, and some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> did not obey it in as far as it regarded beatification (which right they had certainly possessed hitherto), <a href="../cathen/15218a.htm">Urban VII</a> published, in 1634, a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> which put an end to all discussion by reserving to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> exclusively not only its immemorial right of canonization, but also that of beatification.
<h2>Nature of beatification and canonization</h2>

<p>Before dealing with the actual procedure in causes of beatification and canonization, it is proper to define these terms precisely and briefly in view of the preceding considerations.

<p>Canonization, generally speaking, is a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> regarding the public <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> veneration of an individual. Such veneration, however, may be permissive or preceptive, may be universal or local. If the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> contains a precept, and is universal in the sense that it binds the whole Church, it is a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <em>canonization</em>; if it only permits such worship, or if it binds under precept, but not with regard to the whole Church, it is a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <em>beatification.</em>

<p>In the ancient <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, probably even as late as <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could in their several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> allow public veneration to be paid to <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and such episcopal decrees were not merely permissive, but, in my opinion, preceptive. Such decrees, however, could not prescribe universal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; the effect of an episcopal act of this kind, was equivalent to our modern beatification. In such cases there was, properly speaking, no canonization, unless with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> extending the cultus in question, implicitly or explicitly, and imposing it by way of precept upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at large. In the more recent discipline beatification is a permission to venerate, granted by the Roman Pontiffs with restriction to certain places and to certain <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> exercises. Thus it is unlawful to pay to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> known as <a href="../cathen/02597b.htm">Blessed</a> (i.e. the <em>Beatus</em>, Beatified), public reverence outside of the place for which the permission is granted, or to recite an office in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, or to celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> referring to him, unless special <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> be had; similarly, other methods of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> have been interdicted. Canonization is a precept of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> commanding public veneration to be paid an individual by the Universal Church. To sum up, beatification, in the present discipline, differs from canonization in this: that the former implies (1) a locally restricted, not a universal, permission to venerate, which is (2) a mere permission, and no precept; while canonization implies a universal precept.

<p>In exceptional cases one or other element of this distinction may be lacking; thus, <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> not only allowed but ordered the public cultus of Bl. William of Malavalle in the <a href="../cathen/07039a.htm">Diocese of Grosseto</a>, and his action was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>; <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> acted similarly with regard to Bl. <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> for the city and district of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>; <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> with regard to <a href="../cathen/13192c.htm">Bl. Rose of Lima</a>, when he selected her as principal patron of <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> and of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>; and <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, by making her patron of all America, the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, and the Indies. <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> also chose <a href="../cathen/14245b.htm">Bl. Stanislaus Kostka</a> as patron of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, and the allied provinces. Again, in respect to universality, <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> permitted the cultus of Bl. John Boni for the Universal Church. In all these instances there was only beatification. The cultus of <a href="../cathen/13192c.htm">Bl. Rose of Lima</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, was general and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> for America, but, lacking complete preceptive universality, was not strictly speaking canonization (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, op. sit., I, xxxix).

<p>Canonization, therefore, creates a cultus which is universal and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>. But in imposing this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may, and does, use one of two methods, each constituting a new species of canonization, i.e. <em>formal canonization</em> and <em>equivalent canonization.</em> Formal canonization occurs when the cultus is prescribed as an explicit and definitive decision, after due judicial process and the ceremonies usual in such cases. Equivalent canonization occurs when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, omitting the judicial process and the ceremonies, orders some servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the Universal Church; this happens when such a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> has been from a remote period the object of veneration, when his <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtues</a> (or <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>) and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are related by reliable historians, and the fame of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> intercession is uninterrupted. Many examples of such canonization are to be found in <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>; e.g. Saints <a href="../cathen/13179b.htm">Romuald</a>, <a href="../cathen/11100b.htm">Norbert</a>, <a href="../cathen/03014b.htm">Bruno</a>, <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">Peter Nolasco</a>, <a href="../cathen/12671b.htm">Raymond Nonnatus</a>, John of Matha, <a href="../cathen/06033c.htm">Felix of Valois</a>, <a href="../cathen/09655c.htm">Queen Margaret of Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/14287a.htm">King Stephen of Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/15587b.htm">Wenceslaus Duke of Bohemia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>. Such instances afford a good <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the caution with which the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> proceeds in these equivalent canonizations. <a href="../cathen/13179b.htm">St. Romuald</a> was not canonized until 439 years after his death, and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> came to him sooner than to any of the others mentioned. We may add that this equivalent canonization consists usually in the ordering of an <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and that mere enrollment in the Roman Martyrology does not by any means imply this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, l, c., xliii, no 14).
<h2>Papal infallibility and canonization</h2>

<p>Is the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in issuing a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of canonization? Most <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> answer in the affirmative. It is the opinion of <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a>, Melchior Cano, <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Suarez</a>, <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, <a href="../cathen/02247a.htm">Ba&ntilde;ez</a>, Vasquez, and, among the canonists, of Gonzales Tellez, Fagnanus, <a href="../cathen/01326b.htm">Schmalzgr&uuml;ber</a>, <a href="../cathen/02287b.htm">Barbosa</a>, <a href="../cathen/12724c.htm">Reiffenst&uuml;l</a>, Covarruvias (Variar. resol., I, x, no 13), Albitius (De Inconstanti&acirc; in fide, xi, no 205), Petra (Comm. in Const. Apost., I, in notes to Const. I, Alex., III, no 17 sqq.), Joannes a S. Thom&acirc; (on II-II, Q. I, disp. 9, a. 2), Silvester (Summa, s.v. Canonizatio), Del Bene (De Officio Inquisit. II, dub. 253), and many others. In Quodlib. IX, a. 16, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> says: "Since the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> we pay the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is in a certain sense a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, i.e., a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the glory of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saints</a> [<em>qu&acirc; sanctorum gloriam credimus</em>] we must piously believe that in this matter also the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not liable to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>." These words of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, as is evident from the authorities just cited, all favouring a positive <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, have been interpreted by his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in favour of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> in the matter of canonization, and this interpretation is supported by several other passages in the same Quodlibet. This <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, however according to the holy doctor, is only a point of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> generally agree as to the fact of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> in this matter of canonization, but disagree as to the quality of certitude due to a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> in such matter. In the opinion of some it is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<a href="../cathen/01753b.htm">Arriaga</a>, De fide, disp. 9, p. 5, no 27); others hold that to refuse assent to such a judgment of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> would be both impious and rash, as Francisco Su&aacute;rez (De fide, disp. 5 p. 8, no 8); many more (and this is the general view) hold such a pronouncement to be theologically certain, not being of Divine Faith as its purport has not been immediately revealed, nor of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Faith as having thus far not been <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>What is the object of this <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>? Does he define that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> canonized is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or only that he has practiced <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">Christian virtues</a> in an <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic degree</a>? I have never seen this question discussed; my own opinion is that nothing else is defined than that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> canonized is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. The formula used in the act of canonization has nothing more than this:<blockquote><p>"In <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of . . . we <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and define that Blessed N. is a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Saint</a>, and we inscribe his name in the catalogue of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and order that his memory by devoutly and piously celebrated yearly on the . . . day of . . . his feast."

<p>(Ad honorem . . . beatum N. Sanctum esse decernimus et definimus ac sanctorum catalogo adscribimus statuentes ab ecclesi&acirc; universali illius memoriam quolibet anno, die ejus natali . . . pi&acirc; devotione recoli debere.) </p></blockquote>

<p>There is no question of <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtue</a> in this formula; on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> does not necessarily imply the exercise of <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtue</a>, since one who had not hitherto practised <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtue</a> would, by the one transient heroic act in which he yielded up his life for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have justly deserved to be considered a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. This view seems all the more certain if we reflect that all the arguments of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> for <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> in the canonization of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are based on the fact that on such occasions the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> believe and assert that the decision which they publish is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> (<a href="../cathen/11739b.htm">Pesch</a>, Prael. Dogm., I, 552).

<p>This general agreement of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> as to <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> in canonization must not be extended to beatification, not withstanding the contrary teaching of the canonical commentary known as "Glossa" [in cap. un. de reliquiis et venerat. SS. (III, 22) in 6; Innocent., Comm. in quinque Decretalium libros, tit. de reliquiis, etc., no 4; Ostiensis in eumd. tit. no 10; Felini, cap. lii, De testibus, etc., X (II, 20); Caietani, tract. De indulgentiis adversus Lutherum ad Julium Mediceum; Augustini de Ancona, seu Triumphi, De potestate eccl., Q. xiv, a. 4). Canonists and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> generally deny the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> character of decrees of beatification, whether formal or equivalent, since it is always a permission, not a command; while it leads to canonization, it is not the last step. Moreover, in most cases, the cultus permitted by beatification, is restricted to a determined province, city, or religious body (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, op. cit., I, xlii). Some, however, have thought otherwise (<a href="../cathen/01753b.htm">Arriaga</a>, Theol., V, disp. 7, p. 6; Amicus, Theol., IV, disp. 7, p. 4, no 98; Turrianus on II-II, V, disp. 17, no 6; Del Bene, De S. Inquisit. II, dub. 254).
<h2>Present procedure in causes of beatification and canonization</h2>

<p>We must first distinguish causes of martyrs from those of confessors or <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, since the method followed is not entirely identical in both cases.
<h3>The beatification of confessors</h3>

<p>In order to secure beatification (the most important and difficult step in the process of canonization) the regular procedure is as follows: <ol> <li>Choosing of a vice-postulator by the postulator-general of the cause, to promote all the judicial inquiries <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in places outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Such inquiries are instituted by the local episcopal authority. <li>The preparation of the inquiries (<em>processus</em>) all of which are carried on by the ordinary episcopal authority. They are of three kinds: (a) <em>Informative</em> inquiries regard the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only in general, but also in particular instances; there may be several such inquiries if the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> to be examined belong to different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. (b) Processes <em>de non cultu</em> are instituted to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> regarding the prohibition of public <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">worship</a> of servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before their beatification have been <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>; they are generally conducted by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place where the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are preserved. (c) Other inquiries are known as <em>Processiculi diligentiarum</em> and have for their object the writings attributed to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose beatification is in question; they vary in number according to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> where such writings are found, or are thought likely to be found, and may not be judicially executed before an "Instruction" is obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12454a.htm">promotor of the Faith</a> by the postulator-general and by him sent to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in question. <li>The results of all these inquiries are sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to the Congregation of Rites, in charge of a messenger (<em>portitor</em>) chosen by the judges, or by some other secure way, in case a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of the congregation <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispenses</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of sending a messenger. <li>They are opened, translated if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> into Italian, a public copy is made, and a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> is deputed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <em>relator</em> or <em>ponens</em> of the cause, for all which steps <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a> of the congregation, confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, must be obtained. <li>The writings of the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are next revised by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> appointed by the cardinal relator himself, authorized to so act by a special <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a>. Meantime, the advocate and the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the cause, chosen by the postulator-general, have prepared all the documents that concern the introduction of the cause (<em>positio super introductione causae</em>). These consist of (a) a summary of the informative processes, (b) an information, (c) answers to the observations or difficulties of the <a href="../cathen/12454a.htm">promotor of the Faith</a> sent by him to the Postulator. <li>This collection of documents (<em>positio</em>) is printed and distributed to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the Congregation of Rites forty days before the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> assigned for their discussion. <li>If nothing contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> is found in the writings of the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> is published, authorizing further action (<em>quod in caus&acirc; procedi possit ad ulteriora</em>), i.e., the discussion of the matter (<em>dubium</em>) of appointment or non-appointment of a <a href="../cathen/04164c.htm">commission</a> for the introduction of the cause. <li>At the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> fixed by the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Congregation</a> of Rites an ordinary meeting (<em>congregatio</em>) is held in which this appointment is debated by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the aforesaid congregation and its officials, but without the vote or participation of the consultors, though this <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> is always granted them by <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a>. <li>If in this meeting the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> favour the appointment of the aforesaid commission, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to that effect is <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> signs it, but, according to <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a>, with his <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a>, not with that of his pontificate. Thenceforward the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is judicially given the title of Venerable. <li>A petition is then presented asking remissorial letters for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em> (outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), authorizing them to set on foot by Apostolic authority, the inquiry (<em>processus</em>) with regard to the fame of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in general. This permission is granted by <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a>, and such remissorial letters are prepared and sent to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by the postulator-general. In case the eye-witnesses be of advanced age, other remissorial letters are usually granted for the purpose of opening a process known as "inchoative" concerning the particular <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in question. This is done in order that the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> may not be lost (<em>ne pereant probationes</em>), and such inchoative process precedes that upon the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in general. <li>While the Apostolic process concerning the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> is under way outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, documents are being prepared by the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the cause for the discussion <em>de non cultu</em>, or absence of cultus, and at the appointed time an ordinary meeting (<em>congregatio</em>) is held in which the matter is investigated; if it be found that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> has been complied with, another <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> provides that further steps may be taken. <li>When the inquiry concerning the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> (<em>super fam&acirc;</em>) has arrived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it is opened (as already described in speaking of the ordinary processes, and with the same formalities in regard to <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a>), then translated into Italian, summarized, and declared valid. The documents <em>super fam&acirc;</em> in general are prepared by the advocate, and at the proper <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, in an ordinary meeting of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Congregation</a> of Rites, the question is discussed: whether there is evidence of a general repute for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of this servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If the answer is favourable, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> embodying this result is published. <li>New remissorial letters are then sent to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em> for Apostolical processes with regard to the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in particular. These processes must be finished within eighteen months and when they are received in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> are opened, as above described, and by virtue of an equal number of <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a>, by the cardinal prefect, translated into Italian, and their summary authenticated by the Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Congregation</a> of Rites. <li>The advocate of the cause next prepares the documents (<em>positio</em>) which have reference to the discussion of the validity of all the preceding processes, informative and Apostolic. <li>This discussion is held in the meeting called <em>congregatio rotalis</em> from the fact that it is only judges of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> who vote. If the difficulties of the <a href="../cathen/12454a.htm">promotor of the Faith</a> are satisfactorily answered, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> establishing the validity of the inquiries or processes is published. <li>Meanwhile all <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> preparation is made for the discussion of the question (<em>dubium</em>): Is there evidence that the venerable servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> practiced <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> both <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/03343a.htm">cardinal</a>, and in an <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic degree</a>? (<em>An constet de virtutibus Ven. servi Dei, tam theologicis quam cardinalibus, in heroico gradu?</em>) In the causes of <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessors</a> this step is of primary importance. The point is discussed in three meetings or congregations called respectively, ante-preparatory, preparatory, and general. The first of these meetings is held in the palace of the cardinal relator (<em>reporter</em>) of the cause, and in it only consultors of the Congregation of Sacred Rites, and with their chairman, or prefect, presiding, the third is also held in the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a>, and at it the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> presides, and both <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and consultors vote. For each of these congregations the advocate of the cause prepares and prints official reports (<em>positiones</em>), called respectively <em>report</em>, <em>new report</em>, <em>final report</em>, concerning the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, etc., &#151; <em>positio, positio nova, positio novissima, super virtutibus</em>. In each case, before proceeding to the subsequent meeting, a majority of the consultors must decide that the difficulties of the <a href="../cathen/12454a.htm">promotor of the Faith</a> have been satisfactorily solved. <li>When the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Congregation</a> of Rites in the above described general meeting has decided favourably, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is asked is asked to sign the solemn <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which asserts that there exists evidence of the <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtues</a> of the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> is not published until after the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, having commended the matter to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, gives a final <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> and confirms by his supreme <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> the decision of the congregation. <li>The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> now remain to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, of which two of the first class are required in case the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic degree</a> has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, in both ordinary and Apostolic inquiries or processes by eyewitnesses &#151; three, if the eyewitnesses were found only in the ordinary processes; four, if the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proven</a> only by hearsay (<em>de auditu</em>) <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> have been sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proven</a> in the Apostolic processes (<em>super virtutibus</em>) already declared valid, steps are taken at once to prepare the documents with regard to <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> (<em>super miraculis</em>). If in the Apostolic processes only general mention has been made of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, new Apostolic processes must be opened, and conducted after the manner already described for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in an <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic degree</a>. <li>The discussion of the particular <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> proceeds in exactly the same way and in the same order as that of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. If the decisions be favourable, the general meeting of the congregation is followed by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in which it is announced that there is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. It must be noted here that in the <em>positio</em> for the ante-preparatory congregation there are required, and are printed, opinions of two physicians, one of whom has been chosen by the postulator, the other by the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Congregation</a> of Rites. Of the three reports (<em>positiones</em>) above mentioned, and which are now also required, the first is prepared in the usual way; the second consists of an exposition of the <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtues</a> of the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, an information, and a reply to later observations of the <a href="../cathen/12454a.htm">promotor of the Faith</a>; the last consists only of an answer to his final observations. <li>When the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> have been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, another meeting of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Congregation</a> of Rites is held in which it is debated once, and only once, whether or not, given the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, it is safe to proceed with the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnities</a> of beatification. If a majority of the consultors be favourable, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to this effect is issued by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> appointed by him the solemn beatification of the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> takes place in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a>, on which occasion a pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> is issued permitting the public cultus and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> of the beatified <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> now known as <a href="../cathen/02597b.htm">Blessed</a> (<em>Beatus</em>). </ol>
<h3>The beatification of martyrs</h3>

<ol><li>The causes of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are conducted in the same way as those of <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessors</a> as far as the informative processes and those <em>de non cultu</em> and <em>ad introductionem causae</em> are concerned. But when once the commission of introduction has been appointed they advance much more rapidly. <li>No remissorial letters are granted for Apostolic processes concerning the general <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; the letters sent call for an immediate investigation into the fact of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, its motive, and the particular <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> alleged. There is no longer a discussion of the general <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> or <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are not discussed, as formerly, in separate meetings, but in the same meetings that deal with the fact and the motive of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> (<em>signa</em>) required are not those of the first class; those of the second class suffice, nor is their number determined. On some occasions the decision as to <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> has been entirely dispensed with. <li>The discussion as to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, formerly held in three meetings or congregations, viz. the ante-preparatory, preparatory, and general, is now usually conducted, through a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to be had in each instance from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>, in a single congregation known as <em>particularis</em>, or special. It consists of six or seven <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Congregation</a> of Rites and four or five <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> especially deputed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. There is but one <em>positio</em> prepared in the usual way; if there be an affirmative majority a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> is issued concerning the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, the cause of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. (<em>Constare de Martyrio, caus&acirc; Martyrii et signis</em>.) <li>The final stage is a discussion of the security (<em>super tuto</em>) with which advance to beatification may be made, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessors</a>; the solemn beatification then follows.</ol>

<p>This procedure is followed in all cases of formal beatification in causes of both <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessors</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> proposed in the ordinary way (<em>per viam non cultus</em>). Those proposed as coming under the definition of cases excepted (<em>casus excepti</em>) by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> are treated in another way. In such cases it must be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that an immemorial public veneration (at least for 100 years before the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, in 1640, of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>) has been paid the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessor</a> or <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. Such cause is proposed under the title of "confirmation of veneration" (<em>de confirmatione cultus</em>); it is dealt with in an ordinary meeting of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Congregation</a> of Rites. When the difficulties of the <a href="../cathen/12454a.htm">promotor of the Faith</a> have been satisfied, a pontifical <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> confirming the cultus is <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. Beatification of this kind is called equivalent or virtual.
<h3>The canonization of confessors or martyrs</h3>

<p>The canonization of confessors or <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> may be taken up as soon as two <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are reported to have been worked at their intercession, after the pontifical permission of public veneration as described above. At this stage it is only required that the two <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> worked after the permission awarding a public cultus be discussed in three meetings of the congregation. The discussion proceeds in the ordinary way; if the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> be confirmed another meeting (<em>super tuto</em>) is held. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then issues a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Canonization in which he not only permits, but commands, the public cultus, or veneration, of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>.

<p>It is with the utmost possible brevity that I have described the elements of a process of beatification or canonization. It may be easily conjectured that considerable time must elapse before any cause of beatification or canonization can be conducted, from the first steps of the information, inquiry, or process, to the issuing of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <em>super tuto</em>. According to the constitution of this Congregation, more than one important discussion (<em>dubia majora</em>) cannot be proposed at the same time. It must be remembered <ul><li>that the same <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and consultors must vote in all discussions; <li>that there is but one <a href="../cathen/12454a.htm">promotor of the Faith</a> and one sub-promotor, who alone have charge of all observations to be made with regard to the dubia; <li>that these <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and consultors have to treat questions of ritual as well as processes of canonization and beatification.</ul> To execute all this business there is but one weekly meeting (<em>congressus</em>), a kind of minor congregation in which only the cardinal prefect and the major officials vote; in it less important and practical questions are settled regarding rites as well as causes, and answers are given, and <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> afterwards verbally approves. The other meetings of the congregation (ordinary, rotal, and "upon virtues and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>") may be as few as sixteen in the course of the year. Some other cause must therefore be found for the slow progress of causes of beatification or canonization than a lack of good will or activity on the part of the Congregation of Rites.
<h2>Expenses</h2>

<p>It will not be out of place to give succinctly the ordinary actual expenses of canonization and beatification. Of these expenses some are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> others merely discretionary, e.g. the expenses incurred in obtaining the different <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a>) others, though <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, are not specified. Such are the expenses of the solemnity in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a>, and for <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> representing the newly beatified which are afterwards presented to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, officials, and consultors of the Congregation of Rites. The limits of this class of expenses depend on the postulator of the cause. If he chooses to spend a moderate sum the entire cause from the first process to the solemn beatification will not cost him less than $20,000. The expenses of the process from beatification to canonization will easily exceed $30,000.
