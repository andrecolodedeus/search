<h1>Beauvais</h1>  

<p>(Bellovacum)

<p>A suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">archiepiscopal See of Reims</a>. The Dioceses of Beauvais, Noyon, and Senlis having been suppressed by the Concordat of 1802 for the benefit of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, a see was re-established at Beauvais in 1822, having within its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> the former Diocese of Beauvais and a large portion of the ancient Dioceses of Noyon and Senlis. A pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 1851 authorizes the incumbents of the See of Beauvais to call themselves Bishops of Beauvais, Noyon, and Senlis.
<h2>Diocese of Beauvais</h2>

<p>Tradition looks upon St. Lucianus, sent to Beauvais by Pope Fabianus and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>, about 275, with his companions Maxianus and Julianus, as the founder of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in that place. The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Romana under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, of St. Just during the atrocious <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> by the legendary Rictiovarus (about 419), of St. Maxentia, daughter of the King of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, who, about 450, preferred to die rather than follow her fiance, render the primitive Church of Beauvais illustrious. The exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> is obscure, but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who occupied it from 632 to 660 was the thirteenth incumbent. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Beauvais counts Odo (860-881), charged by <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> in 867 to answer with <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> the grievances of Photius; Gui (1063-85), who founded St. Quentin of Beauvais, the great <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; Pierre Cauchon (1420-32), identified with the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>; Jean Juvenal des Ursins (1433-44), author of the Chronicle of Charles VI; Cardinal Odet de Chatillon (1535-62), nephew of Coligny, who turned <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>; Francois-Joseph de la Rochefoucauld (1772-92), <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in 1792; and Feutrier (1825-30), minister of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs in the Martignac cabinet.
<h2>Diocese of Senlis</h2>

<p>The Church founded at Senlis by St. Rieul (Regulus) about 300, had its ninth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Levangius, in 511. Saints Sanctinus, Agmarus, and Autbertus were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the sixth and seventh centuries.
<h2>Diocese of Noyon</h2>

<p>The headquarters of the city of the Veromandui, who undoubtedly had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from the beginning of the fourth century, having been destroyed by the barbarians, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were without a residence until St. M&eacute;dard (530-545), fourteenth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, installed himself at Noyon. This city counted among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the goldsmith St. Eloi (Eligius, 640-659), Dagobert's prime minister; St. Mummolenus (second half of seventh century), and St. Eunutius (eighth century). The <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">See of Tournai</a> was cut off from Noyon in 1146.

<p>These sees played an important part in the history of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a>, and at the beginning of the Capetian, period. A council convoked at Beauvais by Charles the Bald, in 845, elected <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>. At Compiegne where, next to his hunting-lodge, Charles the Bald had built the great Abbey of Notre Dame, placing therein the bodies of Sts. Cornelius and Cyprian, and where Kings Louis the Stammerer and Eudes were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> and buried, there were held, in the course of the ninth century, numerous councils which regulated the political and religious questions of the time. A council at Compiegne in 1092 forced the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/13189c.htm">Roscelin</a> to retire, and one at Senlis in 1310, condemned nine <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>. Being Count of Beauvais from 1013, and Peer of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from the twelfth century, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Beauvais wore the royal mantle at the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of the Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; it was he, who, with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, was wont to raise the king from his throne to present him to his people. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Noyon was both duke and peer. The monastic life was established in this region by St. Evrost in the sixth, and St. Germer in the seventh, century.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Cathedrals of Beauvais and Senlis are inferior in point of interest to that of Noyon, which is one of the most beautiful monuments of the twelfth century. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, on each recurring 14th of January, the <a href="../cathen/01798b.htm">Feast of Asses</a> was celebrated in the Beauvais Cathedral, in commemoration of the flight of the Virgin into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and every year, on 27 June, there is a religious procession through the streets of Beauvais to perpetuate Jeanne Hachette's opposition to Charles the Bold in 1472. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">John Calvin</a> was a native of Noyon, and Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly was born in Compiegne. The places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: Notre Dame de Bon Secours at Compiegne, a shrine erected in 1637 as an expression of gratitude for the raising of the siege of the city by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>; Notre Dame de Bon Secours at Gannes; Notre Dame de Bon Secours at Feuquieres; Notre Dame du Hamel at L'Hamel Notre-Dame; Notre Dame de Bon Secours at Montmelian; Notre Dame de Senlis at Senlis; Notre Dame des Fleurs at Ville-en-Braye.

<p>In 1899 the following institutions were found in the diocese: 6 <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylums</a>, 44 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 14 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 1 free industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, 2 <em>patronages</em>, 2 charity kitchens, 9 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and hospices, 1 house of retreat, 12 homes for the aged, 9 communities devoted to care for the sick in their homes, all conducted by <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; and 2 <em>patronages</em> under the care of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>. In 1900 there were the following <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders for men: <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a> at Senlis, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> as Thury in Valois, and <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a> at Beauvais. Among the orders for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> there were no congregations belonging exclusively to the diocese. At the close of 1905 the Diocese of Beauvais had 407,808 inhabitants, 39 pastorates, 501 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (mission churches), and 10 curacies.
