<h1>Beda Weber</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> professor, author, and member of the National German Parliament, born at Lienz in the Tyrol, 26 October, 1798; died at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a>, 28 February, 1859. His father wished him to learn a trade as well as the ordinary work of a peasant, and thus Weber became a shoemaker. He was very talented, and completed the high-school course at Bozen in four years, and studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at Insbruck during two years. He then entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Marienberg in Obervintschgau, changing his <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">Christian name</a>, Johann Chrysanth, to Beda. In the autumn of 1821 he began to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">University of Innsbruck</a>, and on the abolition of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty there, he continued his course at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1824, and went for a short time to the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> to prepare himself for pastoral work; in 1825 he returned to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Afte a short time spent in the pastorate he began to teach at the high-school at Meran, where he remained for twenty years. He received calls to professorships from the <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">University of Innsbruck</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> lyceum at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and from the Crown-Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, but remained at Meran until he was called away by the political events of 1848. He was elected deputy to the national Parliament held at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>. His parliamentary labours attracted attention. When the town <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> died, Weber succeeded him. His activity and great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> was recognized by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who made him canon of <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a>, episcopal commissary, spiritual councillor, and member of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> court at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> commission, as well as inspector of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. His labours <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> too great for his frail constitution and he was soon carried off by apoplexy. Weber's memory has been perpetuated by a fresco in the imperial <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the restoration of which he began.

<p>His chief works are: several poems for a poetical annual, the "Alpenblumen", a translation of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom's</a> "On the Priesthood" (1833); studies upon Oswald's treatise of Wolkenstein, which led to the discovery of a valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> containing "Titurel" and the "Nibelungenlied", "Das Land Tirol" (1837-8); "Meran und seine Umgebung" (1845); "Die Stadt Bozen und ihre Umgebung" (1849); "Das Tal Passeier und seine Bewohner" (1851), containing an account of Andreas Hofer and the events of 1809; "Erhuldihistorischen Bildern und Fragmenten" (1841); "Lieder aus Tirol" (1842), a selection of his poems; "Bl&uuml;ten heiliger Liebe und Andacht. Aus den Schriften der Giovanna Maria vom Kreuze"; "Giovanna della Croce und ihre Zeit"; "Die Gedichte Oswalds von Wolkenstein" (1847); "Oswald von Wolkenstein und Friedrich mit der leeren Tasche" (1850). Weber was an excellent preacher, and published "Predigten and Tiroler Volk", the proceeds of which he gave to charity. He founded a weekly paper, "Das Frankfurter katholische Kirchenblat" (1853), which two years later became the Sunday supplement of a large <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper, the "Deutschland". He issued a selection of his contributions to this paper under the title of "Cartons aus dem deutschen Kirchenleben" (1858); five years earlier he had collected his contributions to the "Augsburger Postzeitung" and to the "Historisch-politische Bl&auml;tter" in book form under the title "Charakterbilder".
