<h1>Bede</h1>  

<p>(Or B<font size=-2>EAD</font>, whence Bedehouse, Bedesman, Bederoll).

<p>The old English word <em>bede</em> (Anglo-Saxon <em>bed</em>) means a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, though the derivative form, <em>gebed</em>, was more common in this sense in Anglo-Saxon literature. When, in the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the use of little perforated globes of bone, wood, or amber, threaded upon a string, came into fashion for the purpose of counting the repetitions of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a> or Hail Mary, these objects themselves became known as <em>bedes</em> (i.e. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>), and our modern word <em><a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">bead</a></em>, as applied to small globular ornaments of glass, coral, etc., has no other derivation. In middle English the word <em>bedes</em> was used both in the sense of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a> could still write (Rich. III, iii, 7)

<blockquote><p>When <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and devout religious <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <br>Are at their beads [<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>], 'tis much to draw them thence, <br>So sweet is <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> contemplation. </p></blockquote>

<p>While of <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucer's</a> Prioress we are told

<blockquote><p>Of smal coral aboute hire arm she bar <br>A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene. </p></blockquote>

<p>The gauds, or gaudys, were the ornaments or larger beads used to divide the decades. The phrase <em>pair of beads</em> (i.e. set of beads &mdash; cf. pair of stairs), which may still be heard on the lips of old-fashioned English and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, is consequently of venerable antiquity. With such speakers a pair of beads means the round of the beads, i.e. the chaplet of five decades, as opposed to the whole <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a> of fifteen. Again, to "bid beads" originally meant only to say <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but the phrase "bidding the <a href="../cathen/02361c.htm">beads</a>", by a series of misconceptions explained in the "Historical English Dictionary", came to be attached to certain public devotions analogous to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which precede the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> of the Cross in the <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> Service. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> referred to used to be recited in the vernacular at the Sunday Mass in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and the distinctive feature of them was that the subject of each was announced in a formula read to the congregation beforehand. This was called "bidding the bedes". From this the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was derived that the word "bidding" meant commanding or giving out, and hence a certain survival of these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, still retained in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> "Book of Canons", and recited before the sermon, is known as the "bidding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>".

<p>The words <em>bedesman</em> and <em>bedeswoman</em>, which date back to Anglo-Saxon times, also recall the original meaning of the word. <em>Bedesman</em> was at first the term applied to one whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for others, and thus it sometimes denoted the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of a guild. But in later English a bedesman is simply the recipient of any form of bounty; for example, a poor man who obtains free quarters in an almshouse, and who is supposed to be bound in gratitude to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for his benefactors. Similarly, <em>bedehouse</em>, which originally meant a place of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or an oratory, came at a later date to be used of any charitable institution like an almshouse. It has now practically disappeared from literary English, but survives provincially and in a number of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> place-names in the form <em>bettws</em>, e.g. Bettws y Coed. Finally, <em>bede-roll</em>, as its etymology suggests, meant the roll of those to be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for, and in some sense corresponded to the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> of the early Church. The word is of tolerably frequent occurrence in connection with the early English guilds. In these associations a list was invariably kept of departed members who had a claim on their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. This was the bede-roll.
