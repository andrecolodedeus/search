<h1>Beirut</h1>  

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, a titular <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and the residential see of several <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of Oriental rites. The earliest form was likely <em>Beeroth</em> "springs", not Beroth (<a href="../bible/2sa008.htm#vrs8">2 Samuel 8:8</a>) or Berotha (<a href="../bible/eze047.htm#vrs16">Ezekiel 47:16</a>), probably situated near <a href="../cathen/02177a.htm">Baalbek</a> in Coele-Syria. It difficult to explain the more usual form, <em>Berytos</em>, but it probably comes from <em>Ber&ucirc;ti</em>, the <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> name of a fish-goddess related to the god of Gebal or Byblos, two towns of the Giblites, a <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> tribe. Berytos was the birthplace of Sanchoniathon, an early <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> author, and seems to have been unimportant in remote times. It is mentioned by the Greeks before Alexander, but is not spoken of in connection with the expeditions of this conqueror. After the time of Antiochus IV, Epiphanes (175-164 B.C.), Berytos was known as Laodicea of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, a name which it kept until the reign of <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>, Zabinas (129-123 B.C.); see J. Rouvier, in "Revue de numismatique" (1896), and "Revue biblique", VII, 272-275. According to Strabo (XVI, ii, 9) it was destroyed by King Tryphon (137-134 B.C.). If this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it must have been rebuilt after a short time, for there are records for the complete series of the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of Berytos from 123 to 14 B.C. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the Romans enlarged and embellished it; that it was garrisoned by two legions, the Leg. V Macedonica and Leg. VIII Augusta, and that in the year 14 B.C. it became a Roman colony with the name <em>Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Berytus</em>, so called after Julia, the daughter of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> (Mommsen, Res gestae divi Augusti, II, 119). The Jewish kings <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#I">Herod the Great</a>, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Herod Agrippa I</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#V">Herod Agrippa II</a> built sumptuous monuments at Berytos and gave gladiatorial combats there (Josephus, Bell. Jud., I, xxi, 11; Antiq., XVI, xi, 2; XVII, x, 9; XIX, vii, 5; XX, ix, 4); Titus also, after the siege of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, gave gladiatorial games at Berytos, in which the combatants were <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. (Josephus, Bell. Jud., VII, iii, 1.) From that time dates the magnificent aqueduct, the remains of which are yet visible, which carried to the city the waters of the River Magoras, now Nahr Beiruth. About the middle of the third century Berytos became the seat of the most renowned law <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the Eastern Roman Empire. Many celebrated jurisconsults were among its teachers (Montreuil, Hist. du droit byzantin, I, 264-273, 279-283). This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was spared by Justinian when he closed all similar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in favour of Constantinople. The town had suffered much from an earthquake in 529, and when taken by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> about 635 it had fallen into decay.

<p>Berytos became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Christian see</a> at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, and was a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> Prima, a province of the Patriarchate of Antioch. In antiquity its most famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, the courtier-prelate and strong supporter of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> in the fourth century. <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a> (II, 815-820) gives a list of thirteen Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> reaching to 1673, rectified and completed by Cyril Charon, a Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (in Al-Mashriq, Beirut, 1 March, 1905). In 450 Beirut obtained from Theodosius II the title of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over six sees taken from <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>; but in 451 the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> restored these to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, leaving, however, to Beirut its rank of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VII, 85-98). Thus, from 451 Beirut was an exempt <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> depending directly on the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. The city was captured on 27 April, 1111, by Baldwin I, King of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and with the exception of short intervals was held by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> till 1241. At an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> they established there a <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and, with the provinces of Arabia and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> Prima, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> comprised in the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Lists of its <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are available (<a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a>, III, 1325-27; <a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a>, 434; Eubel, I, 137; II, 117; Revue benedictine, 1904, 133-34).

<p>Owing to the fertility of the soil and the security of the harbour, Beirut soon became one of the most active commercial cities in the East. The Druse Ameer Fakhr ed-Din (1595-1634) improved the city and made it better known in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He was a ruler of genius, and succeeded in creating a principality all but independent of the Porte. Beirut was his residence, and the environs his gardens. He planted near the city the beautiful pine wood which is still its finest walk. He had relations with the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> and with the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>; in 1633 he embraced <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and in the following year suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The fact is undeniable, for the letters of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> who was the means of his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> have just been published (de Barenton, O. M. C., "La France catholique en Orient", 158-164). In the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Government succeeded in reducing the power of several native <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> that had forced themselves upon Beirut; at the present time <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> authority is supreme. The city was shelled in 1840 by the English and in 1860 occupied by the French after the frightful slaughter of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>; since that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> it has been steadily thriving. Ships of the heaviest tonnage visit its harbour; railroads connect it with Damascus by way of <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Lebanon</a>, and with Tripoli; carriage-roads connect it with the inland and seaboard towns. The country is well watered and cultivated, and the view from the city is beautiful. Beirut is the capital of a homonymous vilayet. The population, which is about 150,000, shows a steady increase. There are 40,000 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, besides the small garrison; 40,000 <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, 35,000 Greeks, 12,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> Greeks, 2,000 Latins, 2,000 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 2,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Druses, and Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, 2,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Syrians and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>.

<p>Apart from its interest as a Latin titular <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, it may be noted that Beirut is: (1) a Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> with about 70,000 believers and many elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; in the city of Beirut are 5 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls conducted by 23 teachers in the pay of the Russian Government; (2) a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Greeks or <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>, who number about 15,000 and have a large college at Beirut; (3) a <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> see, with 50,000 subjects; 50 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 30 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and college located in the city; (4) a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> see, with about 1,000 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, the residence of the Syrian patriarch having been transferred from <a href="../cathen/09650e.htm">Mardin</a> to Beirut. The Latin Vicar-Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, who is also the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> for Oriental rites, has been stationed since 1890 at Beirut (previously at <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>), with about 6,000 under his spiritual rule.

<p>In Beirut are many <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> and Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Baladites, Aleppines, and <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">Salvatorians</a>, who unaided would be unable to compete with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> propaganda which has taken Beirut as a centre, whence it spreads over the whole of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Since 1866 the German mission has had charge of the Hospital of the Knights of St. John, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls conducted by <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>. The Jewish mission of the <a href="../cathen/13627a.htm">Church of Scotland</a> since 1864 has conducted two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and girls. Miss Taylor's "St. George's Institute" has charge of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> or Druse girls. Since 1860 the British Syrian Mission has had a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, 10 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and a normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Since 1825 the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> Church of New York has maintained at Beirut a church, a printing-house, its Bible agency, and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls. At a later period it built there the American <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which includes an intermediate college, a medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the training of native preachers and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>. It also publishes a newspaper and a review; and maintains outside of Beirut 130 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 109 teachers and 8,000 pupils. In spite of so much effort and expense the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missions have gained in the last 80 years only about 5,000 adherents in all <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opposition to their propaganda is supported chiefly by French missionaries. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> each have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>; the Sisters of Charity, <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a boarding-school, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, and an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> girls; they also have charge of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at the Catholic University. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> and the Dames de Nazareth have a boarding-school; the Sisters of the Holy Family, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; the Mariamets, native <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, their principal house. The most imposing institutions are those of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. They maintain and direct outside of Beirut 192 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and girls, with 294 teachers and 12,000 pupils. There is in the city a faculty of medicine (120 students) founded in 1881 with the help of the French Government; its examinations are conducted before French and Ottoman physicians, and its diplomas are recognized by both <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Turkey. They conduct, moreover, St. Joseph's Catholic University, the title of which was granted by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 25 February, 1881. This <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> includes: (1) a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (60 students) for natives of all rites, which up to 1902 had sent out 228 students, including 3 <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, 15 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 115 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 83 <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>; (2) a faculty of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> (30 students), which grants the same degrees as the Gregorian University in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; (3) a faculty of Oriental languages and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, founded in 1902, which teaches the literary and conversational use of Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, Coptic, and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a>; the comparative grammar of <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> languages, the history and geography of the Orient; Oriental archaeology; Graeco-Roman epigraphy and antiquities; (4) a classical and modern tuition college (400 pupils); (5) 3 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (600 pupils). A printing-house, inaugurated in 1853, is now famous as the foremost Arabic printing-house. Since 1871 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> have published "Al-Bashir", a weekly Arabic newspaper, and since 1898 a fortnightly Arabic review, "Al-Mashriq", the editors of which took rank at once among the best <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalists</a>. In 1906 they began a collection of philological papers, "Melanges de la Facult&eacute; orientale de l'Universit&eacute; Saint-Joseph". Finally, they contribute to many scientific periodicals and publish, chiefly in Arabic, works of great value. We may mention here another precious collect: "Documents in&eacute;dits pur servir &agrave; l'histoire du christianisme en Orient", the first volume of which appeared at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1905. These missionaries are the strongest bulwark of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.
