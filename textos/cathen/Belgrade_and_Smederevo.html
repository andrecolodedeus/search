<h1>Belgrade and Smederevo</h1>  

<p>Titular (united) sees of <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>. The history of these sees is as confused as their present plight is pitiful from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> stand-point. <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> claim St. Titus, the disciple of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, as their first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionary; but the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Belgrade, Theodosius, dates only from 1059. As the ancient Singidunum, however, it was an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> in the fourth century, but gradually declined during the invasions of the barbarian <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> see was founded by the King of Croatia. The Hungarians and the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> disputed the possession of Belgrade (Serb <em>Beograd</em>, white city). The latter having destroyed the town (1126), the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was transferred to the neighbouring Scardona, so extensively embellished by them that it received the name of Scardona Nova. Religion had long flourished there, for one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the Council of <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Salona</a> (530) signs as <em>Episcopus Ecclesiae Scardinitanae</em>. On the occasion of the transfer to Scardona the title of Belgrade disappears for centuries from <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. The neighbouring city of Smederevo (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Smendria</em>) was also an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. <a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a> gives the names of four of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from 1544 to 1605, a list, beginning 1334, of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom he styles "of Belgrade and Semendria" (<em>Nadoralbenses et Belgradenses</em>). It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that in 1650 <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> re-established the title and See of Belgrade; for a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> (4 December, 1651) is extant addressed to Matthew Benlich, <em>Episcopus Bellegradensis, Ecclesiae Samadiensis Administrator</em>, creating him <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> for those sees of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> which were under <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> domination.

<p>In 1729 the two Dioceses of Belgrade and Smederevo were united by <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, and in 1733 Vincent Bagradin became the first holder of the double title. Thenceforward the list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is regular and complete. The "Notizie di Roma" (the official annual of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>) gives the names of all the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of this see. Until recent years Belgrade and Smederevo were considered residential sees; it is expressly so stated in the consistory of 1858. It was added that these two sees (ancient Alba Graeca and Singidunum respectively) were suffragans of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of <a href="../cathen/01582b.htm">Antivari</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to them resided in the Emperor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, "but as they are held by the infidels, their actual state is passed over in silence". For many years the title was given to the auxiliary of an Hungarian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (at present to the auxiliary of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Zagrab</a>) who was bound to reside with his superior. The "Gerarchia" for 1906, without giving any notice of the change, has transferred this see to the list of titular <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, though Bishop Krapac, who now holds the title, was named in 1904 as a residential <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>The present condition of this Church is most lamentable. The limits of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are those of the Kingdom of Servia, which has an area of 18,630 square miles and a population (1905) of 2,6786,989, belonging for the most part to the <a href="../cathen/13535a.htm">Greek schism</a>, which is the official religion of the State. Since 1851 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Diokovar acts as administrator Apostolic; since 1886 the territory is united to the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a> (Kirch. Handlex., I, 533). There are only two or three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who divide their activities between the three principal stations of Belgrade (4,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>), Kragujevatz (200), and Nish (2,000). There are also seven secondary stations, numbering about 1,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> all told. (It is to be noted that according to the "Statesman's Year Book" for 1907, the Servian census of 1900 gives 10,243 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.) One church, two <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and two elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (at Belgrade and Nish respectively) complete the list of the mission's resources.

<p>The statistics say nothing of <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Greeks, which leads us to suppose that these Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are only western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> whose business <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliges</a> them to reside in <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>. Belgrade has (1905) a population of 80,747. Situated on the right bank of the Danube, just below the Save, it has always been a natural fortress, and as such is famous in military history. From 1522 to 1867 it passed alternately from <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> to Austrians; in the latter year the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> garrison was withdrawn, and in 1878, by the Treaty of Berlin, Belgrade became the capital of the new <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Christian Kingdom of Servia</a>.
