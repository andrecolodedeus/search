<h1>Belley</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Belley (Bellicium)

<p>Coextensive with the civil department of Ain and a suffragan of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>. Although suppressed at the time of the Concordat, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Belley was re-established in 1822 and took from the <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Archdiocese of Lyons</a> the arrondissements of Belley, Bourg, Nantua, and Tr&eacute;voux, and from the <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Archdiocese of Chamb&eacute;ry</a> the arrondissement of Gex.

<p>Local tradition maintains that Belley was evangelized in the second century by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Marcellus and Valerian, companions of St. Pothinus. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of historic <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is Vincentius, mentioned in 552. Others who occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were St. Hippolytus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Condat (eighth century); St. Anthelm (1163-78), seventh General of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian Order</a>; St. Arthaud (1179-90), founder of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> at Arvi&egrave;res; Camus (1609-29), a noted preacher and romancist; and Monseigneur Fran&ccedil;ois M. Richard (1872-75), later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Belley honours in a special manner <a href="../cathen/01380b.htm">St. Amandus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maastricht, who founded the Abbey of Nantua about 660; St. Vulbas, a patrician of Bourgogne and a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> companion of King Dagobert, treacherously assassinated in 642; St. Rambert, killed by order of Ebroin in the seventh century, whose name has been given to a city of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; St. Trivier, the solitary, who died about 650; St. Barnard (ninth century), who founded the great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Ambronay and died <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a> (twelfth century), founder of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey at Chezery; St. Roland (twelfth century), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Chezery; St. Stephen of Chatillon, who founded the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Portes, in 1115, and died <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Die; St. Stephen of Bourg, who founded the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Meyria in 1116; and <a href="../cathen/08326c.htm">Bl. Jean-Baptiste Vianney</a> (1786-1859), <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Ars.

<p>The Diocese of Belley which, in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, had no less than eight <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, was the birthplace of the Jos&eacute;phistes, a congregation founded by Jacques Cr&eacute;tenet (1606-67), a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> and surgeon who became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> after the death of his wife; of the teaching order of the Sisters of St. Charles, founded by Charles Demia of Bourg (1636-89); and of three teaching orders founded in the first half of the nineteenth century: the Brothers of the Society of the Cross of Jesus; the Brothers of the Holy Family of Belley, and the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Bourg. In 1858 a <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was established in the unhealthy Dombes district. Cardinal Louis Aleman (1390-1450) and Soeur Rosalie (1787-1856), noted in the history of modern <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> charities, were both native of the Diocese of Belley. Blessed Pierre-Louis-Marie Chanel was born at Cuet near Bourg. For thirty years of its existence (1701-31), "Le Journal de Tr&eacute;voux", a valuable repertory of the literary and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a> of the period, was published by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Tr&eacute;voux, in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The church at Brou, near Bourg, is a marvel of architecture and contains some wonderful pieces of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>. It was built between 1511 and 1536 under the direction of Margaret of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Philibert (II) the Fair, Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>.

<p>The latest statistics for the diocese have the following institutions: 1 maternity <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, 66 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 deaf-mute institute, 3 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 10 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 21 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, or hospices, 2 dispensaries, 21 communities for the care of the sick in their homes, 1 home for incurables, and 5 homes for the aged, all conducted by sisters; and 1 deaf-mute institute, and 2 <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">insane asylums</a> conducted by brothers.

<p>In 1900 the following <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were represented in the Diocese of Belley: <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, at Portes and S&eacute;lignac; <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> at Notre Dame des Dombes; <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a> at Belley; <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> at Musiniens; and Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> at Tr&eacute;voux. Congregations local to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: two teaching orders; the Brothers of the Society of the Cross of Jesus founded by M. Bochard in 1824, and the Brothers of the Holy Family, founded by Brother Taborin in 1835; and the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, with mother-house at Bourg, very numerous throughout the department. At the close of the year 1905 the Diocese of Belley contained 350,416 inhabitants, 36 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 404 mission churches, and 75 curacies.
