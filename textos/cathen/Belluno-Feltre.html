<h1>Belluno-Feltre</h1>  

<p>(Diocese of Belluno-Feltre).

<p>Belluno, which was anciently called Bellunum, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the province of that name in Venetia, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, is situated on a hill between the torrent of Ardo and the River Piave, and has a population of 10,000. At the end of the tenth century Belluno was affected by the political disturbances then agitating the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> provinces. Bishop Joannes II (959) obtained from <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> for himself and his successors the title of count and temporal sovereignty over this city and the surrounding territory. He also fortified the city. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> there were many disputes over the civil mastery of Belluno, but in 1420 the inhabitants of their own accord acknowledged the authority of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Belluno is the seat of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> suffragan to the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and is united with the See of Feltre. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is said to have been first preached there by St. Hermagoras, a disciple of St. Mark and first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, and next by Prosdocimus, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>. <a href="../cathen/15119b.htm">Ughelli</a> places the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Theodorus, in the reign of <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Emperor Commodus</a> and the second, St. Salvator, as succeeding under <a href="../cathen/11732a.htm">Pertinax</a>. About 300 another Theodorus is thought to have brought from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> the remains of St. Giovata, patron of the city. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> known to history is a certain Laurentius, who, in 587, attended the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> assembly convened by Severus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, in connection with the dispute of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>. The twelfth century was a stormy period for Belluno, in both civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> respects. In 1197 Bishop Gerardo de Taccoli was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/15038a.htm">Treviso</a>, after which <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> united the Diocese of Belluno with that of Feltre.

<p>Feltre, the ancient Feltria, is situated in the province of Belluno in Venetia, on the River Colmeda, and contains 13,000 inhabitants. From the year 80 B.C. it enjoyed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Roman citizenship. It was besieged during the invasion of <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a>. <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a> created the Bishops of Feltre counts of the city and vicinity, but their authority was almost constantly assailed by the Counts of Camino, by Ezzelino da Romano, the Scaligeri, the Carrara, and finally by the Visconti themselves. At last, in 1404, the city fell into the power of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>. Feltre also claims to have received the Gospel from St. Prosdocimus. St. Victor, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, is said to have lived there about A.D. 170. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Feltre whose date can be fixed is Fonteius, who in 579 took part in a council in <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> and in 591 dedicated a book to Emperor Mauritius. Drudo of Camino (1174) was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of Belluno and Feltre, the latter being their residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries were filled with civil strife.

<p>In 1462, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Republic, the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were separated. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Belluno was Ludovico Donato. Bishops Pietro Barozzi, Mose Buffarello, and Bernardo Rossi (1499) rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. One of the most illustrious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was Luigi Lollin (1595) who did much to promote the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of learning among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and left large bequests to perpetually provide for a number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>. Giulio Berlendis (1655) completed the work of enforcing the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> reforms, and Gianfrancesco Bembo, a member of the <a href="../cathen/14140a.htm">Somaschi</a> (1695), was very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the cause of popular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In 1818 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was reunited with that of Feltre. Among the Bishops of Feltre after the separation mention should be made of Angelo Faseolo (1464), who was appointed on many legations in connection with the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>; <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Lorenzo Campeggio</a> (1512), famous as the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> during the time of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, later made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and transferred (1520) to Bologna. He was succeeded by his nephew Tommaso Campeggio, who was <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> several times. Agostino Gradenigo (1610) restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Zerbino Lugo (1640) built the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Giovanni Bortoli (1748) was a distinguished professor of canon law at Padua.

<p>The most remarkable sacred edifices in Belluno are, in addition to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the church of San Pietro, and that of San Stephano, the latter in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style; all three contain <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> artists. In Feltre there are the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to St. Laurence, the oratory of San Giacomo, the churches of San Giorgio in Villabruna, and San Rocco; in the last named the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> over the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is the work of <a href="../cathen/11430a.htm">Palma il Vecchio</a>. Outside the city, on the slopes of Mount Misnea is the church of SS. Vittore e Corona, erected by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> of Feltre after the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>.

<p>The Diocese of Belluno contains 72 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 280 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, 137 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 22 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regulars</a>, 22 seminarists, 5 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, 29 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, and a population of 127,500. Feltre has 17 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 100 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, 48 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 25 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regulars</a>, 56 seminarists, 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and 2 for girls, and a population of 48,000.
