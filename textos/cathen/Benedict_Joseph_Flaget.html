<h1>Benedict Joseph Flaget</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bardstown (subsequently of <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>), <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> b. at Contournat, near Billom, Auvergne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 7 November, 1763; d. 11 February, 1850, at <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, Kentucky. He was a posthumous child and was only two years old when his mother died, leaving him and two brothers to the care of an aunt; they were welcomed at the home of Canon Beno&#238;t Flaget, their uncle, at Billom. In his seventeenth year, he went to the Sulpician <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> to study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and joining the Society of St. Sulpice, 1 November, 1783, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1787, at Issy, where Father Gabriel Richard, the future apostle of Michigan, was then superior. Flaget taught <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> for two years, and filled the same chair at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Angers when that house was closed by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. He returned to Billom in 1791 and on the advice of the Sulpician superior, Father Emery, determined to devote himself to the American mission. He sailed in January, 1792, with Father J.B.M. David, his future coadjutor, and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Stephen Badin</a>, landing in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 29 March, 1792. He was studying English with his Sulpician brethren, when Bishop Carroll tested his self-sacrifice by sending him to Fort Vincennes, as missionary to the Indians and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the Fort. Crossing the mountains he reached Pittsburg, where he had to tarry for six months owing to low water in the Ohio, doing such good work that he gained the lasting esteem of General Anthony Wayne. The latter recommended him to the military commander Colonel Clark, at the Falls of the Ohio, who deemed it an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to escort him to Fort Vincennes, where he arrived 21 December, 1792. Father Flaget stayed here two years and then, recalled by his superiors, he became professor at the <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a> under the presidency of Father Dubourg. In November, 1798, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>, whence he returned in 1801 with twenty-three students to Baltimore.

<p>On 8 April, 1808, Bardstown, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, was created a see and Flaget was named its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He refused the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and his colleagues of St. Sulpice approved his action, but when in 1809 he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, his superior, Father Emery, received him with the greeting: "My Lord, you should be in your diocese! The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> commands you to accept." Leaving <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with Father Simon William Brut&eacute;, the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes, and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, Guy Ignatius Chabrat, his future coadjutor in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>. Flaget landed in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 4 November, 1810, by Archbishop Carroll. The Diocese of Bardstown comprised the whole North-West, bounded East and West by Louisiana and the Mississippi. Bishop Flaget, handicapped by poverty, did not leave Baltimore until 11 May, 1811, and reached Louisville, 4 June, whence the Rev. C. Nerinckx escorted him to Bardstown. He arrived there 9 June. On <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> of that year he <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the Rev. Guy Ignatius Chabrat, the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in the West. Before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1813, he had established <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> conferences, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at St. Stephen's (removed to St. Thomas', November, 1811), and made two pastoral visits in <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>. That summer he visited the outlying districts of <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and Eastern Missouri, confirming 1275 people during the trip.

<p>Bishop Flaget's great experience, absolute self-denial, and holy life gave him great influence in the councils of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Most of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appointed within the next twenty years were selected with his advice. In October, 1817, he went to St. Louis to prepare the way for Bishop Dubourg. He recommended Bishop Fenwick for <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, then left on a trip through that State, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, and Michigan in 1818. In the latter State he did great missionary work at <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> and Monroe, attending also a rally of 10,000 Indians at St. Mary's. Upon his return to Kentucky in 1819 he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in Bardstown, 8 August, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> therein his first coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Rev. J.B.M. David, on the 15th. In 1821 he started on a visitation of <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>, and bought <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in Nashville for the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church. The years 1819 to 1821 were devoted to missionary work among the Indians. He celebrated the first Synod of Bardstown, 8 August, 1823, and continued his labours until 1828, when he was called to Baltimore to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> Archbishop Whitfield; there he attended the first Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1829. In 1830 he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> one of his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Rev. Richard Kenrick</a>, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia. A great friend of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, he invited the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to take charge of St. Mary's College, Bardstown, in 1832. In the meantime he had resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in favour of Bishop David with Bishop Chabrat as coadjutor. Both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people rebelled, and their representations were so instant and continued that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> recalled its appointment and reinstated Bishop Flaget, who during all this time was, regardless of age and infirmities, attending the cholera-stricken in <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, Bardstown, and surrounding country during 1832 and 1833. Bishop Chabrat became his second coadjutor and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 20 July, 1834. Only Kentucky and <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a> were now left under Flaget's <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and in the former he founded various religious institutions, including four colleges, two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, one foundation of brothers, and two religious institutions of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a> became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with see at <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Nashville</a> in 1838.

<p>His only visit to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was not undertaken until 1835. He spent four years in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the interests of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and of the propogation of the Faith, visiting forty-six <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Everywhere he edified the people by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of his life, and well authenticated <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are ascribed to his intercession. He returned to America in 1839, transferred his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> his fruitful life by consecrating, 10 September, 1848, a young Kentucky <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Martin John Spalding, as his third coadjutor and successor in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a> was laid 15 August, 1849. He died peacefully at <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, sincerely mourned and remembered to this day. His only writings are his journal and a report of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.
