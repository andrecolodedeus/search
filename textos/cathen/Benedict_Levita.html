<h1>Benedict Levita</h1>  

<p>Benedict Levita (of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>), or Benedict the Deacon, is the name given to himself by the author of a forged collection of capitularies which appeared in the ninth century. The collection belongs to the group of pseudo-Isidorian forgeries that includes the pseudo-Isidorian recension of the Spanish collection of canons, the so-called "capitula Angilramni", and the collection of <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">false decretals</a> of the pseudo-Isidore. The name Benedict is, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, an assumed one; the statement that he had been a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and that the collection had been made from the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> archives of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> at the command of the late Archbishop Autgar (825-847) is clearly also <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>. Nothing is known concerning the real author. On internal evidence it may be accepted that these forged capitularies were composed in the western part of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> empire and not at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; the grounds for this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> are, especially, the opposition shown to the institution of "chorepiscopi", and further the circumstance that the collection was first used and found readiest acceptance among the Western <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. The close relationship between this collection and <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore</a> lends some probability to the supposition that it arose in the <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Archdiocese of Reims</a>. As to the time when it appeared there is no reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the statement of the author that Archbishop Autgar of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> was then dead. Consequently the collection was made after 847 (Autgar died 21 April, 847). This is confirmed by a metrical panegyric, prefixed to the collection, in praise of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> rulers, and in which Louis the German, the Emperor Lothair, and Charles the Bald are described as living, a fact which points to the years following 843. Another clue is offered by "Additamentum" IV in which the forged pseudo-Isidorian <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> have evidently been used. But the way in which these <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> are employed by Benedict shows that the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidorian collection</a> had not yet reached its completed form. The latest date for the appearance of this collection of canons may, therefore, be given as from 848 to 850. The time of composition cannot be more exactly determined; it was somewhere between the years 847-850.

<p>The author represents his collection as the continuation and completion of the collection of genuine capitularies in four books, "Capitularia regum Francorum", produced in 827 by Ansegisus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fontanelle. He divides it into three books which designates as "liber quintus", "sextus", and "septimus". Three other writings precede the first book; a prologue in verse, a preface in prose which treats of the origin and contents of the collection, and the aforesaid metrical panegyric on the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> line; beginning with Pepin and Carloman and ending with the sons of Louis the Pious. Four supplementary writings (additamenta) are annexed to the last book; (I) The Aachen capitulary of 817 concerning the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; (II) the report of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (August, 829) to the Emperor Louis the Pious; (III) a few genuine capitularies and a large number of forged ones, just as in the main body of the collection; (IV) a large number (170) of extracts taken from various sources, among which are also <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">forgeries of the Pseudo-Isidore</a>. The work of Abbot Ansegisus was taken as a model for the collection. As to the sources of the collection, about one-fourth of it consists of genuine capitularies (a certain kind of royal decrees customary in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire); in fact, the genuine materials used by the author surpass sometimes those used by Ansegisus. Most of the pretended capitularies are, however, not genuine. Among the genuine sources, from which the larger portion of them are drawn, are: the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; the decrees of councils; <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decrees; the collection of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> canons; the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, the "leges Visigothorum" and "Baiuwariorum"; the "Libri Penitentiales" or penitential books; the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Church Fathers</a>, and letters of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He repeats himself frequently; a number of chapters are duplicated literally or nearly word for word. The chief aim of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> was to enable the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to maintain its independence in face of the assaults of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. The author stands for the contemporary movement in favour of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform, and in opposition to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The first two editions (Tilius, Paris, 1548, and Pithoeus, Paris, 1588) are incomplete; the collection is found complete in <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a>, Capitularia regum Francorum (Paris, 1677), I, col. 801-1232, and in Pertz, Monumenta Germaniae Hist.: Leges, II (Hanover, 1837), 2, 39-158 (cf. <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XCVII, col. 699-912). E. Seckel is preparing a new edition for the Monum. Germ. Hist.: Capitularia, III).
