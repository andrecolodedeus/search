<h1>Benedict Stattler</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born at K&ouml;tzting, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (<a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Diocese of Ratisbon</a>), 30 Jan., 1728; died at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 21 Aug., 1797. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Landsberg in 1745 and, after the usual studies, taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in Solothurn (Switzerland), <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, and Ingolstadt. In the last-named place he continued to occupy the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> even after the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a>. In 1783, when all former <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were excluded from the office of teaching, he took charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Kemnath, but soon exchanged this post for that of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> adviser and member of the electoral committee on censures in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. After four years his health compelled him to resign this office, and he lived thereafter in retirement till his death. A man of keen <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision and an unlimited capacity for work, Stattler was ever ready to guard and defend <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles. Shortly after Adam Weishaupt had founded the <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret society</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07661b.htm">Illuminati</a>, Stattler, in an anonymous work, laid bare the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and the pernicious designs of these forerunners of <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">freemasonry</a>. <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> "Critique of Pure Reason" appeared in its first edition in 1781; in 1788 Stattler launched against its subversive principles his "Anti-Kant", and skilfully parried the attack which his book provoked in the literary world of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. When the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French revolutionists</a> began to be echoed in his fatherland, he lost no time in pointing out to his compatriots the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> ring which he detected in their boastful promises of liberty. The bulk of his writings, however, is devoted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. It was his avowed purpose to adapt the traditional teachings of the School to the living needs of his time, "to plow anew the entire field of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic philosophy</a> and theology and to fructify it with fresh seeds", as Bishop Sailer of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, Stattler's great pupil, expressed it. With this end in view, he wrote "Philosophia methodo scienti&aelig; propria explanata" (Augsburg, 1769-72) and "Demonstratio Evangelica" (Augsburg, 1770). Yet his attachment to the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> philosophy of Wolff and the far-going concessions he made to <a href="../cathen/14763a.htm">religious toleration</a> and <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a> led him astray and marred the lustre of his merits. The suppression of his order and the consequent loss of wise direction by superiors <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a veritable calamity to him. His "Demonstratio Catholica" (Pappenheim, 1775) fell under the censure of the Roman authorities, and, shortly before his death, his "Loci Theologici" (Weissenburg, 1775), "Theologia Christiana Theoretica" (Ingolstadt and <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1776-79) and two other works were placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a>.
