<h1>Benedictine Abbey of Jumi&egrave;ges</h1>  

<p>Jumi&egrave;ges, situated on the north bank of the Seine, between Duclair and Caudebec, in Normandy (Seine-Inf&eacute;rieure). The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was founded in 634 by St. Philibert, who had been the companion of Sts. Ouen and Wandrille at the Merovingian court. Philibert became first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> but was later on, through the jealousy of certain enemies, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave Jumi&egrave;ges, and afterwards founded another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Noirmo&ucirc;tier, where he died about 685. Under the second <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, St. Achard, Jumi&egrave;ges flourished exceedingly and numbered within its walls nearly a thousand <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Enjoying the patronage of the dukes of <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> became a great centre of religion and learning, its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> producing, amongst many other scholars, the national historian, <a href="../cathen/15633b.htm">William of Jumi&egrave;ges</a>. It reached the zenith of its fame about the eleventh century, and was regarded as a model of perfection for all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the province. It was renowned especially for its charity to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, being popularly called "Jumi&egrave;ges l'Aum&ocirc;nier". In the ninth century it was pillaged and burnt to the ground by the Normans, but was rebuilt on a grander scale by William, Duke of Normandy, surnamed <em>Longue-Ep&eacute;e</em>. The church was enlarged in 1256, and again restored in 1573. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Jumi&egrave;ges took part in all the great affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and nation; one of them, Robert, became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> in 1040; many others became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and some were also raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> dignity. The fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> suffered somewhat through the English invasion of the fifteenth century, but it recovered and maintained its prosperity and high position until the whole province was devastated by the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> and the Wars of Religion. In 1649, during the abbacy of Francis III, Jumi&egrave;ges was taken over by the <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Maurist Congregation</a>, under which rule some of its former grandeur was resuscitated. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, however, closed its career as a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and only its majestic ruins now remain to show what it was in the days of its splendour. These comprise the church, with its beautiful twin towers and western <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, and portions of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. The contents of the latter were removed to <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> when the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was suppressed.
