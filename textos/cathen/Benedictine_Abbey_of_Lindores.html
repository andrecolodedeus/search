<h1>Benedictine Abbey of Lindores</h1>  

<p>On the River Tay, near Newburgh, Fifeshire, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, founded by David, Earl of Huntingdon, younger brother of King William the Lion, about 1191. Boece (Chronicles of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>) gives 1178 as the date, but his romantic story of the foundation (adopted by Walter Scott in "The Talisman") is quite uncorroborated, and almost certainly fictitious. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were Tironensian <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, brought from Kelso; Guido, Prior of Kelso, was the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and practically completed the extensive buildings. The church, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin and St. Andrew, was 195 feet long, with <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> 110 feet long. Earl David richly endowed the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, making over to it the ten <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches which were in his gift, as well as <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and other sources of revenue, and asking nothing in return "save only <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the weal of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>". The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, by the foundation charter, were to be free of all secular and military service, and they gradually acquired extensive powers and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the people living on their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Other churches were granted by the Leslies and subsequent benefactors to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which had finally as many as twenty-two belonging to it. Dowden, in his introduction to the Lindores <a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">chartulary</a>, gives details of these endowments, as well as of the privileges granted to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by successive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>: these do not seem to have differed from those enjoyed by other great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Edward I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, John de Baliol, David II, and James III were among the monarchs who visited Lindores at different times. David, Duke of Rothesay, who perished mysteriously at Falkland Palace, not far off, was buried at Lindores in 1402. Twenty-one <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> ruled the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> from its foundation to its suppression. Lindores was the first of the great <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> to suffer <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> mob, being sacked and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> expelled by the populace of Dundee in 1543. <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">Knox</a> describes a similar scene in 1559: "The abbey of Lindores we reformed; their altars overthrew we; their idols, vestments of idolatrie and mass-books we burnt in their presence, and commanded them to cast away their monkish habits". The last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was the learned and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/09191b.htm">John Leslie</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13201a.htm">Ross</a> (d. 1596). The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was created a temporal lordship in 1600 in favour of Patrick Leslie, in whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> it remained till 1741. It now belongs to the Hays of Leys. The fragments of the buildings which remain are mostly of the twelfth century; they include the groined archway of the principal entrance, and part of the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> walls and of the western tower of the church.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">Chartulary of the Abbey of Lindores, ed. DOWDEN from the Caprington MS., with introduction and appendixes (Edinburgh, Scot. Hist. Soc., 1903). The volume published by the Abbotsford Club (1841, incorrectly called Chartularies of Balmerino and Lindores, is really a sixteenth-century transcript of miscellaneous documents relating to these abbeys. See also LAING, Lindores Abbey and its burgh of Newburgh (Edinburgh, 1876); GORDON, Monasticon, III (Glasgow, 1868), 539-550; DUGDALE, Monasticon Anglicanum, VI (London, 1830), 1150. DOWDEN, op. cit. gives some interesting reproductions of ancient seals of the Chapter and various Abbots of Lindores.</p></div>
