<h1>Benedictine Abbey of Lobbes</h1>  

<p>Located in Hainault, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, founded about 650, by St. Landelin, a converted brigand, so that the place where his crimes had been committed might benefit by his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. As the number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> increased rapidly the saintly founder, desiring to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> his life to austerities rather than to discharge the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, resigned his post. He was succeeded by St. Ursmer, who gave most of his energies to preaching <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> among the still <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a>. More fortunate than most <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, Lobbes preserved its ancient annals, so that its history is known in comparatively minute detail. The "Annales Laubicenses", printed in Pertz, "Mon. Germ. Hist.: Scriptores", should be consulted. The fame of St. Ursmer, his successor St. Ermin, and other holy men soon drew numbers of disciples, and Lobbes became the most important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the period in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, the abbatial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> rising to special fame under Anson, the sixth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. About 864 Hubert, brother-in-law of Lothair II, became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and, by his dissolute life brought the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> into a state of decadence; both temporal and spiritual, from which it did not recover until the accession of Francon. By him the Abbacy of Lobbes was united to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, which he already held, and this arrangement continued until 960, when the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> regained its freedom. The reigns of Abbots Folcuin (965-990) and <a href="../cathen/07264c.htm">Heriger</a> (990-1007) were marked by rapid advance, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> especially attaining a great reputation.

<p>From this period, although the general observance seems on the whole to have continued good, the fame of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> gradually declined until the fifteenth century, when the great monastic revival, originating in the congregation of Bursfeld, brought fresh life into it. In 1569 Lobbes and several other <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, the most important being that of St. Vaast or Vedast at <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>, were combined to form the "Benedictine Congregation of Exempt Monasteries of Flanders", sometimes called the "Congregation of St. Vaast". In 1793 the last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Vulgise de Vignron, was elected. Thirteen months later both <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and community were driven from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by French troops, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 2 September, 1796, decreed their final expulsion. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who numbered forty-three at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, were received into various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and elsewhere; and the conventual buildings were subsequently destroyed, with the exception of the farm and certain other portions that have been incorporated in the railway station.
