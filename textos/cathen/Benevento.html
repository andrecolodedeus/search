<h1>Benevento</h1>  

<p>(BENEVENTANA).

<p>Benevento, the ancient Beneventum, the principal city of the province of the same name in Campania, is situated on the River Calore, and contains a population of 25,000. It was founded at a very early period by the Samnites, who named it Maleventum. In 275 B.C. the Romans, having conquered Pyrrhus not far from there, took possession of the city and changed its name to the present form. In 268 B.C. a Roman colony was established at Beneventum, which was enlarged and beautified by <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> and other emperors. The arch of Trajan (<em>porta aurea</em>), entirely of Parian marble, still bears eloquent witness to the munificence of that emperor. In 545 the city was captured and destroyed by Totila, King of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, but was rebuilt in 589 by the Lombard King Autharis, and made the seat of a duchy. In 1047 it fell into the hands of the Normans, who, however, were forced to relinquish it by <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a> in 1053.

<p>The city, with the surrounding territory, was then turned over to <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a>, a relative of the emperor, in payment of the annual tribute rendered the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>; but shortly afterwards it was reoccupied by the Normans. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> thereupon placed himself at the head of a powerful army "ut saltem humano terrore resipiscerent, qui divina iudicia minime formidant" (that those who fear not the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgments of God</a> may at least repent through human dread; Ep. VII ad Constantin. Monomach.). The opposing forces met at the Dragonara, and after a severe struggle the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> troops were put to flight, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself was forced to retire to Civitella. There Leo wrought more by word of mouth than the arms of all his soldiers had been able to accomplish. The Norman leaders <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> fealty to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>, conducted him back to Benevento with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and continued from that time forward the most devoted and loyal champions of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. This warlike expedition of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> called forth the severe criticism of <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>.

<p>Thenceforward Benevento was a part of the territory of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which was always represented there by a delegate. From 1769 to 1774 it was in the possession of Ferdinand I of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and in 1806 <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> made Talleyrand Duke of Benevento. In 1814 it again came under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; and from 1838 to 1841 Joachim Pecci (later <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>) was civil delegate to this part of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> state in the heart of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> and won great praise for his wise administration and his stern repression of brigandage. In 1860 Benevento was annexed to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>. Most noted among the citizens of Benevento during ancient times are: Papinianus, the jurisconsult, and Arbilius, the grammarian; Popes <a href="../cathen/06031a.htm">Felix IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Victor III (Dauferio)</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06795a.htm">Gregory VIII</a> (Alberto di Morra) who were natives of Benevento; Cardinal Pietro Morra, Giovanni da Castrocelo, Dionisio Lorerio, Nicol&ograve; Coscia, Camillo Domenico, Gennaro de Simone, <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Bartolommeo Pacca</a>, and Carlo Maria Pedieini.

<p>Benevento is the seat of an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdiocese</a>, which has as suffragans the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/01312a.htm">Alife</a>, <a href="../cathen/01710a.htm">Ariano</a>, <a href="../cathen/01774a.htm">Ascoli</a>, and Cerignola, <a href="../cathen/02149c.htm">Avellino</a>, <a href="../cathen/02622a.htm">Boiano</a>, <a href="../cathen/02724b.htm">Bovino</a>, <a href="../cathen/09004a.htm">Larino</a>, <a href="../cathen/09406a.htm">Lucera</a>, <a href="../cathen/13453b.htm">San Severo</a>, Sant' Agata de' Goti, <a href="../cathen/14476a.htm">Telese</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14518a.htm">Termoli</a>.

<p>According to local tradition, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> was first preached there by St. Potinus, at the command of St. Peter the Apostle. At a later period, during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, we find mentioned as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this city <a href="../cathen/08295a.htm">St. Januarius</a>, who together with Proculus, his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and two <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and beheaded at <a href="../cathen/12331a.htm">Pozzuoli</a> in 305. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, which also contains the remains of St. Agrippinus who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Benevento. In 929 Benevento was raised to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, founded at a very early period was rebuilt in 1692, after being destroyed in the earthquake of 1688. The interior, divided into five <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, has fifty-four marble columns, which furnish a magnificent perspective. Mention should also be made of the two thrones near the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, carved about 1311 by a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> named Nicola. Of special historical interest is the so-called "altar of peace", erected in memory of the peace concluded at Benevento between <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, after the famous sack of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1527). The <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is entirely of a yellowish marble; the great central door is of bronze, of Byzantine workmanship, brought from Constantinople in the twelfth century. In the spacious <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> are the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Lombard dukes. The bell tower, constructed almost entirely of the fragments of ancient monuments, was begun by Bishop Capo di Ferro (1254).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Sophia, in form a great rotunda, is also deserving of mention. It dates back to the Lombard epoch, if indeed it is not a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> temple converted into a church. The <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> is particularly remarkable, being set upon six antique Corinthian columns. The church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> delle Grazie is held in great veneration; adjoining it is a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the abode first of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, but since 1450 of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Minor Observance. The <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Madonna with the Child in her arms is said to have been brought from <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> by St. Artelais, niece of Narses, general of the army of Justinian.

<p>A number of councils were held at Benevento: those of 1059, 1061, and 1087, in the last of which <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Victor III</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>; that of 1091, in which the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was renewed, and a number of disciplinary canons formulated; that of 1108 against lay investitures; those of 1113 and 1117, the latter against the <a href="../cathen/06795b.htm">Antipope Burdinus</a>; others in 1119, 1314, 1470, 1545, as recorded by Harduin, in the seventh volume of his collection of the Councils. In the following centuries the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Benevento frequently held <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>. Gian Battista Foppa (1643) and Vincenzo Maria Orsini, O.P. (1686), later <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Pope Benedict XIII</a>, did much to restore and beautify the churches of the city.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> famous in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> of Benevento, passing over some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of uncertain date, are: St. Marcianus (533), St. Zenoe (543), St. Barbatus (663), who had a golden serpent, an object of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> worship of the Lombards, melted and made into a sacred <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> which was preserved up to the time of the French invasion in 1799; Amaldo, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> (1533); Gaspare Colonna, generous in the decoration of churches, who, at the time of the Colonna conspiracy against <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugenius IV</a>, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> with the others, but quickly released; Giovanni della Casa, a distinguished writer and Italian orator (1544); Cardinal Giacomo Savelli (1560), founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Cardinal Pompeio Arrigoni (1607); Cardinal Sinibaldo Doria (1731) who suffered much from the intrigues of Nicol&ograve; Coscia, administrator under the above-mentioned Archbishop Orsini. Doria founded a great <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, subsequently enlarged by Cardinal Francesco Maria Banditi in 1775; Cardinal Domenico Spinucci (1796); Cardinal Camillo Siciliano di Rende (1879).

<p>The Archdiocese of Benevento has a population of 590,500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with 138 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 460 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 839 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 70 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> belonging to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, 350 seminarists, 40 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, and 120 members of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders.
