<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Benjamin</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>binjamin</em>, "son of the right hand").

<p>(1) The youngest son of Jacob born of Rachel. His original name was Ben-oni (Heb. "son of my sorrow"), given to him by his mother just before she died in child-birth, but was changed to Benjamin by Jacob (Gen. xxxv, 18). The <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> reading, <em>Benjamim</em>, i.e. "son of days", would refer to the advanced age of Jacob at the time of Benjamin's birth. Upon the loss of Joseph, Benjamin's full-brother, Jacob's affections were bestowed upon Benjamin, and it was only with great reluctance that he permitted his beloved child to accompany his brethren to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to purchase corn. (Gen. xlii, 36; xlii, 15). Joseph, too, showed a marked preference of Benjamin to his other brethren and puts the latter's mind concerning him to a rather severe test (<a href="../bible/gen044.htm">Genesis 44</a>-<a href="../bible/gen046.htm">46</a>).

<p>(2) The son of Balan and grandson of Benjamin, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob's</a> son (<a href="../bible/1ch007.htm#vrs10">1 Chronicles 7:10</a>).

<p>(3) One of the sons of Herem who had married a foreign wife in the days of Esdras (<a href="../bible/ezr010.htm#vrs32">Ezra 10:32</a>).

<p>(4) One of those who took part in the rebuilding of the walls of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at the time of Nehemias (<a href="../bible/neh003.htm#vrs23">Nehemiah 3:23</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/neh012.htm#vrs33">12:33</a>).

<p>(5) The name of the gate in the northern wall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/jer036.htm#vrs12">Jeremiah 36:12</a>; <a href="../bible/zec014.htm#vrs10">Zechariah 14:10</a>). It is not mentioned by Nehemias in his enumeration of the gates of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/neh003.htm">Nehemiah 3</a>).

<p>(6) The name of the northern gate of the Temple, where Jeremias was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> (<a href="../bible/jer020.htm#vrs2">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; <a href="../bible/jer038.htm#vrs7">38:7, 14</a>), probably the same as "watch-gate" (<a href="../bible/neh012.htm#vrs38">Nehemiah 12:38</a>) and as the one spoken of in Jeremiah (viii, 3, 5, 16; ix, 2).

<p>(7) Name of eastern gate of the ideal <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> as drawn by Ezechiel (<a href="../bible/eze048.htm#vrs32">Ezekiel 48:32</a>).

<p>(8) Name of one of the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> which during the sojourn in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> numbered 35,400 warriors, and according to a second census 45,6000 (num., i, 36; xxvi, 41). The territory assigned to it is defined in Josue, xviii, 11 sqq. It was about twenty-five miles in length and twelve in breadth, and was bounded on the north by Ephraim, on the east by the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, on the south by Juda, and on the west by <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a>. The nature of the territory was conducive to breed a race of hardy warriors such as the Benjamites who are depicted by Jacob as "a ravenous wolf, in the morning [he] shall divide the spoil" (<a href="../bible/gen049.htm#vrs27">Genesis 49:27</a>). During the period of the Judges the tribe was well nigh exterminated on account of a crime committed within its territory (<a href="../bible/jdg019.htm">Judges 19</a>-<a href="../bible/jdg021.htm">21</a>). It was from this tribe that Saul, the first king of the monarchy, was chosen (<a href="../bible/1sa009.htm#vrs1">1 Samuel 9:1, 2, 19</a>; <a href="../bible/1sa010.htm#vrs1">10:1, 20 sqq.</a>). After the death of Saul the tribe of Benjamin remained loyal to his son, Isboseth (<a href="../bible/2sa002.htm#vrs9">2 Samuel 2:9 sqq.</a>), until <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> became king of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/2sa005.htm#vrs1">2 Samuel 5:1-5</a>). At the time of the revolt from Rehoboam the tribes of Benjamin, Juda, and Simeon remained <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and formed the Kingdom of Juda (<a href="../bible/1ki012.htm#vrs21">1 Kings 12:21</a>), which also constituted the nucleus of the restored nation. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> glories in belonging to the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs5">Philippians 3:5</a>).
