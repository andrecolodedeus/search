<h1>Bequests for Masses</h1>  

<p>"The efficacy of <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a>", remarks the Court of Appeals of the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> v. Alcock, 108 (New York Court of Appeals Reports, page 312) "is one of the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a> . . . and those professing that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> are entitled in law to the same respect and protection in their religious observances thereof as those of any other denomination" (p. 329). But the court held to be of no effect a bequest by a testator to his executors of money "to be applied by them for the purpose of having <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> offered in a <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a> to be by them selected for the repose of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of my <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all others who may be in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>". And following this decision the same court, in a later case, declared to be of no effect a bequest by a testator to his executors of a sum of money "to be expended in having masses said for the repose of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" (see O'Conner v. Gifford, 117 New York Court of Appeals Reports, p. 276), or, as rather infelicitously expressed by the judge writing the opinion of the court, "disposed of in the purchase of masses" (p. 283). Notwithstanding "respect and protection" due to <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">"Roman Catholic"</a> religious observances, these legacies failed, because "religious or <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> uses were, when the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> religion prevailed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, recognized as charities" (108 ibid., p. 325), and the court held that the English legal <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on which the validity of charitable uses and trusts depended was not a part of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>. And, since in that state the bequests could not be upheld as charities, their validity was deemed to be open to an objection fatal to the validity of any trust not charitable, namely, "absence of an ascertainable beneficiary" (108 ibid., p. 329; Fosdick v. Town of North Hempstead, 125 ibid., p. 591).

<p>The court in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> case calls attention to the circumstance that its decision adverse to the existence in New York of the English legal doctrine of charities is a denial of the correctness of the Court of Appeals in the previous case of Williams v. Williams, decided in 1853 (8 New York Court of Appeals Reports, p. 525), the doctrine of that case being that <a href="../cathen/15072a.htm">charitable trusts</a> are a part of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the state, "that they came to us by inheritance from our British ancestors and as part of our <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>" (108 ibid., p. 336). The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> case was decided in 1888, the O'Conner case in 1889. The highest court of the state having thus decided that the legal doctrine of the same court in 1853 was <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> and to be no longer adhered to, the legislature of the state enacted in 1893 a statute (Laws of 1893, chapter 701), which has been declared by the Court of Appeals "to restore the ancient doctrine of <a href="../cathen/15072a.htm">charitable uses and trusts</a> as a part of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of this State" (Bowman v. Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, 182 Court of Appeals Reports, p. 498, decided in 1905), "the law of <a href="../cathen/15072a.htm">charitable trusts</a> as declared in the Williams case" (Allen v. Stevens, 161 ibid., p. 141, decided in 1899). As if to approve legislatively what is thus declared judicially, the legislature, by laws becoming effective in 1909 (see Personal Property Law, section 12; Real Property Law, section 113) has re-enacted (with changes immaterial for our present purposes) the statute of 1893.

<p>The reason on which <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> v. Alcock was based having thus ceased to exist, we might, perhaps, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of that case could be deemed to survive. But in this connexion a case decided in 1907 ought to be noticed. This case (Johnston v. Hughes, 187 New York Court of Appeals Reports, p. 446) involved the validity of a bequest of proceeds of real estate to a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> conducted by a corporation, "The <a href="../cathen/12257a.htm">Sisters of the Poor of St. Francis</a>" incorporated for "the gratuitous care of the sick, aged, infirm and <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>", the testator adding to the bequest these words "for the benefit and use of the Blessed Virgin Mary purgatorial fund of said <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>". There had never been maintained any such fund in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. But there was "a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>", observes the court "connected with the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in which they have morning Mass and religious devotions during the day; in which <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers are offered for departed souls</a>" (p. 452). And the court surmises that from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the observance of these religious practices, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> under the charge of the Sisters may derive "comfort and peace of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>", conducive to the physical welfare which the corporation had been chartered to promote (p. 453). The court holds that "an imperative intent on the part of the testator not to make the gift absolute" does not appear (p. 451), and that "the gift was absolute and valid", for the legal purposes of the corporation (p. 454). The Sisters, as <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and apart from regard for the inmates of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, might feel morally bound to <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray for the dead</a>; but the corporation was held to take the bequest for the purposes of the corporate charter, and these were certainly limited to the welfare of the living, "the sick, aged, infirm and poor". The bequest being thus sustained because deemed to be for purposes within the corporate functions of the legatee, the court intimates that if the legatee had not been a corporation, the decision might have been that the bequest was invalid, and invalid on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> case. "In this case", remarks the court, "the bequest was to a corporation duly organized, and it is not therefore subject to the objection that was made in the case of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> vs. Alcock" (p. 453). The fact is not alluded to that the reason for sustaining this objection was the nonexistence in New York of the English law of charities, a reason no longer tenable under the statute of 1893 as construed by the court. We may well regret that this recognition in 1907 of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> vs. Alcock was unaccompanied by any reference to this intervening statute.

<p>Incorporation of <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">"Roman Catholic"</a> Churches has been provided for by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of New York since the year 1863 (see Laws of 1863, chapter 45; and Religious Corporations Law, in effect 1909). The views expressed in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> case, in conjunction with the statute of 1893, seem favourable to the legal competency of a church thus incorporated to accept a testamentary gift charged with a trust of offering public masses for the dead (<em>In re</em> Davidson, English Law Reports, 1 Chancery page 572, <em>anno</em> 1909; cf. Bowman v. Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society <em>sup</em>.). By chapter 732 of the Laws of 1911, "any <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> devised or bequeathed for religious ceremonies, observances or commemorative services of or for the deceased donor" is exempted from transfer tax. This exemption seems to embrace devises and bequests whether to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> or to corporations, and Masses for the repose of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> might, perhaps, be considered to be "commemorative services . . . for the deceased donor" (chapter 795, Laws of 1913). And, possibly, some case involving a question of liability to payment of this tax may cause the Court of Appeals to settle the question whether, notwithstanding the Statute of 1893, bequests and devises for Masses are to be deemed void in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a> in accord with the rulings of the Court in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> case and the O'Conner case.
