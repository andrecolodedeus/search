<h1>Berengarius of Tours</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> about 999; died on the island of St. Cosme, near that city, in 1088. Having completed his elementary studies in his native city, he went to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> in order to study arts and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> under the direction of the famous <a href="../cathen/06312a.htm">Fulbert</a>. There he was distinguished by his curious and quick intelligence. It seems that even at this early time his bent of mind and singular opinions were a source of anxiety to his master. (M. Clerval, Les Ecoles de Chartres au Moyen Age, <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, 1895.) After the death of <a href="../cathen/06312a.htm">Fulbert</a> (1029) Berengarius left Chartres and took charge, as <em>scholasticus</em>, of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>. His reputation spread rapidly and attracted from all parts of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> numerous and distinguished disciples, who afterwards held positions of importance in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Among them are mentioned, though there is some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the first two, <a href="../cathen/07350b.htm">Hildebert of Lavardin</a> who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, <a href="../cathen/05616b.htm">Eusebius Bruno</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, Frolland, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Senlis, Paulinus, dean of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>. In 1039 Berengarius was chosen <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Angers by Hubert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city. Berengarius accepted this office, but continued to live at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> and direct his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.

<p>It was about 1047 that the teaching of Berengarius touching the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> began to attract attention. In the Eucharistic controversy of the ninth century, Radbert Paschasius, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Corbie, in his <em>De Corpore et Sanguine Domini</em> (831), had maintained the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> the bread is converted into the real body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, into the very body which was born of Mary and crucified. Ratramnus, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, defended the opinion that in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> there is no conversion of the bread; that the body of Christ is, nevertheless, present, but in a spiritual way; that it is not therefore the same as that born of Mary and crucified. John <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Erigena had supported the view that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the altar are figures of the body of Christ; that they are a memorial of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body and blood of Christ. (P. Batiffol, Etudes d'histoire et de th&eacute;ologie positive, 2d series, Paris, 1905.) When, therefore, Hugues, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01141b.htm">Adelman</a> <em>&eacute;col&acirc;tre</em> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, discussed Berengarius's teachings on this subject, the latter answered by appealing to the authority of Erigena. It was at this point that <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Le Bec, attacked as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> the opinion of Erigena and defended the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Radbert Paschasius. Berengarius, in his defense, wrote a letter which <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> received in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> whither he had gone to take part in a council. The letter was read in this council (1050); Berengarius was condemned, and was ordered to appear at a council which was to be held the same year at <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>. King Henry I being titular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, Berengarius applied to him for permission to go to the council. It is probable that at this time the conferences of Brionne and Chartres were held in which Berengarius unsuccessfully defended his opinions. (Cf. Durand of Troarn, Liber de Corpore et Sanguine Christi, xxxiii, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXLIX, 1422.) The king, for reasons which are not exactly known, ordered Berengarius to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and at the council of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> (1050) his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was examined and condemned.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, however, did not last long. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, <a href="../cathen/05616b.htm">Eusebius Bruno</a>, was his disciple and supporter, and the Count of Anjou, Geoffrey Martel, his protector. The following year, by order of Henry I, a <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a> was held in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to judge Berengarius and <a href="../cathen/05616b.htm">Eusebius Bruno</a>; neither was present, and both were condemned. At the Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (1055), presided over by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, Berengarius signed a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> wherein he confessed that after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> are truly the body and blood of Christ. At another council held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1059, Berengarius was present, retracted his opinions, and signed a formula of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, drawn up by Cardinal Humbert, affirming the real and sensible presence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body of Christ in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XIX, 900.) On his return, however, Berengarius attacked this formula. <a href="../cathen/05616b.htm">Eusebius Bruno</a> abandoned him, and the Count of Anjou, Geoffrey the Bearded, vigorously opposed him. Berengarius appealed to <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Pope Alexander II</a>, who, though he intervened in his behalf, asked him to renounce his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> opinions. This Berengarius contemptuously refused to do. He then wrote his <em>De Sacr&acirc; Coen&acirc; adversus Lanfrancum Liber Posterior</em>, the first book of which &#151; now lost &#151; had been written against the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> held in 1059. He was again condemned in the Councils of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> (1075), and of St. Maixeut (1076), and in 1078, by order of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a>, he came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in a council held in St. John Lateran signed a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> affirming the conversion of the bread into the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, born of the Virgin Mary. The following year, in a council held in the same place Berengarius signed a formula affirming the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in a more explicit way. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> then recommended him to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> and Angers, forbidding that any penalty should be inflicted on him or that anyone should call him a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Berengarius, on his return, again attacked the formula he had signed, but as a consequence of the Council of Bordeaux (1080) he made a final retraction. He then retired into solitude on the island of St. Cosme, where he died, in union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.


<h2>Doctrines and their condemnation</h2>

<p>According to some of their contemporaries, Berengarius held <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> opinions about the spiritual power, marriage, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of children, and other points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. (<a href="../cathen/02512c.htm">Bernold of Constance</a>, De Berengerii haeresiarchae damnatione multiplici in P.L., CXLIX, 1456; Guitmond, De Corporis et Sanguinis Christi veritate in Eucharisti&acirc;, P.L., CXLIX, 1429, 1480.) But Berengarius's fundamental <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerns the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>.

<p>In order to understand his opinion, we must observe that, in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, Berengarius had <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> tendencies and was a nominalist. Even in the study of the question of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he held that reason is the best guide. Reason, however, is dependent upon and is limited by sense-perception. Authority, therefore, is not conclusive; we must reason according to the data of our senses. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Berengarius denied <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> (we mean the substantial conversion expressed by the word; the word itself was used for the first time by <a href="../cathen/07350b.htm">Hildebert of Lavardin</a>); it is not absolutely certain that he denied the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, though he certainly held <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> views regarding it. Is the body of Christ present in the Eucharist, and in what manner? On this question the authorities appealed to by Berengarius are, besides <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Erigena, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. These fathers taught that the Sacrament of the Altar is the figure, the sign, the token of the body and blood of the Lord. These terms, in their mind, apply directly to what is external and sensible in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> and do not, in any way, imply the negation of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">real presence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body of Christ. (St. Aug. Serm. 143, n.3; Gerbert, Libellus De Corp. et Sang. Domini. n. 4, P.L., CXXXIX, 177.) For Berengarius the body and blood of Christ are <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">really present</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>; but this presence is an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> or spiritual presence. The substance of the bread and the substance of the wine remain unchanged in their nature, but by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> they become spiritually the very body and blood of Christ. This spiritual body and blood of Christ is the <em>res sacramenti</em>; the bread and the wine are the figure, the sign, the token, <em>sacramentum</em>.

<p>Such is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Berengarius in his various discussions, letters, and writings up to the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1059. (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> P.L., CXLII, 1327; CL, 66; Mart&egrave;ne and Durand, Theasaurus Novus Anecdotorum, Paris, 1717, IV.) At this council, Berengarius signed a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> affirming that the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> are not only a sign, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body and blood of Christ which can be perceived in a sensible and real manner. (<a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, De Corp. et Sang. Domini, ii, in P.L., CL, 410.) As already said, Berengarius retracted this confession. He maintained that the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, without any change in their nature, become by <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the sacrament of the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, a memorial of the body crucified and of the blood shed on the cross. It is not, however, the body of Christ as it is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; for how could the body of Christ which is now in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, necessarily limited by space, be in another place, on several altars, and in numerous hosts? Yet the bread and the wine are the sign of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">actual and real presence</a> of the body and blood of Christ. (De Sacr&acirc; Coen&acirc;; <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, op. cit.)

<p>In the two councils of Lateran (1078 and 1079) Berengarius accepts and signs this profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that <em>after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the bread is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the very body born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a></em> &#151; that <em>the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, by the mystery of the sacred <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and words of our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer</a>, are substantially converted into the very flesh and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and life-giving</em>, etc. (Mart&egrave;ne et Durand, op. cit., IV, 103; <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion, Wurzburg, 1900, n. 298.) In his explanation of this profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, written after the council, Berengarius again clearly denies <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a>. He declares that, at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>, by virtue of the Lord's blessing, the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, keeping their natural properties, received a power of sanctification and became the sacrament of His body and blood; that the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> on the altar are the very body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and human body. (artene et Durand, op. cit., IV, 107.) From all of which we conclude that, during his life, and before his final profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, Berengarius certainly denied <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a>. As to the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">real presence</a>, his thought is rather obscure and his attitude hesitating. There is much divergence of opinion among historians and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> on the interpretation of Berengarius's doctrines about this point, if it does not appear clearly that he denies the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, if perhaps the difficulty for him is in the mode rather than in the fact of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">real presence</a>; yet his exposition of it, together with his principles of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, endanger the fact itself of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> and sounds very much like a negative of it.
<h2>Influences</h2>

<p>Outside of <a href="../cathen/05616b.htm">Eusebius Bruno</a>, who supported Berengarius, at least for a time, no <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of importance systematically defended his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers of his own and the following period that the influence of his principles was widespread and caused serious disturbance. (Guitmund, op. cit. in P.L., CXLIX, 1429 sqq.; Durand of Troarn, Liber de Corp. et Sang. Christi, in P.L., CXLIX, 1421.) The writers of the following century continue their dissertations against the <em>New Berengarians</em> (cf. Gregorius Barbarigo in <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter's</a> Sanctorum Patrum opuscula selecta, XXXIX); they find traces of his influence in various current phrases and sometimes warn against expressions which might be understood in the Berengarian sense. The Council of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> (1095) again condemned Berengarius' <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. His teachings favoured, at least to some extent, the diverse <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> about the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, as also the Sacramentarians of the sixteenth century. The great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the time were unanimous in protesting against his principles, attacking his opinion as contrary to the teaching of tradition and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Among them we may mention especially <a href="../cathen/01141b.htm">Adelman</a>, Scholasticus of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>; Hugues, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>; <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, then <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Le Bec; Guitmund, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02151a.htm">Aversa</a>; Durand, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Martin of Troarn; <a href="../cathen/02512c.htm">Bernold of Constance</a>, and others, most of them <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. (L. Biginelli, I benedittini e gli studi eucaristici nel medio evo, Turin, 1895.)

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Berengarius, as is the case with other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> was the occasion which favoured and even necessitated, a more explicit presentation, and a more precise formulation of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> about the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. Some expressions, among those used even by the adversaries of the Berengarian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, were corrected. It was <a href="../cathen/07350b.htm">Hildebert of Lavardin</a>, a contemporary of Berengarius if not his pupil, who first used the word <em>transubstantiation</em>. (Sermones xciii; P.L., CLXXI, 776.) The Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1079 in its condemnation of Berengarius, expresses more clearly than any document before it, the nature of this substantial change; and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, in his definition of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> uses almost the same terms as the council. (Sum. Theol., III, Q. lxxv, a. 4.) Though the feast of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> was officially established only in the thirteenth century, its institution was probably occasioned by these eucharistic controversies. The same may be said of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the elevation of the Host after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>.

<p>There is no complete edition of the works of Berengarius. Only one volume has been published by Visher in Berlin (1834) containing the second part of his <em>De Sacr&acirc; Coen&acirc;</em>, under the title: <em>Berengarii Turonensis opera quae Supersunt tam inedita quam edita, I, De Sacra Coena adversus Lanfrancum liber posterior</em>. Others of his opinions and writings are to be found in the works quoted above and in P.L., CL, 63, 66; H. Sudendorf, <em>Berengarius Turonensis oder eine Sammlung ihn betreffender Briefe</em> (Hamburg, 1850).
