<h1>Berlin</h1>  

<p>Capital of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a>, and residence of the German Emperor and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a>, King. It is situated in the heart of the Mark of Brandenburg, on both sides of the Spree above its entrance into the Havel. The city covers an area of 24-1/2 sq. miles and had, 1 December, 1905, 2,040,148 inhabitants, not including the population of the suburbs which are virtually parts of the city. Of the inhabitants of Berlin 223,948 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 1,695,251 are <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; 98,893 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and 22,056 belong to other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The present city of Berlin has grown out of two settlements of the Wends: Kolln, lying on an island in the Spree, and Berlin, opposite, on the right bank of the Spree. Kolln is mentioned for the first time in an official document <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1237; Berlin, in 1244. Even at this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> both places possessed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Brandenburgian cities, but were not equal in importance to other cities of the Mark. A number of old churches, which are still among the most important ones of the city, testify to the active <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> prevalent at this early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, as: the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Mary, erected at the end of the thirteenth century; the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nicholas; the church of the Grey Monastery (<em>Kirche des grauen Klosters</em>), a Gothic edifice built at the end of the thirteenth century. Altogether there were about eighteen church-buildings in Berlin before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. It was not until the two towns were united into one community, in 1307, that the place grew to be of some importance. In the tumultuous times which prevailed in the Mark of Brandenburg during the fourteenth century, Berlin and Frankfort-on-the-Oder became the leaders of the confederation of the cities against the nobles, and joined the Hanseatic League. When the Emperor Charles IV obtained the Mark from the house of Wittelsbach, Berlin rose against him, but was defeated and compelled to open its gates to the emperor. Berlin paid an unwilling obedience to Frederick I of Hohenzollern who made his entry into the city in 1415. When the Elector <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> again separated the two cities and erected a fortified castle between Berlin and Kolln, on the site of the present royal residence, the inhabitants, under the leadership of Bernd Ryke, revolted, stormed the house in which the elector was accustomed to live when in Berlin, and destroyed the public records. Frederick conquered the rebels and took from the city its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and other privileges. In 1451 the castle was completed; Elector John Cicero chose it for his usual residence, which greatly increased the importance of Berlin. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> found ready acceptance in Berlin, and after the death of Joachim I (see <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">BRANDENBURG</a>) it triumphed over the old Faith. The nobility living in the neighbourhood of Berlin accepted the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> at Teltow, April, 1539, and the Elector Joachim II, in the same year, followed their example. On the 2d of November the first celebration of the Lord's Supper according to the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Rite took place at Berlin in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church, which was later transformed into a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1540 the new church ritual for the Mark was settled and printed at Berlin. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in a short time gained a complete ascendancy, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were suppressed, and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Father Petrus (d. 1571) was the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Berlin until the coming of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> about one hundred and fifty years later.

<p>The city suffered greatly during the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>, its population sinking to 4,000 in consequence of a plague. It slowly recovered from the injuries inflicted by this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> during the reign of Frederick William, the Great Elector, grew in size, and was surrounded by new fortifications. Immigrants from the Low Countries and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>, who brought many branches of industry with them, raised the number of inhabitants to 20,000. Frederick I made Berlin the royal residence and adorned it with many fine buildings, the most famous architect and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> of the time being Schluter. In 1709 Frederick introduced a common government for the five divisions of the city which had gradually grown up. In 1696 he founded the Academy of Fine Arts, and in 1700 the Academy of Sciences, of which Leibnitz was the first president. Berlin suffered greatly during the Seven Years War, in the course of which it was seized and plundered in 1575 by the Austrians, and in 1760 by the Russians; but under the wise rule of Frederick the great (<a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>) it rapidly recovered from the damage done to it and became an important centre of commerce, industry, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life. The number of inhabitants increased to 115,000. Frederick William II also spent large sums of money in beautifying the royal city. Under Frederick William II there was a temporary check to its development during the era of the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> ascendancy. In 1808 the city acquired the right of self-government to a limited degree, and in 1809 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Berlin was founded. During the long period of peace which followed the downfall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> a new development of the city began and its artistic embellishment of Schinkel, Rauch, <a href="../cathen/13518a.htm">Schadow</a>, and others made rapid progress. In 1838 the first railway, from Berlin to Potsdam, was opened; the railway traffic increased the industrial importance of the city, and in 1844 the first large industrial exhibition of the German States belonging to the customs-union was held here. On the 15th of March, 1848, a revolution broke out; more than 1,000 barricades were erected, and encounters between the soldiers and the populace occurred; on the 18th of March a bloody struggle took place in the streets of Berlin in which the soldiers were victorious, but they afterwards withdrew from the city at the order of the king. In 1871 Berlin became the capital of the new <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. From 13 June to 13 July, 1878, were held the sessions of the Berlin Congress; since this date Berlin has developed into a great <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>; it has become the most important industrial city of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> continent, the most important railway centre, and one of the chief commercial cities of the empire.



<p>For about one hundred and fifty years after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> was suppressed in Berlin; public <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church services were forbidden; Mass could be said only in the private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> embassies. As late as 1653 the elector was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to promise the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> diet that he would not allow private or public <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church services. In order to be able to raise troops more easily in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts Frederick William I in 1720 gave the first permission for the holding of public <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> services in a private house in Berlin; soon after this the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was fitted up. The pastoral care was exercised by <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> from Halberstadt; the saintly Father Bruhns being particularly successful in his labours. The conquest of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Silesia by Frederick the Great drew many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to Berlin, and the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Hedwig was built for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community (1747-73), Frederick the Great giving the ground. He also built a small church at the home for disabled soldiers, for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pensioners. The addition of large <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> territories in consequence of the partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, the secularization of 1802-03, and that of 1815 by the Vienna Congress likewise increased the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Berlin, but it was not until 1848 that they obtained more freedom. Since then the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population has kept pace with the development of the municipality. Under Frederick the Great the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was about 5,000 in 107,000 inhabitants; in 1817 there were 186,570 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to 6,157 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; in 1843, 16,453 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, to 328,253 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; 1853, 19,075 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 1871, 51,517; 1885, 99,579; 1900, 188,440 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Berlin proper. Church buildings did not increase in the same ratio, and the need of more edifices grew continually greater. With the aid of the whole of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> a number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches was erected in the decade beginning with 1890 to meet this want, but the construction of new church buildings, especially in the rapidly growing environs and suburbs of Berlin is still one of the most imperative needs of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the capital of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>Ecclesiastically, Berlin belongs to the Delegation of the Mark of Brandenburg, which is under a delegate of the Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>; the delegate is the Provost of St. Hedwig's in Berlin. The Archipresbyterate of Berlin embraces the city of Berlin with the exception of a small part of Friedrichsberg (2,686 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>), and includes also the suburbs called Treptow, Straulau, Schoneberg, and a part of Charlottenburg (as far as the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Matthias); the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the presbyterate numbered in 1907, 239,666, of whom 221,262 lived in Berlin proper. The other suburbs, both large and small, belong to the Archipresbyterate of Charlottenburg. In 1907 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Berlin consisted of 13 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of higher rank (the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 5 military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>), 31 assistant <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in other positions, and 15 living in community--altogether 66 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom 26 do not come from the <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Diocese of Breslau</a>. The archipresbyterate is divided for the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> into 14 districts composed of 8 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 6 vicariates; in 1907 another vicariate was in process of erection. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> soldiers are formed into 6 church communities or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; Berlin is also the seat of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> field-provostship for the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> army and the imperial navy. In 1907 Berlin had 8 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and 18 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> where public church services were held; these with the private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> made 31 church edifices; 1 church building and 1 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> were then in process of construction. With the exception of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Hedwig and the church in the home for invalided soldiers, all of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church buildings of Berlin were erected in more recent times. The principal churches are: St. Hedwig (1747-73--see above); in the style of the Pantheon at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; St. Michael, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> garrison-church of Berlin (1851-61) in early <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style; St. Sebastian, the largest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church of Berlin (1890-93) in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, tower 269 feet high; St. Paul, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church (1892-93) in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style; St. Matthew, a Gothic building (1893-95), tower 302 feet high; St. Pius (1898-94), rather tasteless Gothic; St. John, the second <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> garrison church and one of the largest buildings of Berlin (1894-97), in Romanesque style; church of the Heart of Jesus (<em>Herz-Jesukirche</em>), Romanesque style (1897-98).
<h2>Schools</h2>

<p>There has been no public <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys in Berlin since the struggle between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the State (<em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>) swept away the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Progymnasium; there is, however a private higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys with about 130 pupils. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> boys who attend the state and city high-schools are divided, for purposes of religious instruction, into twelve groups of four sections each. There are 3 higher <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls; two of these prepare teachers, and one is conducted by the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> and includes a conservatory of music. There are 30 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for primary instruction, attended by over 20,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children, namely the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Hedwig and 29 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> town-district <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.
