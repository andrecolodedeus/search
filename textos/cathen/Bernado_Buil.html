<h1>Bernado Buil</h1>  

<p>(Also Boil or Boyal.)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a>. The fact that there were two religious of the name of Bernardo Boil living in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> at the same time has given rise to much confusion and even to the opinion that they were not two distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but that the same individual was at one time a member of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> order, and later became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>. It seems however, more probable to assert that Bernardo Boil, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, was a different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from Bernardo Boyl, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>. It was to the former that Alexander Vl addressed his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 25 June, 1493, appointing him first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. This appears to be certain, first of all from the opening words "Dilecto filio Bernardo Boil, fratri Ordinis Minorum", etc. of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> itself, a part of which is reproduced in the first volume of THE CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA. In the second place, the concluding words of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, where reference is made to the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> concerning members of <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> taking new domiciles without permission from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, seem clearly to indicate that the <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">papal rescript</a> was intended for Boil, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, and not for his namesake the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>. It is a matter of fact, however, that Bernardo Boyl, 0.S.B., became first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. This was due to the intrigues of King Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> who employed Boyl, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, to great advantage in several important diplomatic negotiations and had sought his appointment as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> in America. When the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> arrived in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, ignoring the king's choice, and nominating a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> of the same name with the trifling difference of the <em>i</em> and <em>y</em>, which letters were pronounced alike, the only exception being in the order to which the respective <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> belonged, it became convenient to conclude that a mistake had been made in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>--which interpretation Ferdinand found expedient to favour his own ends and views. A <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> copy of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was therefore made with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> changes and delivered to Boyl, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, while appointing Boil, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>. In time this latter document disappeared so completely that no trace of it could be found in the Spanish archieves. A copy, however, was carefully preserved in the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and was brought to light by the researches of the historian Roselly. Bernado Boil, O.F.M., never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of the high dignity which <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> had conferred upon him. It is certain he did not leave <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; yet he was de jure the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, legitimate, and first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> . As regards Bernardo Boyl, O.S.B., it is a matter of history that his labours were without fruit, and the only record of his official action in America is the fulmination of censures.
