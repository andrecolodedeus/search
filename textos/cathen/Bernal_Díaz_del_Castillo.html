<h1>Bernal D&iacute;az del Castillo</h1>  

<p>(Corruption of Bernardo), Spanish historian, one of the chief chroniclers of the conquest of Mexico by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, b. at Medina del Campo, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, c. 1498; d. after 1568. Born of poor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, he began his military career as a common soldier. In 1514, he went to America with Pedrarias D&aacute;vila who had shortly before been appointed governor of Darien. Thence he betook himself to Cuba and enlisted in the expedition to <a href="../cathen/15737b.htm">Yucat&aacute;n</a> under Francisco de C&oacute;rdoba in 1517. He proceeded to Mexico with Grijalva in 1518 and returning to <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, set out a third time for Mexico under the banner of <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Hernando Cort&eacute;s</a>. He took part, he tells us, in 119 battles, and was present at the surrender of the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">city of Mexico</a> im 1521. As a reward for distinguished services he received a commission as <em>regidor</em> or governor of Santiago de los Caballeros in <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, where he made his home. In 1552, <a href="../cathen/06632a.htm">G&oacute;mara</a>, secretary and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cort&eacute;s</a>, published at Saragossa his "Cr&oacute;nica de la Conquista de Nueva Espa&ntilde;a", in which D&iacute;az thought he gave undue credit to <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cort&eacute;s</a>. D&iacute;az, therefore, in 1568 undertook to write his "Verdadera Historia de la Conquista de Nueva Espa&ntilde;a", and though despairing of his ability to equal <a href="../cathen/06632a.htm">G&oacute;mara's</a> literary polish, he determined to write a faithful narrative of the stirring events in which he had taken part, in order to correct the gross inaccuracies of <a href="../cathen/06632a.htm">G&oacute;mara</a>, who had never even been in America, and to vindicate the valour of himself and others who had been completely overshadowed by the exaggerated reputation of <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cort&eacute;s</a>. The work lay neglected and unpublished until, in 1632, Father Alonso Rem&oacute;n of the Order of Our Lady of Mercy, found it in a private <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and had it published at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. The work is crude and devoid of style, and shows the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and vanity of the author, but it will always be read with interest as being the work of an eyewitness and participant in the events described.

<p>In 1689, Francisco de Fuentes, in his history of <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, set forth his claim to be a descendant of D&iacute;az, and gave certain facts concerning him and his work that had been until then unknown. It would seem that, although poor, the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of D&iacute;az was noble and distinguished, for his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was regidor of the important town of Medina del Campo. Fuentes also declared that the work was not published as written by D&iacute;az, as it was not printed from the original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> but from an unauthorized copy in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of one Ram&iacute;rez del Prado which fell into the hands of Father Rem&oacute;n. The original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, he claims, was in his own possession. "La Biblioteca de Autores Espanoles" (1848-86) of <a href="../cathen/13029a.htm">Rivadeneira</a> contains the entire works of D&iacute;az. A German translation by P.J. de Rehfues-Bonn-Marcas was published in 1838.
