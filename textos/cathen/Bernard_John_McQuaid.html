<h1>Bernard John McQuaid</h1>  

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester, U. S. A.; born in New York City, 15 December, 1823; died at Rochester, 18 January, 1909. His father, Bernard McQuaid, from Tyrone, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, settled in Powel's Hook (now Jersey City), New Jersey. It was in the McQuaid home that Mass was first said in Powel's Hook, by Father John Conron, on the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, November, 1829. After his college course at Chambly, Quebec, young McQuaid entered St. John's Seminary, at <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in old St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, 16 January, 1848. Most of the <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">State of New Jersey</a> was at that time included in the Diocese of New York, so Father McQuaid was sent as assistant to the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Madison. When the <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Diocese of Newark</a> was created in 1853, Bishop Bayley made Father McQuaid <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, and later, in 1866, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. With the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he founded Seton Hall College, and, without giving up his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> charge or his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> office, was its president for ten years. He helped to establish the Madison, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, foundation of the Seton Sisters of Charity. When the Civil War broke out he was the first <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> at <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a> to espouse publicly the cause of the Union; he also volunteered as a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and accompanied the New Jersey Brigade to the seat of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, during which service he was captured by the Confederates. On the creation of the <a href="../cathen/13102a.htm">Diocese of Rochester</a> in 1868, Father McQuaid was appointed its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, 12 July, 1868. He was installed in Rochester, on July 16. A man of strong character and untiring as a worker, he especially devoted himself to the cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In Rochester within ten years he completely organized a splendid <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system, taught by <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and affiliated it with the State <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Two years after he took charge of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he opened St. Andrew's Preparatory Seminary, the promising students of which he sent to the Roman and other famous <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. Meantime he was constantly extending the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> throughout the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; founding new <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, or strengthening those already established; securing freedom of worship and their constitutional <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> for the inmates of the state institutions, of which there are four in the diocese. The crowning event of his career was the opening, in 1893, of St. Bernard's Seminary, which he lived to see expanded to an institution patronized by students from twenty-six other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, regarded by the whole country as a model of its kind. Bishop McQuaid attended the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in 1870. In 1905 he asked for a coadjutor, and Bishop Thomas F. Hickey was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 24 May, 1905. (See <a href="../cathen/13102a.htm">DIOCESE OF ROCHESTER</a>.)
