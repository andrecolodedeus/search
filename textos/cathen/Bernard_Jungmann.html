<h1>Bernard Jungmann</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a>, born at M&uuml;nster in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, 1 March, 1833; died at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, 12 Jan., 1895. He belonged to an intensely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>; like him, two of his brothers entered the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, one joining the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and the other becoming a missionary in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. After finishing his studies with brilliant success at the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of his native town, he entered the German College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> through the mediation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> secretary, afterwards <a href="../cathen/10156a.htm">Cardinal Melchers</a>, and made his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in the Gregorian College. In 1854 he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy; he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 8 June, 1857, and two years later received the degree of Doctor of Theology. He then returned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and worked for a short time as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in the church of St. Adelgunde at Emmerich. Bishop Malou of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, who chanced to be present in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1854 when Jungmann made his public defence of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> theses, called him in September, 1861, to the chair of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <em>Petit S&eacute;minaire</em> at Roulers. Four years later (1865) he became professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>. Even at Roulers, while performing his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as teacher, he began that literary activity, which was thenceforth ever associated with his professorial <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. His appointment to the chair of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, in succession to <a href="../cathen/15715a.htm">Wouters</a>, opened in 1871 a wider field for his great ability. A keen <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> with powers of clear exposition, joined to the spirited delivery which distinguished his lectures, ensured him great success. He enlarged the field of ecclesiastico-historical studies by delivering special lectures on patrology, and establishing in 1890 a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, in which students were to receive a scientific and methodical training in original historical research.

<p>Jungmann remained to the end of his life a professor at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, declining the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a call to be professor of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> in the newly founded Catholic University at Washington. He was seized with a fit of apoplexy at the burial of a colleague, and died at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1895. His activity as a writer was equal to his energy as a lecturer. As professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> he wrote "Demonstratio christiana. I. Demonstrationis christian&aelig; pr&aelig;ambula philosophica" (Roulers, 1864; 2nd ed., 1867). In the domain of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> he wrote his "Institutiones theologi&aelig; dogmatic&aelig; specialis" in five tracts, widely used and much appreciated for their clear style: "De Gratia" (Bruges, 1866; 5th ed., Ratisbon, 1882); "De Deo uno et trino" (Bruges, 1867; 4th ed., Ratisbon, 1882); "De Deo Creatore" (Bruges, 1868; 4th ed., Ratisbon, 1883); "De Verbo incarnato" (Bruges, 1869; 4th ed., Ratisbon, 1884); "De quattuor novissimis" (Ratisbon, 1871; 3rd ed., 1885). He wrote also the "Institutiones theologi&aelig; dogmatic&aelig; generalis" (Bruges, 1871; 4th ed., Ratisbon, 1886). In <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> he first re-edited <a href="../cathen/15715a.htm">Wouter's</a> "Histori&aelig; ecclesiastic&aelig; compendium" (3 vols., Louvain, 1879), and later published special studies, particularly on <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversies and on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>: "Dissertationes select&aelig; in historiam ecclesiasticam" (5 vols., Ratisbon, 1880). In patrology he issued <a href="../cathen/06051a.htm">Fessler's</a> excellent "Institutiones Patrologi&aelig;" in a new and much enlarged edition (2 vols., Innsbruck, 1890, 1892, 1896). He contributed numerous articles to German and French journals, particularly worthy of mention being: "Die neue franz&ouml;sische Fortschrittsphilosophie" in the "Katholik" (Mainz, 1865); "Die hl. M&auml;rtyrer von Gorkum", ibid. (1867); "Clemens V. und die Aufhebung des Templerordens" in the "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r kath. Theologie" (Innsbruck, 1881); "Le caract&egrave;re moral de Luther" in "La Controverse" (1883).
