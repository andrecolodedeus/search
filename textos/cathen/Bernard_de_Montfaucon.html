<h1>Bernard de Montfaucon</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> scholar, b. in 1655, at the ch&acirc;teau de Soulatge, Department of Aude, <em>arrondissement</em> of Carcassone; d. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, at the Abbey of St-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, in 1741. He was the son of Timol&eacute;on de Montfaucon and of Flore de Maignan. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, originally of Gascony, had settled in Languedoc after the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> of the thirteenth century; its principal seat was the ch&acirc;teau of Roquetaillade (<em>arrondissement</em> of Limoux), where Bernard was reared. He was instructed by <a href="../cathen/11594a.htm">Pavillon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aleth, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> friend, and in 1672, at the age of thirteen, he entered the Acad&eacute;mie des Cadets at <a href="../cathen/11700b.htm">Perpignan</a>, to prepare for a military career. After his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death, he left home with his relative, the Marquis d'Hautpol, a captain of grenadiers in the Regiment of Languedoc, and served as a volunteer under Turenne (1673). He went through the campaign of Alsace, was at the battle of Marienthal, and fell dangerously ill at Saverne. In pursuance of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, he then returned to his own country, resolved upon entering religion. On 13 May, 1676, he made his profession in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Durade, at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. Being sent to the Abbey of Soreze, he there learned Greek, making rapid progress. He next spent eight years at the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of la Grasse (Aude). Claude Martin, assistant superior of the Congregation of St-Maur, noted his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be sent to the Abbey of Sainte-Croix at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. Finally, in 1687, he was transferred to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to the Abbey of St-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, which, under the rule of <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, had become one of the chief centres of French erudition. He was then chosen to assist in preparing the edition of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> which the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> had undertaken. To perfect his own training, he also began the study of Hebrew, Chaldean, Syriac, and Coptic, as well as that of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a>, and in 1694 was appointed curator of the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatic</a> collection at St-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s.

<p>In 1690 Montfaucon had published a treatise on "La v&eacute;rit&eacute; de l'histoirede Judith". The monumental edition of the works of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, on which he laboured with Dom Pouget and Dom Lopin, appeared in 1698 and was well received (3 vols., folio, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; reproduced in P.G., XXV-XXVIII). Before undertaking new patristic labours, he resolved to study the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Obtaining permission in 1698, he set out with Dom Paul Briois. At <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> he made the acquaintance of Muratori; at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> he was received very coldly, and was not even allowed to see the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of San Giorgio Maggiore and San Marco. On the other hand, he was welcomed at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and especially at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>. Having been named by his superiors <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> general at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of the Order of St. Benedict, certain difficulties with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> led to his resignation of that office which brought with it so many distractions from his chief work, and in 1701 he secured his recall to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The scientific results of his journey were embodied in the quarto volume of his "Diarium Italicum" (Paris, 1702). He also collected the notes of his companion, Dom Paul Briois, who had died on the journey (edited by Omont, "Revue des Bibliotheques", XIV, 1904).

<p>In the full maturity of his powers, at liberty to satisfy his passion for work, with a large experience of life and an intense fund of general information, Montfaucon now took up his abode at the Abbey of St-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, where he spent the last forty years of his life. Here a choice body of scholars gathered around him, his avowed disciples, whose affection for their master prompted them to take the name of "Bernardins". Among these were Claude de Vic and Joseph Vaissette, authors of the "Histoire de Languedoc", the hellenist Charles de la Rue (his favourite disciple), Dom Lobineau, the historian of Brittany, and even the Abb&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost, who was then a collaborator on the <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana"</a>. Montfaucon, moreover, corresponded with scholars all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and, in spite of the heavy tasks he took upon himself, he succeeded, thanks to his abstemious and regular life, in working almost to his last day. During this, his most productive period, he supplemented the former edition of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> with a "Collectio nova patrum et scriptorum graecorum" (2 vols., folio, Paris, 1706). In 1709 he translated into French the "De vita contemplativa" of Philo Jud&aelig;us, and essayed to prove that the Therapeutae there mentioned were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Next appeared the edition of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (2 vols., fol., Paris, 1713) and that of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (13 vols., folio, Paris, 1718), prepared with the assistance of Fran&ccedil;ois Faverolles, treasurer of St-Denis, and four <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, who spent thirteen years in collating 300 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.

<p>The thoroughly scientific bent of Montfaucon's mind led him to elaborate a new auxiliary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> out of the studies he had made for the verification of his Greek texts. As <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> had created the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of diplomatics, so Montfaucon was the father of Greek palaeography, the principles of which he established by the rigour of his method in grouping his personal observations. His great "Palaeographia Graeca" (folio, Paris, 1708) inaugurated the scientific study of Greek texts. Another auxiliary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of history, that of bibliography, owes to him a work still of considerable value, the "Bibliotheca bibliothecarum manuscriptorum nova" (2 vols., folio, Paris, 1739), a catalogue of the Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the chief <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Lastly, Montfaucon <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitively</a> saw what benefit might accrue to history from the study of figured monuments, and, if he was not the creator of archaeology, he was at least the first to show what advantages might be derived from it. Two of his works show him to be an originator. In 1719 he published "L'Antiquit&eacute; expliqu&eacute;e et repr&eacute;sent&eacute;e en figures" (10 vols., folio, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>), in which he reproduces, methodically grouped, all the ancient monuments that might be of use in the study of the religion, domestic customs, material life, military institutions, and funeral rites of the ancients. Of this work, which contains 1120 plates, the whole edition of 1800 copies was exhausted in two months, in spite of its enormous size. The regent, Philippe d'Orl&eacute;ans, desired that the author should become a member of the Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and he was elected to replace Pere Letellier (1719). Montfaucon then conceived a more daring <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, a work, similar to "l'Antiquit&eacute; expliqu&eacute;e", which should embrace the entire history on <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. This work, the "Monuments de la monarchie fran&ccedil;aise", dedicated to Louis XV, appeared from 1729 to 1733 (5 vols., folio, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>). In it Montfaucon studies the history, as it is shown in the monuments, of each successive reign down to that of Henry IV. His reproductions are inexact, and the work remained incomplete. In 19 December, 1741, he read before the Academy of Inscriptions a plan for completing this work; two days later he passed away tranquilly, without any premonitory symptoms of illness. An indefatigable scholar, a bold thinker, an originator of scientific methods, he left after him a mighty generation of disciples to form the connecting link between the old <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> learning and modern scholarship.
