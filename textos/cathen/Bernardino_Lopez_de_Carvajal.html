<h1>Bernardino Lopez de Carvajal</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, b. 1455, at <a href="../cathen/12157a.htm">Plasencia</a> in Estremadura, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 16 Dec., 1523. He was a nephew of the famous <a href="../cathen/03393c.htm">Cardinal Juan Carvajal</a>, and owing to the universal esteem for the latter advanced rapidly in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither he came during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> (1471-84). Under <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> he held successively the Spanish sees of <a href="../cathen/02018d.htm">Astorga</a> (1488), <a href="../cathen/02193a.htm">Badajoz</a> (1489), and Cartagena, in which latter quality he was sent as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and by their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Majesties sent back as Spanish ambassador to <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, by whom he was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Sts. Peter and Marcellinus in 1493, which title he exchanged in 1495 for that of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme. In the next following years he was sent twice as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the German imperial court, also to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and acted as Governor of the Campagna. In 1503 he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13788a.htm">Sig&uuml;enza</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Administrator of <a href="../cathen/02149c.htm">Avellino</a>; from 1507 to 1509 he was in turn <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>, <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>, <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a> and Santa Sabina. In spite of this rapid advancement and his numerous <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> he is best remembered as the leading spirit of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> (1511), which he organized with the aid of four other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> (Bri&ccedil;onnet, Francesco Borgia, <a href="../cathen/13453a.htm">Sanseverino</a>, and Ren&eacute; de Prie); dissatisfaction with this treatment by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, and subserviency to the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> French king, Louis XII, led Carvajal to this rebellious attitude. Moroni (Diz., X, 134) says that he went so far as to accept the office of <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> (Martin VI) at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> whither the Council was soon transferred. <a href="../cathen/12798b.htm">Von Reumont</a> says (gesch. d. Stadt Rom. III, ii 78-79) that in <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> he was known to the urchins of the street as "Papa Bernardino". It would seem, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was his chief falling; otherwise he was reputed a good <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and a friend of art and letters, virtuous, eloquent, and skilful in the business of the curia. Both Carvajal and his colleagues were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, and deposed from their offices, which act of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a> (1512). At the seventh session (1513) of this council the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, Carvajal and <a href="../cathen/13453a.htm">Sanseverino</a>, separated from their two French colleagues, formally renounced the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and were restored by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> to their offices. (Pastor, Gesch. d. P&auml;pste, Freiburg, 1906, IV (1), 37-40). Carvajal was later made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> and Dean of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, with his uncle's former title of San Marcello, and as such welcomed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a> (op. cit. IV (2) 47-48), whom he survived, and <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>. He had lived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under eight <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and was buried in his titular church of Santa Croce, where a magnificent sepulchral monument perpetuates his memory. The noble but modernized frescoes (<a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>) in the tribuna of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, representing the Discovery of the Holy Cross, are owing to his generosity. His natural gifts, inherited prestige, numerous <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, high offices, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of splendour, and great wealth attracted to him more than once the favourable attention of several <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a>, but at a critical period in his career he stood in his own light by fathering an ugly and perilous <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> on the very eve of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>.
