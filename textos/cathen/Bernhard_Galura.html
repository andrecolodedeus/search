<h1>Bernhard Galura</h1>  

<p>Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>; b. 21 August, 1764, at Herbolzheim, Bresigau; d. 17 May, 1856. After he had completed his classical studies in his native town he entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> at Altbreisach, but because of its suppression by <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>, his stay here was of short duration. In 1783 he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> where, after a brilliant course in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the doctorate of Theology. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1788 in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> whither he had gone to follow a course of practical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. In the same year he returned to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, and after acting as prefect of studies for two years he took up <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work, first at Altoberndorf and later in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>. Recognizing in him a man of learning and sound judgment, Emperoro Francis appointed him in 1805 spiritual referee at Gunzburg, but owing to political changes he lost his position here, and ten years later was assigned to the same <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>. In 1819 he became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Vorarlberg. On 30 January, 1820, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, and nine years later took formal possession of the chair of St. Cassian as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>.

<p>Like his distinguished predecessors, Galura directed all his efforts towards safeguarding the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. By the establishment of missions and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> and by the introduction of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, especially the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (who had been banished from there) and the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> (in 1838), he succeeded in restoring much of what the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> had destroyed during the administration of his predecessor. He was highly respected by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>, and his deeply religious spirit, his charity towards the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and his administrative abilities have made him an ornament to his church and country. Besides numerous <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a>, homiletical, and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> works, he wrote also: (1) "Christkatholische Religion" (5 vols., Augsburg, 1796-1800); (3) "Lehrbuch der Christlichen Wohlgezogenheit" (Augsburg, 1841).
