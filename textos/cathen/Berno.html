<h1>Berno</h1>  

<p>(Apostle of the Obotrites), in the latter half of the twelfth century. The Obotrites were one of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> tribes known under the common name of Wends, and dwelt along the Baltic in <a href="../cathen/10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a>. Three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> had been erected in their country as early as the tenth century, Oldenburg (transferred to Lubeck in the twelfth century), <a href="../cathen/16070a.htm">Ratzeburg</a>, and Mecklenburg, but they remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> during the greater part of the eleventh century. Duke Henry the Lion, of Saxony, having partly subdued the Obotrites, re-established the three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, and in 1155 selected Berno as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a>. He was a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the flourishing <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Amelungsborn on the Weser, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Pope Adrian IV</a>. As these sees were not only episcopal residences but also political centres and strongholds of foreign power, the Obotrites identified the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> with the German name and detested both. No wonder that Berno at first met with small success in his missionary labours. The Obotrite Prince Niklot, the fiercest enemy both of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, had not yet submitted to German ascendancy and was the greatest obstacle to the conversion of the people. Berno was even <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> in 1158 to transfer his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> from <a href="../cathen/10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a> to Schwerin, whither German colonists had already penetrated. From Schwerin as a centre, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and intrepid missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> began his work of preaching, destroying idols, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, and building churches, and penetrated as far as Demmin in hither <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>. Here, in 1163, he converted the powerful Prince Pribislav, son of Niklot, who, however, fell away again the very next year, made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, and attacked, and nearly killed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the altar. In the end he had to acknowledge the German supremacy and remained henceforth loyal to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>.

<p>In 1168 Berno undertook a missionary expedition to the island of Rugen and destroyed the temple and the great idol of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> inhabitants, whom by patience and kindness he won over to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. In the year 1171 he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Schwerin, where in 1177, he held the first synod. The greatest service which this apostolic man rendered to those countries was the introduction of his religious brethren, the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Doberan, which through the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> efforts was founded by Pribislav in 1171, soon became a centre from which radiated <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization far and wide. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had been brought from his own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Amelungsborn. Two years later Dargun was founded and entrusted to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, however, did not flourish until the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were replaced by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Doberan. During the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> caused by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, Berno, like all the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, never wavered in his loyalty to the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, though his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, had joined the cause of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. When at last Frederick made his peace with <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, Berno was enabled to make a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1178) to pay his homage to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who confirmed the erection of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> of the following year he took part in the General Council of the Lateran. During his absence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the Wends had risen against the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Doberan had been destroyed and its seventy-eight inmates massacred. When peace was re-established Doberan was rebuilt and again peopled by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Amelungsborn in 1186. Berno died in 1191 (1190?) having laboured as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Mecklenburg for over thirty years.
