<h1>Bertha</h1>  

<p>Of the various <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> bearing the name of Bertha, five are more particularly worthy of notice.
<h2 id="section1">Bertha, Queen of Kent</h2>

<p>Died c. 612. She was a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> princess, daughter of Charibert and the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Ingoberga. In marrying the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> King Ethelbert of Kent, she brought her <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> Liudhard with her, and restored a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church in <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, which dated form the Roman occupation, dedicating it to St. Martin. The present St. Martin's at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> occupies the same site. <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, who was sent by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> to preach the Gospel in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 596, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> owed much of his favourable reception to the influence of Bertha. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> in 601 addressed to her a letter of thanks, which is still preserved. It is printed in Haddan and Stubbs, III, 17. Ethelbert himself was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> on <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Whitsunday</a> in 597, and Canterbury became the mother-church of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Bertha was sometimes styled "Saint", but there is no clear evidence of cultus. (See, on this point, the poems of Reginald of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> in the "Neues Archiv", xiii.) Fuller accounts of Bertha will be found in <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a>, "Anglo-Saxon Church;" "Dict. Nat. Biog.", Plummer, "Bede", and Routledge, "Church of St. Martin".
<h2 id="section2">St. Bertha (virgin and martyr)</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Val d'Or, near Avenay, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, d. about 690. She was wife of St. Gumbert, Lord of Champenois, a nobleman of royal blood. He built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> for his wife and her maidens at Avenay, and retired himself to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the coast, where he was soon afterwards <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> marauders. When the people of Avenay suffered form lack of water, St. Peter appeared to Bertha and showed her a field where there was a good spring. This she bought for a pound of silver. It became a holy well which cured diseases and supplied both her own <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and the hamlet of Avenay with water. Bertha was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by Gumbert's relatives, who were indignant at the distribution of his money to the poor. Whether the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> founded at Avenay followed the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> or the Columban Rule, does not seem certain even to <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>. The whole legend in fact is very late and unreliable. St. Bertha's feast is on the 1st of May. (See Acta SS. for that day.)
<h2 id="section3">St. Bertha (abbess of Blangy in Artois)</h2>

<p>Died about 725. She was the daughter of Rigobert, Count of the Palace under Clovis II, and married Siegfried, a relation of the king. After twenty years, when he died, she determined to found a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a>. Two buildings which she constructed fell down, but an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in a vision guided her to another spot, and there after many difficulties a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> was built, which she entered with her two elder daughters, Deotila and Gertrude. A still later legend represents this Gertrude as much <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the attentions of a great noble, Roger, who wished to marry her by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, but she was saved from his <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> by her mother's firm <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Some time before her death Bertha is said to have resigned her office of <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> and to have shut herself up in a little cell built against the church wall. But the whole story of Bertha, as <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> agree, is of very late date and historically worthless. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on the 4th of July. (See Acta SS. for that day, and D&eacute;cobert, "Ste. Berthe et son Abbaye de Blangy", Lille, 1892).
<h2 id="section4">Blessed Bertha de Bardi (abbess)</h2>

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> uncertain; died 24 March, 1163. She was the daughter of Lothario di Ugo, Count of Vernio, and is ordinarily called Bertha de Bardi, but the name should probably be d'Alberti. She joined the order of Vallombrosa, a branch of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, but she was soon sent to govern and reform a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the order at Cavriglia in Valdarno, where she lived famous for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> until her death. (See Acta SS. for that day, and Soldani, "Vita di S. Berta", <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1731.)
<h2 id="section5">Blessed Bertha de Marbais</h2>

<p>Died 1247. She was a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, who became the first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> which was founded by Jane, Countess of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, in 1127 at Marquette or Marchet, near Lille. She died on 18 July, and is briefly noticed on that day in the Acta SS. Bertha is called Blessed by the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> chronicler, Henriquez, but the evidence of cultus is very slight.
