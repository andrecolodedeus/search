<h1>Berthold</h1>  

<p>Bishop, Apostle of the Livonians, killed 24 July, 1198, in a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Livonians who threatened destruction to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that lived in their territory. He was previously <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Lockum in <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>. At the death of Meinhard, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Livonia (c. 1196), Archbishop Hartwig of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, to whose province belonged the newly converted countries along the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea, appointed Abbot Berthold successor. It seems very probable that, as <a href="../cathen/04614b.htm">Damberger</a> asserts in his "Synchronistische Geschichte der Kirche und der Welt im Mittelalter", when Meinhard came to Bremen in 1186 to obtain help in his apostolic labours in Livonia, Berthold joined the band of missionaries who accompanied him thither. On this assumption, Berthold had been working ten years as a missionary among the Livonians when he became their second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and was, therefore, well acquainted with his field of labour.

<p>The Livonian <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> were fanatically opposed to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Berthold's predecessor, assisted by merchants from <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> and L&uuml;beck and a few converted natives, had built fortifications along the River D&uuml;na, where <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> held their religious services and could protect themselves against the fury of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. Following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Berthold tried to gain their confidence and good will by kindness. At first they appeared to become less hostile, but soon their old <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> revived. When Berthold attempted to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cemetery at Holm, their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> fanaticism broke loose in all its fury and they decided either to burn the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> together with his church at Holm or to drown him in the D&uuml;na. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> fled to their strongholds at Uxk&uuml;ll and Holm, while the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> escaped in a ship to L&uuml;beck.

<p><a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Pope Celestine III</a>, shortly before his death, was preparing to send a fleet of <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> to protect the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the Baltic Provinces, and his successor, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, continued the work. Berthold gained the financial assistance of Archbishop Hartwig and many merchants of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> and L&uuml;beck. In a short time a large fleet was ready for departure well equipped and loaded with <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> and many German peasants who were to settle permanently in Livonia. It put to sea at Lbeck and crossed the Baltic, entering the River Dna from what is now called the Gulf of Riga. Near the mouth of the Dna the German peasants landed with the purpose of making their homes in the vicinity, and laid the foundations of the city Riga, at present one of the most important commercial seaports in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Berthold, accompanied by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, sailed up the river as far as Holm, where the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Livonians had gathered with the intention of attacking the fleet. Having vainly attempted to come to a peaceful agreement with them, Berthold and his companions sailed some distance down the river, with the Livonians in eager pursuit. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> agreed to a suspension of hostilities to gain time for collecting larger forces. At the first opportunity, however, they fell upon the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who ventured outside their fortifications, and hostilities were resumed. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> were victorious, but Berthold's horse became intractable and galloped into the midst of the fleeing Livonians. A <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> by the name of Ymant thrust his lance into Berthold's back, inflicting a wound that caused speedy death. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> body was buried by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> at Uxkll whence it was transferred to Riga by Bishop Albert of Apeldern whom Archbishop Hartwig of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> had appointed Berthold's successor. Soon after the death of Berthold many of the vanquished <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> came to the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, expressing their regret at the unhappy occurrence and asked to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The final conversion of Livonia was effected by Bishop Albert, who was assisted in his apostolic labours by the newly founded Order of the Brothers of the Sword which in 1237 was affiliated with the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>.
