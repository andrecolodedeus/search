<h1>Berthold of Chiemsee</h1>  

<p>A German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writer, b. 1465 at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; d. 19 July, 1543, at Saalfelden (duchy of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>). His real name was Berthold P&uuml;rstinger, frequently called Pirstinger; but he is generally known as Berthold of Chiemsee, from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, situated on one of the islands of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> lake of Chiemsee. We have but little information regarding his early life. He was licentiate in civil, and doctor in ecclesiastical law, and in 1495 he appears as the <em>Magister Camer&aelig;</em> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, and in 1508 was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chiemsee. During his episcopal career (1508-25), he resided at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, in the quality of coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the latter place.

<p>Berthold twice conspicuously used his influence with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> in behalf of the unfortunate: in 1511 in favour of the Salzburg town-councillors who had been condemned for high treason, and again in 1524 in the interest of the rebellious peasants. He was present at the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> (1512), and also took an active part in 1522 in that of M&uuml;hldorf (Bavaria), which was convened to devise means of stemming the tide of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> progress. Soon after, he resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> (1526) and retired to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Raitenhaslach on the Austro-Bavarian frontier. In 1528, or 1529, he removed to Saalfelden, where he founded (1533) a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> with a church for infirm <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He died there and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church.

<p>After his resignation of his episcopal functions Berthold devoted his time to literary pursuits. At the suggestion of Matthew Lang, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, (1519-40), he wrote his "Tewtsche Theologey" (German Theology &mdash; Munich, 1528) and translated it afterwards into Latin Augsburg, 1531). Earnestness in the suppression of abuses and mildness in his dealings with others were characteristic traits of Berthold, and they appear also in his works; his "Theology" does not bear the bitterly polemical stamp of similar contemporaneous writings. The work does not seem to have been in great demand, as neither the original nor the translation was reprinted until Reithmeier re-edited the work (1852). The book, however, was important. The German original is valuable from both a linguistic and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> point of view. Linguistically, it proves that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> was not the only able exponent of religious doctrines in the vernacular; theologically, it exhibits the character of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> at the time.

<p>The other writings of Berthold were: (1) "Tewtsch Rational", a treatise on the Mass; (2) "Keligpuchel", a defence of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and practice of Communion under one kind, against the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>; (3) "Onus Ecclesi&aelig;" or "Burden of the Church" (Landshut, 1524) is also generally attributed to him. It is a fearless exposition, from a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> point of view, of the abuses then prevalent in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The book occasioned much comment and was reprinted twice in 1531, at Cologne and probably at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and again in 1620 without indication of place.
