<h1>Besan&ccedil;on (Vesontio)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> coextensive with the departments of Doubs, Haute-Sa&ocirc;ne, and the district of Belfort. Few nineteenth-century <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> have undergone similar territorial changes. The Concordat of 1802 gave the Diocese of Besan&ccedil;on all those districts which, in 1822, constituted the Diocese of St. -Claude. In 1806, Besan&ccedil;on was given <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the three <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the principality of Neufachatel (Switzerland) which fell under the control of the See of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> in 1814. In 1870, after the annexation of <a href="../cathen/01341c.htm">Alsace-Lorraine</a> by <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the district of Belfort was withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">See of Strasburg</a> and attached to that of Besan&ccedil;on. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Besan&ccedil;on also underwent singular changes. In 1802 its suffragans were the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>. Under the Restoration, <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> and Autun were withdrawn from Besan&ccedil;on, the latter becoming the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the Sees of <a href="../cathen/13344b.htm">Saint-Di&eacute;</a>, <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Belley</a>. In 1874, after the German conquest, the churches of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and Strasburg were under the direct control of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>Local legends attribute the evangelization of Besan&ccedil;on to Sts. Ferr&eacute;ol and Ferjeux, sent thither by St. Iren&aelig;us, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. Duchesne has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that these legends belong to a chain of narratives forged in the first half of the sixth century and of which the "passion" of <a href="../cathen/02479c.htm">St. Benignus of Dijon</a> was the initial link. The catalogue of the earliest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Besan&ccedil;on is to be read with caution. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> known to history is Celidonius (c. 445); other incumbents of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were St. Rothadius, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at <a href="../cathen/09467a.htm">Luxeuil</a> and organizer of the monastic life; St. Donatus; <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> I (1031-67), prince of the empire, the real founder of the city whose markets, commerce, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> he established; <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Cardinal de Granvelle</a> (1584-86), the famous minister of Philip II, who built the palace of Besan&ccedil;on; Antoine-Pierre de Grammont (1662-98), who strenuously opposed <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, strove to uplift the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and, in 1691, transferred to Besan&ccedil;on the University of D&ocirc;le; Le Coz (1802-15), former constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whose <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> provoked in the diocese no little opposition to the Concordat; Cardinal de Rohan-Chabot (1828-33); <a href="../cathen/10048a.htm">Cardinal Mathieu</a> (1834-75), who distinguished himself by his defence of the temporal power, and was a member of the "Opposition" at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican council</a>. He opposed strenuously in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the "simultaneous churches" which sprang up throughout the district of Montb&eacute;liard where <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> are numerous.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09467a.htm">Luxeuil</a>, founded by St. Columbanus (d. 615), gave to the Diocese of Besan&ccedil;on a series of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. First came the direct successors of St. Columbanus; the Abbot St. Eustasius who founded a celebrated <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; the Abbot St. Valbert who sent <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to found the Abbeys of St. -Val&eacute;ry, St. -Omer, and St. -Bertin, and died in 665; the Abbot St. Ingofroid; St. Donatus, who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Besan&ccedil;on; and <a href="../cathen/01545c.htm">St. Ansegisus</a>, author of a celebrated collection of capitularies. The Abbey of Lure was founded at the beginning of the seventh century by St. D&eacute;icole (Deicolus), or Desle, disciple of St. Columbanus; later its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were princes of the Holy Empire. The Abbey of Baume les Dames, founded in the fifth century and in which Gontran, King of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, was buried, was the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> where St. Odo, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, studied in the tenth century; at the end of the eighth century there was built near it an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> for <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, members of the nobility. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, the superb church of this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was laid waste. Among the other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the Diocese of Besan&ccedil;on may be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> St. Aldegrin (tenth century), and <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a> (1565-1640), one of those who, in the seventeenth century, inaugurated systematic <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for girls. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> visited Besan&ccedil;on, among them <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the altar of the old Cathedral of St. Etienne in 1050, and Eugenius III, who, in 1148, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Jean, the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. A council was held at Besan&ccedil;on in 1162, presided over by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, in the interest of the <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Antipope Victor</a> against <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a>. Guido of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> who was <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from 1119 to 1123 under the name of <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Calixtus II</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Nonnotte (1711-93) an adversary of Voltaire, were natives of Besan&ccedil;on. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> wrought through the Sacred Host of Faverney, during a fire in the year 1608, is annually commemorated by elaborate ceremonies. The places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: Notre Dame du Ch&ecirc;ne at Scey; Notre Dame d'Aigremont; the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of St. Pierre of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a> at Cirey-les-Bellevaux, where St. Pierre de Tarentaise died in 1174; Notre Dame des Jacobins at Besan&ccedil;on; and Notre Dame de la Motte at Vesoul. Parts of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Jean at Besan&ccedil;on were erected as early as the eleventh century.

<p>In 1899 the following institutions were to be found in the diocese: 15 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in Besan&ccedil;on and 35 in Vesoul; 1 deaf-mute institute in Besan&ccedil;on; 3 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> in Besan&ccedil;on and 3 in Vesoul; 2 protectories in Besan&ccedil;on; 1 house of correction in Besan&ccedil;on and 1 in Vesoul; 2 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and hospices in Besan&ccedil;on and 8 in Vesoul; 12 communities for the care of the sick in their homes in Besan&ccedil;on and 8 in Vesoul; 1 house of retreat in Besan&ccedil;on and 1 in Vesoul; 3 homes for the aged in Besan&ccedil;on; 1 <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylum</a>, 1 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, and 4 gratuitous industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in Vesoul, all conducted by <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; 1 deaf-mute institute and 1 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> in Besan&ccedil;on conducted by brothers.

<p>In 1900 the diocese had the following <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, <em>Men</em>: <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudists</a>, and Marianists at Besan&ccedil;on, and <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> at Notre Dame de la Grace de Dieu. <em>Women</em> (purely local orders): Sisters of Charity of Besan&ccedil;on, nursing and teaching, founded in 1799; Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> of Frasne-le-Chateau, teaching, founded in 1780; the Daughters of St. James, nursing sisters with a mother-house at Besan&ccedil;on. At the close of 1905 the Archdiocese of Besan&ccedil;on had 657,773 inhabitants, 60 pastorates, 814 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (mission churches), and 97 curacies.
