<h1>Bethlehem</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of Palestine. The early name of the city was Ephrata; afterwards Bethlehem, "House of Bread"; today Beith-Lahm, "House of Flesh." There died Rachel, Jacob's wife (<a href="../bible/gen035.htm#vrs19">Genesis 35:19</a>); <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was born there (<a href="../bible/1sa017.htm#vrs12">1 Samuel 17:12</a>), and many other Biblical personages. There was enacted the gracious idyll of Ruth and Booz. There, above all, the Savior was born, a descendant of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and from this fact the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> village has acquired unparalleled glory. It was at Bethlehem, also, that in the fourth century <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">St. Paula</a>, and St. Eustochium fixed their residence. According to John Cassian, it was in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bethlehem that the office of <a href="../cathen/12424a.htm">Prime</a> was instituted. As early as the second century it was indicated by <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin Martyr</a>, a native of Neapolis (Nablous), as the place of the Nativity. About A.D. 330 <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> built a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> on this site. The present church appears to date from a later time &#151; either the fifth or the sixth century &#151; and has been repaired at still later periods. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kings were wont to come from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at Bethlehem, in memory of the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> by Samuel. The greater part of the church is now shared by various communions, while the choir belongs to the Greeks alone, the Grotto of the Nativity is open to the Latins, the Greeks, and the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, who hold services there each in turn.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bethlehem, Arnolfo (1099-1103), was appointed by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was not canonically erected until 1109, when the title was united with that of <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, till then a Greek diocese (Revue de l'Orient latin, I, 141). The Diocese of Bethlehem-Ascalon existed from 1109-1378, but since the middle of the thirteenth century its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> resided at Clamecy in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Diocese of Bethlehem-Clamecy was created in 1378, and suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat</a> between <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, in 1801. The titular <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of Bethlehem and Ascalon, however, had existed separately from 1378 to 1603, when they were suppressed. From 1801 to 1840 both residential and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular sees</a>, either of Bethlehem or Ascalon, were extinct. In 1840, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> reunited the title of Bethlehem <em>in perpetuum </em>to the independent Abbey of <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> d'Agaune in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. In 1867 the titular See of <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a> was also re-established.

<p>Bethlehem is today a little town with about 10,000 inhabitants, exclusive of foreigners (5,000 Latins, 100 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a>, Greeks, 4,000 Greeks, a few <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>). The inhabitants are very active and industrious. Besides agriculture, they are engaged in the fabrication of wooden, mother-of-pearl, and bituminous limestone objects, such as beads, crosses, etc. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are remarkably beautiful and wear a peculiar costume which is very rich and of ancient pattern The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> govern the Latin <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, a scholasticate, a primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and an asylum; the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for native young men; the Fathers of the Sacred Heart, or Betharramites, have a scholasticate for their missions in South America; the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a> conduct an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> and an elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of the Apparition have two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, and an infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; the Sisters of Charity have a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> lately established has not yet a church. There are also Greek and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> conducted by Greeks, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.
