<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Bethlehem</h1>  

<p>The old Hebrew name <em>b&ecirc;th lehem</em>, meaning "house of bread", has survived till the present day. In its Arabic form, however, <em>b&ecirc;t lahm, </em>it means "house of meat". Several scholars (Smith, Hist. Geog. of the Holy Land, 1906, 318. n. 2) hold that the name is connected with Lakhmu, one of the divinities in the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Creation myth and that Bethlehem was a sacred shrine of that god in ancient times. This is possible, but there is no actual evidence in favor of the conjecture. Two cities of the name are known from <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>: <em>Bethlehem</em> and <em>Bethlehem of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</em>
<h2>Bethlehem</h2>

<p>Bethlehem is mentioned in <a href="../bible/jos019.htm#vrs15">Joshua 19:15</a>, as one of the twelve cities belonging to the tribe of <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a>. It is but a small town, poorly built, and of no great importance (Buhl, Geog. des alten Pal&auml;stina, 1896, 215), a little less than seven miles southwest of Sapphoris (Saffurieh) and seven miles northwest of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, the home of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. Critics do not agree among themselves whether the Bethlehem described in Judges, xii, 8, 10, as the home of Abesan (Ibzan), one of the minor judges, is the same as that of <a href="../bible/jos019.htm#vrs15">Joshua 19:15</a>, or Bethlehem of Juda. A large number if not the majority of modern commentators are in favor of Bethlehem of <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a>. But ancient tradition (Josephus, Antiq., V, vii, 13; cf. also Moore, Judges, Int. Crit. Com.) made Abesan spring from Bethlehem of Juda and the view is ably defended by Father Lagrange in his commentary (Smith, op cit.; Hogg, Encyc. Bib., IV, 5389). In any case the importance of that city was never great. But the efforts of some modern critics have made it more famous. Unable to accept as historical the narratives of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> birth in Bethlehem of Juda, these scholars would place the Nativity in Bethlehem of <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a>, referred to in the Talmud (Megilla, 70, a) as Bethlehem <em>seriyyah</em>, which is regarded as equivalent to <em>noseryyah</em>, i.e. Bethlehem of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> (of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>), a certainly remarkable combination of two names so well known from the Gospels (R&eacute;ville, J&eacute;sus de Nazareth, 2nd ed., Paris, 1906, I, 360).
<h2>Bethlehem of Judea</h2>

<p>"Bethlehem of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>" [so the Greek text of <a href="../bible/mat002.htm#vrs1">Matthew 2:1</a>, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> corrected by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> to Bethlehem of Juda, thinking that the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> had in his original text conformed to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> usage (<a href="../bible/jdg017.htm#vrs7">Judges 17:7</a>, <a href="../bible/jdg019.htm">19:1</a>; <a href="../bible/1sa017.htm#vrs12">1 Samuel 17:12</a>)], is much more celebrated than its northern namesake as the birthplace of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, and above all, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. The city, which numbers now [1907] about 10,000 inhabitants, almost exclusively <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, is situated five miles south of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at a very short distance from the highroad from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, in the midst of a most beautiful country (Buhl, op. cit., 19), which contrasts favorably with the neighborhood of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. At an altitude of 2,350 feet it spreads out between Wadi el Hrobbe in the North and the Wadi er-Rahib in the south; the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> is visible in the southeast, a detail to be remembered in reading the beautiful story of <a href="../cathen/13276a.htm">Ruth the Moabitess</a>, the scene of which is Bethlehem (Smith, op. cit.). The main resources of Bethlehem are agriculture and the sale of religious articles; the city is also the market place of the peasants and Bedouins of the neighborhood.

<p>According to <a href="../bible/gen035.htm#vrs16">Genesis 35:16-19</a> and <a href="../bible/gen048.htm#vrs7">48:7</a>, Bethlehem was associated with the patriarchal history. The sepulchre of <a href="../cathen/12630a.htm">Rachel</a>, or Qubbet R&agrave;hil (Rachel's <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a>) as it is called now, about one mile north of Bethlehem, still shown to the pilgrim and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, is referred to again in <a href="../bible/1sa010.htm#vrs2">1 Samuel 10:2</a>, and <a href="../bible/mat002.htm#vrs16">Matthew 2:16-18</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/jer031.htm#vrs15">Jeremiah 31:15</a>. As an examination of these passages shows, the tradition presents some obscurities, and critics question the correctness of the gloss (<a href="../bible/gen035.htm#vrs19">Genesis 35:19</a>) which identifies Ephrata with Bethlehem, supposing it the result of a confusion between Bethlehem-Ephrata [Ruth, iv, 11; Mich., v, 2 (1)], i.e. our Bethlehem, and another Ephrata in the north, otherwise unknown, or assume two different traditions regarding Rachel's sepulchre. (Cf. commentaries: Driver in Hast., "Dict. of the Bible", IV, 193, a; Buhl, op. cit., 156, 159; B&auml;deker-Benzinger, "Pal&auml;stina und Syrien", 1904, 91.) Bethlehem is mentioned also in Judges as the home of the young <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a> who went to Michas (xvii, 7f.) and of the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (xix, 1f.) whose death caused the expedition against the tribe of Benjamin. In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, however, it is connected especially with the great <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a> (<a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#vrs1">1 Samuel 16:1</a> and <em>passim</em>), whose name is given to the three cisterns (Bi' Da'ud), found northwest of the town, not far from the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Rachel. A tradition not older than the end of the fifteenth century, according to B&auml;deker-Benzinger (p. 91), sees therein the cistern referred to in <a href="../bible/2sa023.htm#vrs14">2 Samuel 23:14f.</a> and <a href="../bible/1ch011.htm#vrs16">1 Chronicles 11:16f.</a> Later the city was fortified by Roboam (<a href="../bible/2ch011.htm#vrs6">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>), and <a href="../bible/ezr002.htm#vrs21">Ezra 2:21f.</a> [cf. <a href="../bible/neh007.htm#vrs26">Nehemiah 7:26</a>] informs us of the return of 123 <a href="../cathen/02534b.htm">Bethlehemites</a> from the Captivity.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, we have, with the exception of <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#vrs42">John 7:42</a>, references to Bethlehem only in <a href="../bible/mat002.htm">Matthew 2</a> and <a href="../bible/luk002.htm">Luke 2</a>, whose narratives of the birth of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Savior</a> in the city of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> have rendered it most dear to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Many modern critics, however, are making Bethlehem again "little among the thousands of Judah" (Schmidt, <em>The Prophet of Nazareth</em>, 1905, 246) by attacking the historical value of the Gospel narratives. Some place <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> birth at <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, called His <em>patris</em>in the Gospels (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs1">Mark 6:1</a>, and parallels; cf. <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs9">1:9</a>; <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs24">1:24</a>, etc.); this is done by almost all those who deny the historicity of the Infancy, endeavoring to explain our narratives as a legend arisen from the Jewish tradition that the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> had to be born in <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, occasioned by Micheas, v, 2 (1). (Cf. Targum; also <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#vrs42">John 7:42</a>; Strauss, Life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, tr. Eliot, from the 4th Germ. edit., 1840, sect. 32, end, sect. 39; Usener in "Encyc. Bib.", III 3346-47; Schmidt, op. cit., 243, 246; Weiss in "Die Schriften des N. T.", G&ouml;ttingen, 1906, I, 1, pp. 46, 221-223, 393-395.) Others more seldom give the explanation already mentioned.

<p>This question, which is part of the larger problems connected with <a href="../bible/mat001.htm">Matthew 1</a>-<a href="../bible/mat002.htm">2</a> and <a href="../bible/luk001.htm">Luke 1</a>-<a href="../bible/luk002.htm">2</a>, cannot be discussed here. [See besides the lives of Jesus and commentaries; Ramsay, "Was Christ born at Bethlehem?", 1898.] Suffice it to remark here that if the second explanation removes some difficulties, it requires us to go entirely behind the narratives of both Matthew and Luke, who most clearly mean only Bethlehem of Juda (see Knowling "Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels", New York, 1906, I, 204). Against the first explanation it may be noted with many critics that Matthew and Luke agree independently in placing the birth at Bethlehem without, in St. Luke's case, any sign of influence of Micheas' prophecy (Knowling, op. cit.; Nichol, "Dictionary of Christ", I, 195, a; Jacquier "Hist. des livres du N. T.", Paris, 1905, II, 209). We must not, however, exaggerate the value of that argument. (Cf. Revue d'histoire et de litt&eacute;rature religieuses, Jan.-Feb., 1906, 62f.) These difficulties were unknown to the ancient writers, who reproduce simply the Gospel narratives with additions, in some cases possibly historical. About 150 we find <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin Martyr</a> referring (<a href="../fathers/01286.htm"><em>Dialogue with Trypho</em> 78</a>) to the Savior's birth as having taken place in a cave near the village of Bethlehem; such cave stables are not rare in Palestine. (Cf. Massie in Hast., Dict. of the Bible, III, 234; Expository Times, May, 1903, 384; Bonaccorsi, "Il Natale", Rome, 1903, 16-20.) The tradition of the birth in a cave was widely accepted, as we see from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> words about a century later: "In Bethlehem the cave is pointed out where He was born, and the manger in the cave where He was wrapped in swaddling clothes, and the rumor is in those places and among foreigners of the Faith that indeed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born in this cave". (<a href="../fathers/04161.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> I.51</a>) It is reproduced also in the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> gospels (Pseudo-Matt., xiii, ap. Bonaccorsi, op. cit., 159-163; Protevang. of James, xvii sqq., Bonaccorsi, 155-159; Gospel of the Infancy, II-IV, Bonaccorsi, 163-164). Over the traditional spot of the Nativity stands a church (St. Mary of the Nativity), surrounded on the northwest and southwest by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the Latins (Franciscans), Greeks, and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, respectively. The building is, apart from additions and modifications made by Justinian (527-565), substantially the work of Constantine (about 330). Underneath that most ancient and venerable monument of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, a favorite resort of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> throughout the centuries, is the grotto of the Nativity. The Nativity <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, running in the same general direction as the church (east to west), is situated under the choir; at the eastern end is a silver star with the inscription: <em>Hic de Virgine Maria Jesus Christus natus est</em> and near the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Crib (see Bonaccorsi, op. cit., 77-113). Other grottoes to the north and north-west connected with that of the Nativity are associated, mostly by recent traditions (c. fifteenth century), with the narratives of <a href="../bible/mat002.htm">Matthew 2</a>, mainly, and with the memory of the great scholar <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and his company of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned friends (Sanders, Etudes sur S. J&eacute;rome, Paris, 1903, 29f.).
