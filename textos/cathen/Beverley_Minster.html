<h1>Beverley Minster</h1>  

<p>A collegiate church at Beverley, capital of the East Riding of Yorkshire, served by a chapter of secular canons until the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The foundation owes its origin to <a href="../cathen/08469b.htm">St. John of Beverley</a> early in the eighth century, when the locality was a clearing in the forest of Deira (Indrawood), afterwards known as Beverlac (A.S. <em>Beoferlic</em>), a name possibly due to the colonies of beavers in the river Hull. St. John here founded a community of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and another of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, but traditions as to the existence of an earlier church are legendary and untrustworthy. Later the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, having resigned his See of York, retired here and died (721), his shrine being in the minster. After the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by the Danes, a chapter of secular canons was founded By King Athelstan in gratitude for his victory at Brunanburh (937), as he had visited the shrine on his march north. It remained a popular place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> throughout the vicissitudes of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> and Norman invasions. Few particulars about the early history of the church are known, but a fire in 1188 destroyed the greater part of it, and the present Gothic minster, rivalling the great <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> in beauty, dates from that time. The west front in particular is unsurpassed as a specimen of the Perpendicular style. The choir and double <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> were built early in the thirteenth century; while the present <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> replaced the Norman <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> a century later. Throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the shrine was frequented by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, and the charters of its liberties were renewed by successive monarchs. Its banner was placed on the standard at the "battle of the Standard" (1138), and it was further <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> after the victory of Agincourt, which was won on the feast of the translation of St. John (25 October, 1415), and was attributed by Henry V to that saint's intercession (Lyndwode, "Provinciale", II, "Anglicanae"). The minster was originally served by a chancellor, <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a>, <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacrist</a>, nine canons, nine vicars-choral and seven <em>berefellarii</em> or clerks, but in time several <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and minor officials were added. The temporalities were administered by a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, who was not necessarily a member of the chapter. The former office was held by many noted Englishmen, including <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas Becket</a> and John de Thoresby, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>. <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Blessed John Fisher</a> is believed to have received his first <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> attached to the minster. The chapter being secular, the minster escaped the <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">ruin that fell on the monasteries</a> under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, but was dissolved in 1547 under the "Colleges and Chantries Act" of Edward VI. The seventy-seven collegiate officers thus dispossessed were replaced by a vicar and three assistants reduced, under Elizabeth, to a vicar and one <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a>. Gradually the minster fell into decay until, in 1713, a restoration became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to save it from ruin. This was successfully executed, and as a result of further work in 1866 and subsequent years it still remains one of the most remarkable <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
