<h1>Bible Societies</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Bible Societies, established for the purpose of publishing and propagating the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in all parts of the world, are the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> outcome of the principle: "The <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> alone is the religion of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>." Precisely to what extent that <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> formula is held <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> even by the stanchest evangelicals, may be a matter of dispute, but the consistent and heroic efforts of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> to provide a version of the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a> in every tongue and to supply the ends of the earth with <a href="../bible/index.html">Bibles</a>, can scarcely be explained unless Chillingworth's famous formula be taken to mean literally that the possession of a copy of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> is an indispensable means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for the world-wide propagation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, are a late outgrowth of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. It is well known that the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> did not seriously bestir themselves about mission work until two hundred years after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and historically the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are an appendage and a consequence of the missionary organizations. Some efforts were made to provide a systematic dissemination of Bibles as early as the time of Charles I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and before the formation of Bible <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> on a scale of world-wide activity, there existed a number of organizations which made Bible distribution a feature of their work. Among them were, (1) The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (1698), which spread copies of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and Arabia; (2) The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> (1662); (3) The Society for Sending Missionaries to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, founded in 1705 by King Frederick of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>; (4) The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (1701), which devoted a large share of its attention to the American Colonies; (5) The Scottish Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge among the Poor (1750); (6) The Naval and Military Bible Society (1780). The foundation of these and similar <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> was but an indication of the vast work that was to come. The great reaction against the religious apathy, and, indeed, infidelity of the English people in the eighteenth century brought with it the foundation of numerous missionary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and this new enthusiasm for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> resulted in the foundation of the most famous and the most effective of all Bible <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, The British and Foreign Bible Society, 7 March, 1804. The first impulse to the formation of this organization was given by a group of <a href="../cathen/11095b.htm">Nonconformist</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, but when completely formed, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> included an equal number of members of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Established Church</a> and of the various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. Its avowed purpose was "to encourage the wider circulation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> without note or comment".

<p>At present, the British and Foreign Society is governed by an executive committee of 36 <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, 15 from the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, 15 dissenters, and 6 foreign members who must reside in or near London. The growth and work of this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> have been extraordinary. It controls, according to the latest statistics (1906) almost 8,000 auxiliary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>; 5,729 in Great Britain and 2,224 abroad. Its translations of the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a> number about 380. Its operations in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> have been particularly thorough, but in every country where its agencies are established, its work can only be measured in vast figures. It disposes annually of about 5,190,000 copies of the Scriptures (whole Bibles, New Testaments and other portions), and spends each year &#163;250,000 ($1,210,000). In the hundred years of its existence, this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has distributed 186,680,000, volumes at an expenditure of &#163;14,194,000 ($68,699,000). There have been numerous offshoots, some in the nature of developments, others <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>, but the size, wealth, and prestige of the parent <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> have always overshadowed those of its children and its rivals. Mention must also be made of the Hibernian Bible Society, and the National Bible Society of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, the names of which sufficiently designate their field of labour.

<p>On the Continent, Count Canstein founded a German Bible Society in 1710. Others were established at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> (1804), Berlin (1806), Saxony (1813), and Schleswick-Holstein (1826). The Berlin <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was united with the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Bible Society in 1814. The <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> Bible Society dates form 1814, the Russian from 1812; a Bible <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was founded in Finland in 1812, one in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> in 1815, and one in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> 1813, one in Malta in 1817, and one in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 1818.

<p>In America, we find the Continental Congress so impressed with the scarcity of Bibles that in 1777 it passed a resolution calling for the printing of 20,000 copies. Facilities were not at hand for the fulfillment of such a work, and it was not done. But in 1782, Congress commended the publication of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> which had just been made in Philadelphia. There had been local Bible <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in the Colonies, but these were not united with the American Bible Society until 1816. This <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has become next in size and in importance to its counterpart, the British and Foreign Bible Society and in 1907 controlled 620 auxiliary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and 11 agencies in the Latin-American countries and elsewhere. The Society has no established agency in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, but maintains correspondents in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, Russian Finland, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. In these countries it either co-operates with the National Bible <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, or lends assistance to the local <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches. For example, the American Bible Society has been co-operating closely for the last fifty years with the <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodist</a> Episcopal Church in <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and in that time and place has assisted in the publication of over a million volumes of Scripture. The American Society has extended its efforts into the Levant, a regular agency being established in Constantinople. It works in conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionaries in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the Sudan. In these countries alone, it has distributed over 3,000,000 volumes during the past half-century. All told, the copies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, or parts of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> distributed by the American Bible Society for one year, ending 31 March, 1906, were 2,236,755, and during the ninety years of its work it has disposed of 78,509,529 volumes.



<p>After being duly impressed by these figures and those of the still more prolific British Society, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reader naturally questions whether the amount of good done is, after all, to be measured by the number of volumes distributed. A considerable number of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionaries have already answered the question negatively, and if we may judge from many letters from <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> in the mission field, there is a growing feeling among thinking <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> that the promiscuous distribution of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> "without note or comment" is a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> means of propagating <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>. Even as a means of proselytism, the scattering of Bibles seems not to produce the expected results. A missionary on the Malay peninsula, among others, complains that although thousands of Bibles were distributed, it was, so far as he could learn, "with scarcely any perceptible benefit". He "did not hear of a single Malay convert on the whole peninsula". The natives of the missionary countries are, according to reports, eager to obtain books from the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, but agents and missionaries and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have reported that in many cases the volumes were used for vulgar and profane purposes. Indeed, the reckless distribution of the Scriptures in too many cases becomes an occasion for the profanation of the written Word, rather than for the growth of religion. Instances of abuse of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> could be collected freely from the letters of missionaries, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and non-Catholic alike.

<p>But for deeper reasons than this, the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> toward the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> is one of unmistakable opposition. Believing herself to be the divinely appointed custodian and interpreter of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, she cannot without turning traitor to herself, approve the distribution of Scripture "without note or comment". The fundamental fallacy of private interpretation of the Scriptures is presupposed by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. It is the impelling motive of their work. But it would be likewise the violation of one of the first principles of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> &mdash; a principle arrived at through observation as well as by revelation &mdash; the insufficiency of the Scriptures alone to convey to the general reader a sure <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, in its fourth session, after expressly condemning all interpretations of the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a> which contradict the past and present interpretations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, orders all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publishers to see to it that their editions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> have the approval of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Besides this and other regulations concerning Bible-reading in general, we have several acts of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> directed explicitly against the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. Perhaps the most notable of these are contained in the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Ubi Primum" of <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 5 May, 1824, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX's</a> <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Qui Pluribus", of 9 November, 1846. <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> in 1829 and <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> in 1844, spoke to similar effect. It may be well to give the most striking words on the subject form <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. To quote the former (loc. cit.): "You are aware, venerable brothers, that a certain Bible Society is impudently spreading throughout the world, which, despising the traditions of the holy Fathers and the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, is endeavouring to translate, or rather to pervert the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> into the vernacular of all nations. It is to be feared that by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation, the Gospel of Christ will become the gospel of men, or still worse, the gospel of the devil." The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then urges the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to admonish their flocks that owing to human temerity, more harm than good may come from indiscriminate Bible-reading. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> says (loc. cit.): "These crafty Bible Societies, which renew the ancient guile of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, cease not to thrust their Bibles upon all men, even the unlearned, &mdash; their Bibles, which have been translated against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and often contain <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> explanation of the text. Thus, the divine traditions, the teaching of the fathers, and the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are rejected, and everyone in his own way interprets the words of the Lord, and distorts their mean, thereby falling into miserable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>".

<p>Thus are given the chief reasons of the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Furthermore, it can scarcely be denied that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, by invading the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries and endeavouring to foist the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> versions upon a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people, have stirred up much discord, and have laid themselves open to the charge of degrading the Sacred Book by using it as an instrument of proselytism. Still in almost all the books and pamphlets which are written to show the results of Bible propagandism, na&iuml;ve complaints are made by the writers that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> forbid the dissemination of the Scriptures among their people. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> do not offer to supply <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Bibles, fortified with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Imprimatur, and supplied with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> notes of explanation. If such an offer were refused, there might be some pretext for the complaints of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, but so long as they follow their present course, it must be evident that they have small ground for wonder if the authorities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> oppose them. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> towards the popular use of the Scriptures is shown by the establishment of the Societa di San Geronimo, for the translation and diffusion of the Gospels and other parts of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> among the Italian peoples.

<p>There have been many dissensions and some <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> among the members of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> themselves. At the very foundation of the British and Foreign Bible Society Bishop Marsh, consistently with the principles of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, objected to the printing of the text, "without note or comment", and recommended the addition of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a>. The objection was, of course, overruled. In 1831, the British and Foreign Bible Society decided to demand <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Trinity as a requisite to membership. This led to a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and the foundation of the Trinitarian Bible Society. Another <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, originating from a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> difference, is the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> Translation Society, a body composed of <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a> who were dissatisfied because the original <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society's</a> Bibles did not translate the texts which relate to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by words that would signify immersion. Again, from the American Bible Society, there has been a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a>, originating, as in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, over the translation of <em>baptizein</em>. This dissident body, founded in 1837, is called The American and Foreign Bible Society. This organization in turn experienced a secession, the recalcitrants forming the American Bible Union, in 1850.
