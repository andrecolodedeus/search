<h1>Biblia Pauperum</h1>  

<p>(BIBLE OF THE POOR).

<p>A collection of pictures representing scenes from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> life with the corresponding prophetic types. The series commonly consists of forty or fifty pages. The page is divided into nine sections. The four corners are used for explanatory texts. The central pictures represent scenes from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> life, arranged chronologically. Above and below these are pictures of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and on each side are scenes from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. It is thus a concordance of the Old and the New Testaments in which is gathered together the common tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the types and figures of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, as taught by the liturgy and the Fathers. hence they were called sometimes "Figur&aelig; typic&aelig; Veritis Testamenti atque antitypic&aelig; Novi Testamenti" or "Historia Christi in Figuris". An interesting reproduction and description of a page on the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is given in Vigouroux, "Dictionnaire de la Bible", s.v.

<p>The invention of these picture-books is ascribed to St. Ansgar, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. This is stated in a note added to a copy at <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> there are remains of pictures, corresponding to this copy. The name, however, of "Biblia Pauperum" does not seem to have been primitive. It was added by a later hand to a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the Wolffenb&uuml;ttel <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> was thus catalogued, and the name became common. It is uncertain why they were so called. Perhaps it was because the ancient saying that pictures were the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, that is, of the uneducated. Some think that the name came from their use by the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> as books of instruction. Others suppose that the term means inexpensive; <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> had been beyond the means of most people; when the art of printing from engraved blocks was introduced these picture-books were among the first printed and gained a wide circulation. We have no definite information as to the purpose for which these books were intended. Probably it was for religious instruction; perhaps also to serve as models for artists. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that they exercised a great influence in spreading a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the mysteries of Faith, affording themes for preachers and artists. At Hirschau in Swabia, the entire series of pictures is reproduced in <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a>.

<p>Only a few <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copies of the "Biblia Pauperum" are extant; they come from the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">John van Eyck</a> 1366-1466). The blockbook, or xylographic process, appeared early in the fifteenth century, and Sotheby counts seven editions made from these wooden slabs. Only one side of the paper was printed, two sheets being pasted together to make a leaf. Five copies are in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale: four have forty plates; one copy is coloured by hand; the fifth has fifty plates. The first edition from moveable types was printed by Pfister at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> in 1462. The earlier editions have Latin texts; later they were printed in the vernacular. A German "Armenbibel" was published in 1470, and at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1503, A. V&eacute;rard published "Les Figures du Viel Testament et du Nouveau". In some of the printed editions the original arrangement of pictures and text was modified. In the latter half of the fifteenth century these books were very popular. As improved methods made it possible to issue the whole Bible with illustrations, the "Biblia" fell into disuse and disappeared. Several facsimile reproductions have appeared with historical and bibliographical introductions notably by Berjeau (1859); Camesina and Heider (Vienna, 1863); Unwin (London, 1884), with introduction by Dean Stanley; Einsle (Vienna, 1890); Laib and Schwarz (1892) and P. Heitz (1902).
