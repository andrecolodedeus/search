<h1>Biblical Criticism (Higher)</h1>  

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Biblical criticism in its fullest comprehension is the examination of the literary origins and historical values of the books composing the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, with the state in which these exist at the present day.

<p>Since the sacred Scriptures have come down in a great variety of copies and ancient versions, showing more or less divergence of text, it is the province of that department of Biblical criticism which is called <a href="../cathen/04497a.htm"><em>textual</em></a>, or <em>lower,</em> to study these documents with a view to arriving at the purest possible text of the sacred books. The name <em>higher criticism</em> was first employed by the German Biblical scholar Eichhorn, in the second edition of his "Einleitung", appearing in 1787. It is not, as supposed by some, an arrogant denomination, assuming superior wisdom, but it has come into use because this sort of criticism deals with the larger aspects of Bible study; viz., with the authorship, date, composition, and authority of whole books or large sections, as distinguished from the discussion of textual minuti&aelig;, which is the sphere of the lower, or textual, criticism. (See separate article <a href="../cathen/04497a.htm">TEXTUAL CRITICISM</a>).

<p>Taken in this limited sense, Biblical criticism, in the light of modern philological, historical, and arch&aelig;ological <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and by methods which are recent in their development, subjects to severe tests the previously accepted and traditional views on the human authorship, the time and manner of composition, of the sacred writings, and discriminates as to their objective historical value. In reaching its results it sets more store on evidences internal to the books than on external traditions or attestations, and its undeniable effect is to depreciate tradition in a great measure, so that there exists a sharply-drawn line between the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> of the critical and those of the traditional <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In the process by which the critics arrive at their conclusions there is a divergence of attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> element in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Those of the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> wing ignore, and at least tacitly deny, <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspiration</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> meaning of the term, and without any <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> preoccupations, except some hostile to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, proceed to apply critical tests to the Scriptures, in the same manner as if they were merely human productions. Moderate critics of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> persuasion &#151; a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> that predominates in Great Britain &#151; hold to inspiration and revelation, though with a freedom incompatible with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Biblical critics, while taking as postulates the plenary inspiration and the inerrancy of the sacred Writings, admit in a large measure the literary and historical conclusions reached by non-Catholic workers in this field, and maintain that these are not excluded by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. With the exception of Abb&eacute; Loisy and his followers, no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholar has claimed autonomy or complete independence for criticism, all proceeding on the principle that it cannot validly, and may not lawfully, contradict the established dogmatic teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> exponents insist that a reverent criticism is quite within its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in sifting the elements which enter into human aspects of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, as a means of a better understanding of the written word, since its component parts were given their form by men in certain historical environments and under some of the limitations of their age and place, and since, moreover, inspiration does not dispense with ordinary human industry and methods in literary composition. (See <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">INSPIRATION</a>.)

<p>Higher Criticism may be called a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, though its processes and results do not admit of nicety of control and demonstration, as its principles are of the moral-psychological order. Hence its conclusions, even in the most favourable circumstances, attain to no greater force than what arises from a convergence of probabilities, begetting a moral conviction. While some attempts have been made to elaborate a system of canons for the higher criticism, it has not, and probably never will have, a strictly defined and generally accepted code of principles and rules. Some broad principles, however, are universally admitted by critical scholars. A fundamental one is that a literary work always betrays the imprint of the age and environment in which it was produced; another is that a plurality of authors is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by well-marked differences of diction and style, at least when these coincide with distinctions in view-point or discrepancies in a double treatment of the same subject. A third received canon holds to a radical dissimilarity between ancient <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> and modern Occidental, or Aryan, methods of composition.
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Before the eighteenth century</h3>

<p>The early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers were unconscious of nearly all the problems to which criticism has given rise. Their attention was concentrated on the Divine content and authority of sacred Scripture, and, looking almost exclusively at the Divine side, they deemed as of trifling account questions of authorship, date, composition, accepting unreservedly for these points such traditions as the Jewish Church had handed down, all the more readily that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself seemed to have given various of these traditions His supreme confirmation. As for the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, tradition was the determining factor here too. As exceptions we may note that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> concluded partly from internal evidence that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> could scarcely have written the Epistle to the Hebrews, and his disciple Dionysius adduced linguistic grounds for rejecting the Apocalypse as a work of St. John. The Fathers saw in every sentence of the Scripture a pregnant <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Apparent contradictions and other difficulties were solved without taking possible human imperfection into view. Only in a few isolated passages does <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> seem to hint at such in connexion with history. Except in regard to the preservation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a> there was nothing to elicit a critical view of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in the age of the Fathers, and this applies also to the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> period. Even the Humanist movement preceding the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> gave no impulse to the critical spirit beyond fostering the study of the Scriptures in their original languages. It was not a Humanist, but the erratic Reformer Carlstadt, who first broke with tradition on the authorship of an inspired book by declaring that Moses could not have written the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, because the account of his death is in the same style as the rest of his book. But though Carlstadt adduced a critical argument he cannot be styled a critic. Hobbes (1651), Pereyre (1655), <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a> (1670) attacked the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> authorship, but merely incidentally, in works in which anything like a systematic criticism found no place. A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Richard Simon (1638-1712), was the first who subjected the general questions concerning the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> to a treatment which was at once comprehensive in scope and scientific in method. Simon is the forerunner of modern Biblical criticism. The broadening opportunities for the study of Oriental languages, a keen and methodical mind, probably, too, a reaction against the rigid view of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> which reigned amongst both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of the age were the factors which produced Simon's first great work, the "Histoire critique du Vieux Testament's, which was published in 1678. In this he called attention to the double narratives and variation of style in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, and thence <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> that, aside from the legal portion, which Moses himself had written down, much of the remaining matter was the work of several inspired <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a>, a class to whom are due the later historical books, and who in subsequent generations added touches to the inspired histories by their predecessors. This theory did not survive its author, but the use of internal evidence by which Simon arrived at it entitles him to be called the father of Biblical criticism. His novel view of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> books excited only condemnation, and his critical work, being an isolated effort which did not win the support of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, found appreciation only in recent times. A continuously developing higher criticism was not to begin till the middle of the eighteenth century. But a capital distinction is to be made between criticism as applied to the Old and as applied to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. The two have followed different courses. O. T. criticism has been developed along the lines of linguistic and historic research. Philosophico-religious prejudices have been kept in the background. But in respect to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, criticism began as the outgrowth of philosophic speculations of a distinctly anti-Christian character and, as exercised by <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> and liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, has not yet freed itself from the sway of such a priori principles, though it has tended to grow more positive &#151; that is, more genuinely critical &#151; in its methods.

<h3>Since the eighteenth century</h3>

<h4 id="i">Old Testament criticism outside the Church</h4>

<p>In 1753 <a href="../cathen/02031b.htm">Jean Astruc</a>, a French <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> physician of considerable note, published a little book, "Conjectures sur les m&eacute;moires originaux dont il para&icirc;t que Mo&iuml;se s'est servi pour composer le livre de la Gen&egrave;se", in which he conjectured, from the alternating use of two names of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the Hebrew Genesis, that Moses had incorporated therein two pre-existing documents, one of which employed <em>Elohim</em> and the other <em>Jehovah</em>. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> attracted little attention till it was taken up by a German scholar, who, however, claims to have made the discovery independently. This was Johann Gottfried Eichhorn, the author of an Introduction to the O. T., issued 1780-83, and distinguished by vigour and scientific acumen. Eichhorn was indebted not a little to his friend <a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder</a>, the noted German <em>litt&eacute;rateur,</em> and the two conjointly originated the critical habit of looking upon the O. T. as a collection of Oriental literature whose several parts are to be read and interpreted as the productions of the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> genius. Eichhorn greatly developed <a href="../cathen/02031b.htm">Astruc's</a> hypothesis by observing that the <a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">Elohim</a> and <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a> sections of Genesis bear other characteristics, and by extending the analysis thus derived to the whole <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. But the German savant was not so <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> an adherent of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> authorship as was <a href="../cathen/02031b.htm">Astruc</a>, since he left to the Hebrew legislator a very uncertain part of the work. When Eichhorn composed his "Introduction" he was somewhat influenced by <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinking</a> views which later became very pronounced. His criticism, therefore, had as its antecedents not only <a href="../cathen/02031b.htm">Astruc's</a> fruitful conjecture and <a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder's</a> poetic insight into Oriental literature, but also eighteenth-century German <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>. This was in part native to the soil, but it drew much nurture from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deists</a> and Sceptics, who flourished towards the end of the seventeenth century and in the first part of the eighteenth. Such authors as Blount (1654-93) and Collins (1676-1729) had impugned <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and prophecy and in general the authority of the O.T. writings. The standpoint of the German <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a> Reimarus was that of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deists</a>; the whole drift of his "Wolfenb&uuml;ttel Fragments", first appearing 1774-78, is one of antagonism to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. Lessing (1729-81), his literary executor, without departing so offensively from the path of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, defended the fullest freedom of discussion in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> matters. Contemporary with Lessing was J. S. Semler, who rejected inspiration, attributed a mythical character to episodes in O.T. historical books, and, on lines parallel to Lessing's philosophy of religion, distinguished in Scripture elements of permanent and others of transitory and negligible value.

<p>Eichhorn is the first typical representative of modern Biblical criticism, the especial home of which has been <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He gave the first impulse to the literary analysis of the Scriptures, applying it not only to the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, but also to Isaias and other portions of the O. T. Outside of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the views of Eichhorn and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> found little currency. Yet it was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Scottish origin, Alexander Geddes (1737-1802), who broached a theory of the origin of the Five Books (to which he attached <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a>) exceeding in boldness either Simon's or Eichhorn 's. This was the well-known "Fragment" hypothesis, which reduced the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> to a collection of fragmentary sections partly of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> origin, but put together in the reign of Solomon. Geddes' opinion was introduced into <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1805 by Vater. For the fuller account of this and later stages of the criticism of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> the reader is referred to the article under that heading. With some essays of a young scholar, De Wette, which were published 1805-07, properly began the historical criticism of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. De Wette joined to the evidences supplied by vocabulary and style (i.e. those of literary criticism) arguments drawn from history, as contained in the sacred narratives themselves, and the discoveries of antiquarian research. He refused to find anything but legend and poetry in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, though he granted it a unity of plan, and a development in accordance with his conception of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> history, thus laying the foundation for the leading hypothesis of the present day. De Wette's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> also furnished the basis for the Supplement-theory, systematized later by Bleek and others. He was the first to attack the historical character of the books of Paralipomenon, or Chronicles. Bleek (1793-1859), Ewald (1803-75), and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10606a.htm">Movers</a> (1806-56), while following critical methods, opposed the purely negative criticism of De Wette and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and sought to save the authenticity of some <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> books and Davidic psalms by sacrificing that of others. Bleek revived, and brought into prominence, the conclusion of Geddes, that the book of Josue is in close literary connexion with the first five books of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, and thenceforth the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07318a.htm">Hexateuch</a>, or sixfold work, has been maintained by advanced <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a>. Hupfeld, in 1853, found four instead of three documents in the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, viz., the first Elohist, comprising the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> law, a second Elohist (hitherto unsuspected except by a forgotten investigator, Ilgen), the Jehovist, and the Deuteronomist. He allowed to none of these a <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> origin. With Hupfeld's view the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of one large source, or <em>Grundschrift,</em> supplemented by smaller ones, began to give place to the "Document" hypothesis. Meanwhile these conclusions, so subversive of ancient traditions regarding the Five Books, were stoutly contested by a number of German scholars, prominent among whom stood Ranke, H&auml;vernick, Hengstenberg, and Keil, among <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; and Jahn, <a href="../cathen/07515a.htm">Hug</a>, <a href="../cathen/07251a.htm">Herbst</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15587a.htm">Welte</a>, representing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> learning. These, while refusing to allow the testimony of Jewish tradition to be ruled out of court as invalid against internal evidence, were compelled to employ the methods of their adversaries in defending the time-honoured views. The questions were agitated only in countries where <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> predominated, and, among these, in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the conservative views were strongly entrenched.

<p>The critical dissection of books was and is accomplished on the ground of diversity of vocabulary and style, the phenomena of double narratives of the same event varying from each other, it is claimed, to the extent of discrepancy, and differences of religious conceptions. The critics appeal for confirmation of this literary analysis to the historical books. For example, Moses could not have enacted an elaborate ritual legislation for a people leading a nomad life in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, especially since we find (say the critics) no trace of its observance in the earliest periods of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> settled existence. These and like tests are applied to nearly every book of the O. T., and result in conclusions which, if allowed, profoundly modify the traditional <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> regarding the authorship and integrity of these Scriptures, and are incompatible with any strict notion of their inerrancy.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a> principle of evolution has undoubtedly influenced German criticism, and indirectly Biblical criticism in general. Applied to religion, it has powerfully helped to beget a tendency to regard the religion of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> as evolved by processes not transcending nature, from a <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheistic</a> worship of the elements to a spiritual and <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheism</a>. This theory was first elaborated by Abram Kuenen, a <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, in his "Religion of Israel" (1869-70). Without being essential to, it harmonizes with the current system of Pentateuchal criticism, sometimes called "the Development Hypothesis", but better known as "the Grafian". This hypothesis is accepted today by the great body of non-Catholic Biblical scholarship. It makes the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> a growth formed by the piecing and interlacing together of documents representing distinct epochs. Of these the oldest is the Jehovistic, or J, dating from the ninth century B.C.; E, the Elohistic work, was composed a little later. These elements are prophetic in spirit and narrative in matter. D, the Deuteronomic Code, was the organ and instrument of the prophetic reform under Josias; it appeared 621 B.C.P, the great document containing the Priestly Code, was drawn up after the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">Babylonian Exile</a>, and is the outcome of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> and ritual formalism distinguishing the restored Jewish community; it therefore dates from the fifth century B.C. This ingenious and coherent hypothesis was formulated first by E. Reuss of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, but presented to the public many years later (1866) by his disciple H. K. Graf. It was skilfully elaborated by Julius Wellhausen, professor (in 1908) at the University of G&ouml;ttingen, in works published in 1883 and 1889 ("Prolegomena to the History of Israel" and "Composition of the <a href="../cathen/07318a.htm">Hexateuch</a> and the Historical Books of the O. T."), and today it dominates the critical treatment of the <a href="../cathen/07318a.htm">Hexateuch</a>. The shifting of the Priestly Code (formerly called the First Elohist) from the earliest to the latest in time, a characteristic of the Grafian system, has had a marked influence on the drift of O. T. criticism in general, notably with regard to the books of Paralipomenon. It has reversed the chronological order of the prophetical and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> elements running through the greater part of the O. T.

<p>Only within the last two decades has higher criticism made notable progress in English-speaking lands, and this has been rendered possible by the moderation of its leading spokesman there. Foremost among these semi-orthodox critics of the O. T. is Professor Driver of Oxford, whose "Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament" first appeared in 1891. W. Robertson Smith in "The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and the Jewish Church" had previously (1880), though less systematically, presented the Grafian hypothesis to the English-speaking world. The results of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> conservative criticism are embodied in Hastings' "Dictionary of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>", while the radical wing in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is represented by the "Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica" edited by Professors Cheyne and Black. In America most of the conclusions of German criticism have found advocates in Professors C.H. Briggs ("The Bible, the Church and Reason", 1892; "Higher Criticism of the Hexateuch", 1893), H.P. Smith, and C.H. Toy.

<p>The higher criticism claims to have discerned great inequalities in the value of those portions of the O. T. which are historical in form. In the same book we may find, it asserts, myth, legend, and material of real historical worth, the last of these elements being abundant in Judges and the Books of Kings, though even here a careful sifting must be used. In parts of the <a href="../cathen/07318a.htm">Hexateuch</a>, especially in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> document and the cognate Paralipomenon writing, history is freely idealized, and existing institutions are projected artificially into the remote past. Esther, Tobias, Judith, Jonas, and portions of II Machabees belong to the class of Jewish Haggadah, or moralizing fictions. The Psalms have few if any compositions by <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>; they are the religious poetry of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Isaias is a composite, containing messages of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> widely separated in time and circumstances. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> spoke and wrote primarily in view of definite contemporary situations. Job is an epic, and Canticles a pastoral drama. The <a href="../bible/dan000.htm">book of Daniel</a> is an apocalypse of the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> period, describing history of the past and present under the semblance of visions of the future. To conclude this outline of the critical results, the human element in Scripture is given prominence and represented as clothed with the imperfections, limitations, and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the times of its origin; many books are exhibited as the products of successive literary accretions, excluding any unity of authorship; in fact, for most of the histories, the unknown writers retire into the shadow to give place to the unifying labours of the equally unknown "redactor" or "redactors".

<h4 id="ii">The reaction against criticism</h4>

<p>This has been aided by the antithesis between the conclusions of certain Assyriologists of note (viz., A. H. Sayce and F. Hommel) and the prevailing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of criticism. Recent discoveries in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Mesopotamia, and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> prove that a developed civilization existed in Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> in times contemporary with Abraham, and earlier. (See <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">BABYLONIA</a>; <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">ASSYRIA</a>.) The inference drawn by the above scientists (Sayce, "Higher Criticism and the Verdict of the Monuments", 1895; Hommel, "Ancient Hebrew Tradition", tr., 1897) is that the elaborate ritual and legal code of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> could well have been framed by Moses. They charge the critics with not taking Oriental discoveries sufficiently into account, and argue that, since the monuments confirm the substantial <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of some of the historical books, a presumption is raised in favour of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> of Hebrew literature in general. The historical character of the narratives is upheld by other considerations of a more minute and technical nature. In America the old views of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> were defended with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and learning by Dr. William H. Green, of Princeton, author of a series of Biblical works extending from 1863 to 1899; also by E.C. Bissel and W. L. Baxter. In Great Britain the conservatives have been represented in recent times by Alfred Cave, J.J. Lias, and others. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, J. K. F. Keil, who died in 1888, was the last <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a> of international name who stood without compromise for tradition. But a contemporary group of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> German <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalists</a> have championed the claims of the O. T. as a Divinely inspired literature, whose narratives, on the whole, are worthy of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Prominent among these are Dr. F. E. K&ouml;nig of Bonn ("Neue Prinzipien der alttestamentlichen Kritik", 1902, "Bibel-Babel Frage und die wissenschaftliche Methode", 1904); Julius B&ouml;hm, a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>; Dr. Samuel Oettli, professor at <a href="../cathen/07025a.htm">Greifswald</a>. The resistance to the so-called scientific criticism in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> has been greatly stimulated by the radical positions recently taken by some Assyriologists, beginning with a lecture delivered in 1902 before the German court by Friedrich Delitzsch. The still-continuing discussion it provoked is known as the Bibel-Babel controversy. Delitzsch, Jensen, and their followers contend that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> stories of the Creation, the Fall, the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">Deluge</a>, etc. were borrowed by the Hebrews from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, where they existed in their pure and original form. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> relegates all the events and personages of Genesis to the region of myths and attributes a Chaldean origin to the Jewish conception of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Sheol</a>, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>. Of still more recent beginning and extravagant character is the theory of astral myths defended by Stucken, Winckler, and Jeremias, according to which the narrations not only of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, but of large portions of the later books as well, represent in human guise merely the nature and movements of the heavenly bodies.

<p>In replying to the critical systems, conservatives, both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, re-enforce the argument from Jewish and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> traditions by methods borrowed from their opponents; linguistic distinctions are countered by linguistic arguments, and the traditionists also employ the process of comparing the data of one book with another, in an endeavour to bring all into harmony. Not the methods so much as the conclusions of criticism are impugned. The difference is largely one of interpretation. However, the conservatives complain that the critics arbitrarily rule out as interpolations or late comments passages which are unfavourable to their hypotheses. The advocates of tradition also charge the opposite <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with being swayed by purely subjective fancies, and in the case of the more advanced criticism, by philosophico-religious prejudices. Moreover, they assert that such a piecemeal formation of a book by successive strata, as is alleged for many parts of the O. T. is without analogy in the history of literature. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> criticism of the O. T. will be described in a separate section of this article.

<h4 id="iii">New Testament criticism outside the Church</h4>

<p>Before the eighteenth century N. T. criticism did not go beyond that of the Latin and Greek texts, if we except the ancient remarks on the authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews and the Apocalypse already noticed. When the German <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> of the eighteenth century, in imitation of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a> of the seventeenth, had discarded the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> became the first object of a systematic attack. Reimarus (1094-1768) assailed the motives of its writers and cast aspersions on the honesty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Himself. J.S. Semler (1725-91) used the greatest latitude in discussing the origin and credibility of the sacred Scriptures, arguing that these subjects should be dealt with without regard to any Divine content. Semler was the first to question the authenticity of N. T. books from a critical standpoint. His <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> principles, if admitted, would largely destroy the authority of the Gospels. Paulus (1761-1851), professor at Jena and Heidelberg, granted the genuineness of the Gospels, and their authors' honesty of purpose, but taught that in narrating the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> the Apostles and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> recorded their delusions, and that all the alleged superhuman occurrences are to be explained by merely natural causes. Eichhorn, the pioneer of modern German criticism, carried his inquiries into the field of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and, beginning with 1794, proposed a theory to explain the similarities and differences of the Synoptic Gospels, i.e. Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Some phases of what is now known as "the Synoptic Problem" were examined by Griesbach as early as 1776, and again, in 1781, by a posthumous essay of Lessing treating of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> "considered simply as human historians". The problem was first clearly formulated by Lachmann in 1835. The dangerous tendencies of the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> writers were ably combated by J. L. <a href="../cathen/07515a.htm">Hug</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, whose "Introduction to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>" was completed in 1808. Schleiermacher (1768-1834) was the earliest of those German <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who acknowledge the religious force of the sacred writings, but imperil their authority by a free and independent treatment of their origin and historical contents; his view of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> was influenced by Semler's criticisms. Somewhat akin to Schleiermacher's attitude is that of De Wette, but his conclusions are often negative and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. The Evangelistic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> German commentators, represented earliest by Guericke, Olshausen, Neander, and Bleek, were in the main adherents to the genuineness and truthfulness of the Gospels, though influenced by the mediating or mystico-rationalistic tendencies of Schleiermacher. As N. T. scholars they belong between 1823 and 1859.

<p>The "Life of Jesus" by David Friedrich Strauss, which appeared in 1835, marked a new departure of view with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and made a great sensation. Strauss was an <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a> and one for whom the "ideas' obscured the objective facts, while it rested upon them. He held that the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> conception of Christ was the creature of the ardent <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> hopes of the Jewish-Christians of the primitive Church, who imagined that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> fulfilled the O. T. prophecies, and who, soon after His death, invested His <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and the whole tenor of His life with mythical qualities, in which there was nothing but a bare kernel of objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, viz., the existence of a rabbi named <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who was a man of extraordinary spiritual power and penetration, and who had gathered about him a band of disciples. Echoes of these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are to be found in Renan's "Vie de J&eacute;sus". Strauss's relatively refined philosophy of religion was more in the spirit of the age than the moribund, crude <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> of Paulus, though it only substituted one form of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> for another. The "Life of Jesus" soon called forth refutations, but in the advanced circles of German thought the finishing stroke was not given to it until Ferdinand Christian Baur, the founder of the T&uuml;bingen, or "Tendency", <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> and criticism, published the mature fruit of his speculation under the title "Paulus der Apostel Jesu Christi", in 1845. Baur, like Strauss, was a disciple of <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, but had taken from that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> a different key to the significance of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, viz., the principle of the evolution of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through the conciliation of contradictions. He taught that the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is the outcome of an antagonism between Jewish, or Petrine, and Pauline tendencies in the primitive Church. The Pauline concept of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> &#151; one of a philosophic and universal order &#151; is represented by the Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, and Galatians, which alone Baur admitted as the certainly authentic works of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. The Apocalypse was composed in direct opposition to the spirit of the Pauline writings. The above works were written before A.D. 70. Between 70 and 140 appeared St. Matthew's Gospel, Petrine in character; <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">St. Luke's Gospel</a>, Pauline, though retouched in a conciliatory spirit; Acts, adapted similarly to St. Luke; and latest the Gospel of St. Mark, also of an irenic type. This second period is one of transition between antagonism and complete reconciliation. This latter is the note of the third period, reaching to about A.D. 170, which produced the Gospel and Epistles bearing the name of St. John, and the pastoral Epistles, which therefore cannot have come from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. The scheme excluded the authenticity of all the Gospels. Baur's theory has not survived except in the very mitigated form seen in the works of Hilgenfeld and Pfleiderer. Nevertheless, aside from his philosophic assumptions, the principles and methods of Baur have left a deep impress on later N. T. criticism. He first practised on a consistent and developed plan the habit of scrutinizing the sacred documents themselves for evidences of the times which gave them birth, and led the way in the present critical trend towards a division of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> into Judaistic, Pauline, and Johannine elements.

<p>The T&uuml;bingen <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> evoked a reaction against their destructive and purely <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> conclusions. This movement has been twofold: on one side it is <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, though critical in its method; this section is the natural continuation of the earlier Evangelistic <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, and counts as its ablest representatives Zahn, B. Weiss, and Godet; the other branch is partly the outgrowth of the Schleiermacher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and acknowledges as its founder Albert <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a>, whose defection from the T&uuml;bingen group (1857) <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a serious blow to Baur's system. The <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschlian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> insists on the religious value of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, especially in the impression its picture of Christ makes on the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and on the other hand allows a free rein to the boldest and most searching criticism of the origin and historical worth of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> books, in a blind mystic confidence that nothing that criticism can do will impair their religious value. The indifference of the <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschlians</a> to the consequences of criticism is also shown towards the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> element in our Lord's life and in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in general. This tendency is very manifest among other contemporary German critics, who, while influenced by <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschlianism</a>, belong rather to the "scientific" and evolutionary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Holtzmann, Bousset, J&uuml;licher, Harnack, Schmiedel by critical procedure eliminate from the Gospels, or at least call into <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> elements, and reduce the Divinity of Christ to a moral, pre-eminent sonship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet, by a strange inconsequence, exalt the saving and enlightening power of His <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. This latest <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, however, admit dates which approach much nearer to the traditional ones than to those of Baur. Harnack, besides affirming the genuineness of all the Pauline Epistles except the pastoral ones, and of Mark and Luke, places the Synoptic Gospels between A.D. 65 and 93, and fixes the year 110 as the latest limit for the Gospel and Epistles of St. John and the Apocalypse.

<p>In Great Britain, N. T. criticism with few exceptions has been moderate and, on the whole, conservative. Excellent service has been done in the defence of contested books by the British divines J. B. Lightfoot, B. F. Westcott, W. H. Sanday, and others. <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> has produced a small group of radical critics, Van Manen, Pierson, Loman, who, with Steck in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, have revived Bruno Bauer's total denial of authenticity to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> Letters. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> conservatism has been the keynote of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> scholars Pressens&eacute; and Godet; a rationalizing evolutionism that of Sabatier. Abb&eacute; Loisy's work will be spoken of below.

<p>A brief summary of the situation of particular books in contemporary non-Catholic criticism follows:

<h5>The synoptic Gospels</h5>

<p>The prevalent critical solution of the problem they present is the "two-document" hypothesis, which explains what is common to all of them by supposing that Matthew and Luke drew from the very early Gospel bearing St. Mark's name or an anterior Apostolic document on which Mark is based, and refers the material which is common to Matthew and Luke only to a primitive Aramaic source compiled by one or more immediate disciples of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, possibly St. Matthew. <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">St. Luke's Gospel</a> is recognized as authentic; our canonical Mark as at least virtually so.

<h5>Acts</h5>

<p>The integrity and entire genuineness of the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> have been assailed by a few recent critics: Hilgenfeld, Spitta, Clemen. They would analyze the work into a number of sections, by different authors, including St. Luke, rearranged by successive editors, and containing materials varying much in value. No conscious falsification was used, but legendary narratives crept in. These critics are by no means unanimous as to particulars.

<h5>Epistles of St. Paul</h5>

<p>Romans, Corinthians, and Galatians are acknowledged by all serious scholars to be authentic writings of the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. About Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians, and Philemon there is diversity of opinion. First Thessalonians is generally admitted to be genuine, but the Pauline authorship of the second letter of that name is strongly contested. The weight of non-Catholic critical opinion is against the authenticity of the pastoral Epistles, viz., the two to Timothy and the one to Titus. The Epistle to the Hebrews is assigned to an Alexandrian Jewish convert, contemporary, or almost so, with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and a disciple of his teaching. This is also the view of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. First Peter is generally held to be the work of that Apostle, but the composition of Second Peter is placed in the second century, even some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> inclining to this date. The question whether the Epistles of St. James and St. Jude are from the pens of the Apostles of those names is variously answered outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<h5>The Johannine writings</h5>

<p>The authenticity and authority of St. John's Gospel form the great battlefield of present N. T. criticism. They had been attacked as early as 1792 by a certain Evanson. The majority of contemporary critics incline to Harnack's view, which is that the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> was composed by John the Presbyter or the "elder" referred to in a fragment by Papias, and asserted by the Harnackians to be distinct from the Apostle and a disciple of the latter. He wrote in the beginning of the second century. Loisy attributes it to an unknown writer of the second century who had no affiliations with St. John. But the historical value of this Evangel is the more vital aspect of the question. The German <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of criticism characterizes the Gospel as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and symbolism, not history; Loisy agrees with them. The Apostolic authorship and historicity of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> have been vindicated by such critical scholars as Sanday, Stanton, and Drummond in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and Zahn and B. Weiss in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Orthodox <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a>, while always holding to the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> of the Johannine authorship and historical quality of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>, admit that St. John's <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> indicates reflection and a development over and beyond that of the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a>. The first Epistle of St. John is universally admitted to be by the same hand as the Gospel. The criticism of Apocalypse is still in an immature stage. There is much diversity of view as to its author, the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> inclining to St. John. It has been recently proposed that the book is a Jewish apocalypse retouched by a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; so Vischer, Harnack. Nearly all critics acknowledge that there is much apocalyptic element in it, admitting that some of its visions in a veiled manner depict historical situations under the guise of events to come.

<h4 id="iv">The critical movement within the Church</h4>

<h5>Old Testament criticism</h5>

<p>France, the country of Richard Simon and <a href="../cathen/02031b.htm">Astruc</a>, has been also that of the beginning of the present-day <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> criticism. <a href="../cathen/09151a.htm">Fran&ccedil;ois Lenormant</a>, a distinguished <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a>, in the preface to his "Origines de l'histoire d'apr&egrave;s la Bible et les traditions des peuples Orientaux" (1880-84), declared no longer tenable the traditional unity of authorship for the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, and admitted as demonstrated that the fundamental sources of its first four books were a Jehovist and Elohist document, each inspired and united by a "final redactor". Minor discordances exist between them. The earlier chapters of Genesis contain mythical and legendary elements common to <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> peoples, which in the hands of the inspired writers became the "figured vestments of eternal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>". The same preface bespeaks entire liberty for the critic in the matter of dates and authors. <a href="../cathen/09151a.htm">Lenormant's</a> work was placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a>, 19 December, 1887. The basis of his literary analysis was supplied by the conclusions of higher criticism, up to that time unaccepted, at least publicly, by any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> savant. E. Reuss, a liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> professor at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, had published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1879, "L'Histoire Sainte et la Loi; Pentateuque et Josu&eacute;". In 1883 appeared Wellhausen's influential "Prolegomena to the History of Israel", re-edited in 1889 under the title, "Composition of the Hexateuch and the Historical Books of the O. T."

<p>Alfred Loisy, then professor of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> at the Institut Catholique of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in his inaugural lecture for the course of 1892-93 made a clear-cut plea for the exercise of criticism in the study of the human side of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> ("Enseignement Biblique", Nov.-Dec., 1892; reprinted in "Les &eacute;tudes bibliques", 1894). In an essay which appeared in 1893, Loisy discussed the "Biblical Question", reasserted the right of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> to treat critically the general aspects of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and also its interpretations, and rejected its absolute inerrancy, while holding to its total inspiration. The historical portions offer data which have only a "relative truth", i.e. with reference to the age in which they were written. The author enumerated conclusions of the criticism which he regarded as fixed; these included the non-Mosaic authorship of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, the unhistorical character of the first chapters of Genesis, the development of Biblical <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Early in the same year <a href="../cathen/07538a.htm">Mgr. d'Hulst</a>, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Institut Catholique of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, had drawn acute attention to the progress of critical <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scientific circles by an article in the "Correspondant" of 25 January, 1893, entitled "La Question Biblique", in which he expressed the opinion that the admission of inaccuracies in Scripture is theologically tenable. The discussion of these questions was the occasion of the encyclical "Providentissimus Deus", issued by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 18 November, 1893, in which the total inerrancy of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was declared to be the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequence of its <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspiration</a>. The unwarranted concessions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers to <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> criticism and the exclusive use of internal arguments against historical authority were condemned as contrary to correct principles of criticism. Sound Biblical criticism was commended. Similar commendation was given in the Apostolic letter. "Vigilanti&aelig;", establishing the <a href="../cathen/02557a.htm">Biblical Commission</a>, 30 October, 1902.

<p>In a paper read before the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Scientific Congress of Fribourg, 1897 (Revue Biblique, January, 1898), Father M. J. Lagrange, superior of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Biblical studies at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, defended a literary analysis and an evolution of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> which are substantially identical with those of the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis. He distinguished between the tradition that Moses was the historical author or founder of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, which he retained, and the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> literary authorship, which he abandoned. Like Loisy, the learned <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> maintained that the literary methods of the ancient Orient are sharply differentiated from those of our civilization. During the last decade a considerable number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Biblical scholars have coalesced into what has been called the "progressive" <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Naturally disagreeing somewhat in details, they agree in holding <ul><li>the composite texture and progressive formation of a number of sacred books, and in abandoning therefore their traditional unity of authorship; <li>in allowing a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and moral development in the Old Testament; <li>in admitting an extensive tacit insertion of popular traditions and written sources, which contain unhistorical statements.</ul>

<p>Nevertheless these <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> hold firmly to the objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the essential and larger lines of the history of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Dispensation</a> as embodied in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. They assert that in general the question of the literary procedure of Biblical writers is not one of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Their position has met with repeated attacks by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> adherents of the conservative <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, who have combated them with arguments drawn chiefly from the irreconcilability of the new views with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> dogmatic tradition of inspiration and inerrancy as witnessed, it is alleged, in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, the Fathers, the teachings of the councils of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> and the Vatican, and particularly the encyclical of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">INSPIRATION</a>). The principal adversaries of the advanced conclusions are the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Delattre (Autour de la question biblique, 1904), Brucker (contributions to the "Etudes" between 1894 and 1905), Fontaine, Fonck, Pesch, (De Inspiratione Sac. Scrip., 1906), <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillo</a>, Billot; also Professor Hoberg and Abb&eacute; Mangenot (L'Authenticit&eacute; du Pentateuque, 1907).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02557a.htm">Biblical Commission</a>, whose decisions have now the force of acts of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, declared, 13 February, 1905, that the fallibility of implicit citations in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> might be admitted, provided solid arguments prove that they are really citations, and that the sacred writer does not adopt them as his own. The Commission conceded on 23 June, 1905, that some passages may be historical in appearance only, always saving the sense and judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On 27 June, 1906, the commission declared that the arguments alleged by critics do not disprove the substantial authorship of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> by Moses. This decision has necessarily modified the attitude of such <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers and teachers as favoured in a greater or less degree the conclusions of the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> "Lamentabili" (3 July, 1907) and the encyclical "Pascendi Dominici Gregis" (8 September, 1907) reasserted against the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a> the sound, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles to be followed in the study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>.

<h5>New Testament criticism</h5>

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars who were willing to accept some of the critical theories have drawn a line of distinction between the criticism of the Old and that of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, not only because of the greater delicacy of the latter field, but because they recognize that the documents of the Old and New Dispensations were produced under quite different conditions. In the province of N. T. higher criticism <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have defended the traditional authenticity, integrity, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> of the books in question. Some <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> admit in a slight measure divergencies in the Evangelical narratives, and the employment of older documents by at least two of the Synoptic writers. As to the "Synoptic problem", it is allowed that at least St. Luke utilized St. Mark's Gospel; so Batiffol, Minocchi, Lagrange, Loisy, Bonaccorsi, Gigot. Unduly influenced by contemporary German criticism, Abb&eacute; Loisy has in recent times broken with the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> traditions of N. T. <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. In a reply to Harnack's "What is Christianity?" he defended <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> as an evolution with its roots in the Primitive Church, but made dangerous concessions regarding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> claim to Divinity, His <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> vocation, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> ("L'Evangile et l'&Eacute;glise", 1902; "Autour d'un petit livre", 1903). In "Le Quatri&egrave;me Evangile" (1903) Loisy rejects the Johannine authorship and the historicity of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>, both of which were affirmed by the <a href="../cathen/02557a.htm">Biblical Commission</a> (29 May, 1907). His system virtually severs the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> from its historical credentials as found in the. N. T., and the above works have been condemned by the Congregation of the Index. They have drawn out a number of refutations from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apologists, such as the Abb&eacute; Lepin's "J&eacute;sus Messie et Fils de Dieu" (1904). More recently Loisy published a work on the Synoptic Gospels (Les &eacute;vangiles synoptiques, 1908) in which he follows the most extravagant <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> criticism. Loisy was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> 7 March, 1908. As has been remarked, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> warmly recommends the exercise of criticism according to sound principles unbiased by <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> presuppositions, but it must condemn undue deference to heterodox writers and any conclusions at variance with <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. When <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> arises about the permissibility of hypotheses, it is for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority to decide how far they consist with the deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or are expedient to the welfare of religion.
