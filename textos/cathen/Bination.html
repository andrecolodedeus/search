<h1>Bination</h1>  

<p>The offering up of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a> twice on the same day by the same <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">celebrant</a>.

<p>It is believed by some (Magani, L'Antica Liturgia Romana, Pt. I, p. 296, Pt. II, p. 187) that even from Apostolic times private Masses were celebrated whenever convenient. Be this as it may, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that in the first years of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> public Masses were offered on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> only; later, on Wednesdays and Fridays also (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, De Oratione, xiv). To these three days Saturday was added, especially in the East (<a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, Ep. cclxxxix). <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, who died in 430, assures us (Ep. liv.) that while, in his time, <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated only on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> in some places, in others on Saturdays and <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, it was nevertheless in many places customary to have the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> daily (St. August., op. cit.), in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Council of Toledo, year 400), in Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (<a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, Sermo xxv), in Constatinople (St. John Chrysos. In Ep. ad Ephesios), as well as elsewhere. The daily Mass became universal about the close of the sixth century. Nay more, it was not long before <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> began to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> two, three or more times daily, according to their own desire, till the sacred canons (Gratian, De Conseer., dist. I, can. liii) put a limit to their devotion in this regard, and <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> (d. 1073) decreed that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should be content with saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> once a day, unless it should be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to offer a second - never more - for the dead. Notwithstanding this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a>, the practice continued of celebrating oftener on some of the greater feasts: thus on the first of January one Mass was said of the Octave of the Nativity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, another in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>; three Masses were said by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>, in one of which sinners were reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a second for the Consecration of the Oils, and a third in keeping with the feast; two Masses were said on the Vigil of the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a>, as well as on the feast itself; three Masses were celebrated on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and three also on the Nativity of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John Baptist</a>. On the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> said one Mass in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">basilica of St. Peter</a> and a second in <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">that of St. Paul</a>. Finally, abolishing all these customs, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> (d. 1216) prescribed that a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should say but one Mass daily, except on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, when he might offer the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> three times; while <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (d. 1227) extended this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> to all dignitaries. This then is the discipline of both the Eastern and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, from which no one may recede without grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>It must be noted, nevertheless, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has found it advisable under certain conditions to modify her discipline in this regard. Thus <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> permits a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to say two Masses on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Holy Days of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, in care of necessity, when, namely, a number of faithful would otherwise be deprived of the opportunity of hearing <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. This would be verified, for example, were a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in charge of two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or missions with no other celebrant available, or were the church too small to accommodate at one time all the parishioners (See <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Declarasti", of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, Bullarium IV, 32 sqq., 16 March, 1746; <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, Litt. Apost. "Trans Oceanum", 18 April, 1897). The ordinary of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, however, is to judge, in these and similar cases, of the necessity of binating. For similar causes, the gravity of which is not quite so apparent, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> grants to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of missionary countries the privilege of saying two Masses (three in Mexico, according to an <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, Acta S. Sedis, XIII, 340, XXIX, 96) on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Holy Days of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, under conditions practically the same as stated above (See <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Apostolicum ministerium", of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, for the Anglican Missions, 30 May, 1753, Bullarium, X, 197 sqq.; Conc. Plen. Balt. III, Tit. Iii, cap. I; Acta et Decreta Conc. Plen. Americae Latinae, no. 348 sqq.; <a href="../cathen/12584c.htm">Putzer</a>, "Commentarium in Facultates Apost.", no. 159 sqq.). As regards permission to binate, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are agreed that it should not be given unless about thirty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> would otherwise be put to notable inconvenience to avoid missing Mass. In certain extraordinary cases this number is reduced to twenty, while, if there is question of those detained in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> or bound by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, from ten to fifteen inmates will suffice to permit bination. It must be borne in mind that even in such cases a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is permitted to say a second (never a third) Mass only in case another celebrant may not be had; that a stipend may not be accepted for the second Mass; that the ablutions are not to be taken at the first Mass, as this would break the fast prescribed. A celebrant who is to say two Masses in the same church uses the same <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> for both, not purifying it at the first Mass. If the second Mass is to be said in a different church, the celebrant immediately after the last Gospel of the first Mass returns to the centre of the altar, consumes whatever drops of the Precious Blood may still remain in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and then purifies the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> with water only. This water, which is poured from the chalice into a glass on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, is consumed together with the second ablution of a subsequent Mass, or emptied into the sacrarium. It might even be given to a lay <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is in the state of grace and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, as is done with the water in which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> fingers are cleansed, when <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> is given to the sick. The <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> thus purified at the end of the first Mass may be used for the second Mass or not, as the celebrant may see fit.

<p><a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Pope Benedict XIV</a> (d. 1758) conceded to all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a>, of the kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the privilege of saying three Masses on <a href="../cathen/01315b.htm">All Souls' Day</a> (2 November). This privilege still holds for all places which belonged to one or other of these kingdoms at the time when it was granted. The ordinary stipend is allowed for one only of these Masses; while the other two must be offered for all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>.
