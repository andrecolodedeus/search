<h1>Birds (In Symbolism)</h1>  

<p>Many kinds of birds are used in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> symbolism. The first to be so employed was the <em>Dove</em>; it stood for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Third Person of the Blessed Trinity</a>, for when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the Holy Ghost descended in bodily shape as a dove upon Him (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs22">Luke 3:22</a>). It was also used as a symbol of peace, because a dove brought to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> a bough of an olive-tree as a sign that the deluge of wrath was at an end. In early <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> the Apostles and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were generally represented as doves, the first because they were the instruments of the Holy Ghost, carrying peace to the world; the second because in their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> they received the gift of reconciliation, entering with the dove (the Holy Ghost) into the Ark of God, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Sometimes in symbolical writing it stands for rest: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will be at rest? &#151; (<a href="../bible/psa054.htm#vrs7">Psalm 54:7</a>); often for simplicity, innocence, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: Be ye therefore wise as serpents and simple as doves (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs16">Matthew 10:16</a>); Open to me, my sister, my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, my dove, my undefiled; One is my dove, my perfect one. (Cant., v, 2; vi, 8.) The <em>Eagle</em> is a symbol of Christ and His Divine nature, of regeneration by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; it is also an emblem of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>. As the eagle can gaze upon the shining orb of the sun with steadfast eyes, so can Christ gaze undazzled upon the refulgent glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>. <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> refers to the strong eye of the eagle (Parad., i, 47, 48): --

<blockquote><p>I saw Beatrice turn'd, and on the sun <br>Gazing, as never eagle fix'd his ken.</p></blockquote>

<p>-- It was a popular delusion among the ancients that the eagle could renew its youth by plunging three times into a spring of pure water, a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> alluded to by <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>: Thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle's (<a href="../bible/psa102.htm#vrs5">Psalm 102:5</a>), hence the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and later the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> symbolizers, used the eagle as a sign of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the well-spring of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in whose water the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a> was dipped three times, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, in order to wash from his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the old man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and put on the youth of a child of light. This bird was used as the emblem of St. John, because in his Gospel St. John dwells particularly upon the Divinity of the Redeemer and contemplates with the unflinching eye of an eagle the highest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>.

<p>The <em>Pelican</em> is a symbol of the atonement and the Redeemer. It was supposed to wound itself in order to feed its young with its blood and to bring to life those who were dead &#151; the "pelicane who stricketh blood out of its owne bodye to do others good" (Lyly, Euphues). Allusion is made to this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in "Hamlet" (act iv): --</p>

<blockquote><p>To his good friend thus wide I'll ope my arms <br>And, like the kind, life-rendering pelican, <br>Repast them with my blood.</p></blockquote>

<p>Therefore it was deemed a fitting symbol of the Saviour, the <em>nostro pelicano</em> of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, Who shed His blood in order to give eternal life to the children of men. Skelton in his "Armorie of Birds" says: --</p>

<blockquote><p>Then sayd the Pellycan: <br>When my Byrdts be slayne <br>With my bloude I them revyve. <br>Scripture doth record <br>The same dyd our Lord <br>And rose from deth to lyve.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <em>Phoenix</em> is a symbol of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. According to legend this mythical bird could never die; on attaining its five-hundredth year it committed itself to the flames of a funeral pyre, only to rise reborn from its own ashes. <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> used it as a symbol of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the damned (Inf., xxiv, 197-208).</p>

<p>The <em>Peacock</em> in Byzantine and early Romanesque art was used to signify the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a>, because its flesh was thought to be incorruptible. (<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, City of God, xxi, c, iv.) It was also a symbol of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. The <em>Raven</em> is a symbol of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of confession and penance. The <em>Cock</em> is a symbol of vigilance, and also an emblem of St. Peter. The <em>Vulture</em> has always typified <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a>. Many other birds were used during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> for symbolic and ecclesiological purposes; while the preachers of these centuries developed the symbolism of each one of these emblems to a degree that now seems far-fetched and often obscure, nevertheless, they made it clear that religious instruction can be gained from birds and even from the common things of life.
