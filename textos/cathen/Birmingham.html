<h1>Birmingham</h1>  

<p>(BIRMINGHAMIA, BIRMINGHAMIENSIS)

<p>One of the thirteen <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> erected by the <a href="../cathen/01640a.htm">Apostolic Letter</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 27 September, 1850), which restored a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It comprises the counties of Oxford, Stafford, Warwick, and <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>. It take sits name from the municipal city of Birmingham in Warwickshire, the largest town of the four countries. Previous to 1850, these same four counties were included, first in the Midland, then in the Central, District or Vicariate, which had been governed by Vicars-Apostolic since 1688, of whom by far the most illustrious was <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Bishop Milner</a> (1803 -26)&mdash;a man equally learned in polemics, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, and sacred arch&aelig;ology. To his untiring energies and undaunted front against a strongly organized <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> opposition, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> owes its present stability and its solid <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity. Under <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Milner</a>, whose episcopal residence was at Wolverhampton (Staffordshire), this vicariate became the starting-point and then the centre of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Movement, or Revival, in the last century (1800-50). Its prominence as well as its lustre was due not merely to its central position, but chiefly to <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Milner's</a> brilliant talents, his magnetic influence, and clear foresight. Its two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> &mdash; Sedgley Park School, Wolverhampton, and St. Mary's College, Oscott, Birmingham &mdash; presided over and staffed by exceptionally able men, lent their aid also to this great movement by supplying a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> body of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> thoroughly grounded in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles. When, later on, the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford movement</a> led to so many conversions, Oscott College became the rallying point for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> forces, inasmuch as its then president, <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Bishop Wiseman</a> (1840-17), was the acknowledged leader and interpreter. To Oscott <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">John Henry Newman</a> had come from Littlemore after his reception into the church, and many other distinguished converts besides.

<p>The last vicar-Apostolic of this henceforth historic vicariate was <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">William Bernard Ullathorne, O.S.B.</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 21 June, 1846. After ruling the Western Vicariate for a short time he was translated to the Central District, to become the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the newly created See of Birmingham. Next to <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a>, he had done most to promote the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. On 27 October, 1850, <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Bishop Ullathorne</a> was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in St. Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham, when <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Dr. Newman</a> preached his celebrated sermon "Christ on the Waters", second only to the "Second Spring" delivered at the First Provincial Synod of Westminster at Oscott (July, 1852). The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> house had been erected in Bishop Walsh's vicariate (21 June, 1840) from designs drawn by <a href="../cathen/12558b.htm">Augustus Welby Pugin</a>, the foremost promoter of the revival of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>, who, through the munificence of John, 16th Earl of <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, adorned the diocese with many <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings. Over the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of St. Chad's Cathedral rest the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of its patron which had been enshrined till the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in Lichfield Cathedral. On 24 June, 1852, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, consisting of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and ten canons, was duly erected, to which three honorary canons have since been added. The first and third provosts, respectively, were <a href="../cathen/15575a.htm">Mgr. Weedall, D.D.</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11111a.htm">Dr. Northcote</a>, both presidents of Oscott. The first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was held 9 and 10 November, 1853, since which time there have been thirteen other <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> (1853-1906). In 1873, owing to refusal to renew the lease, Sedgley Park School was transferred to St. Wilfrid's, Cotton, Staffordshire, formerly the residence of Father Faber and the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>. In the October of the same year St. Bernard's <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> Seminary was opened at Olton, Warwickshire, of which the first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was the Rev. Edward Ilsley, successively canon and bishop-auxiliary (December 4, 1879).

<p>In July, 1879, <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Bishop Ullathorne</a> resigned, becoming titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03125d.htm">Cabasa</a>. He retired to Oscott, where he died 21 March, 1889. Two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> stand forth conspicuous in the history of the Birmingham diocese whose relations with <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Bishop Ullathorne</a> were exceptionally close. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> and <a href="../cathen/07118a.htm">Mother Margaret Hallahan</a>. The former lived and died at the oratory, Edgbaston, Birmingham, and the new basilica opened 9 October, 1906, will perpetuate his memory. The latter was the foundress of the English Congregation of Nuns of the Third <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, who have <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Stoke on Trent and Stone. The latter is the burying place both of <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Archbishop Ullathorne</a> and Mother Margaret. The large number of communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who have found a home in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> attracted by the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Bishop Ullathorne</a> include <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> (2 <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a>), <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> and of <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">St. Paul</a> &mdash; the latter introduced from <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> by Mother Genevieve Dupuis. Another religious force, specially characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, has been the annual reunions in the Town Hall, Birmingham, which, begun in 1855, have been presided over by eminent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and have tended to keep the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> in touch with one another. Mention, too, must be made of John Hardman of Birmingham, whose firm has done so much in promoting ecclesiastical art, notably <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained-glass</a> and metal work, and whose benefactions to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> choir have enabled it to reach a standard of excellence in <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> which places it first among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> choirs. On 17 February, 1888, Dr. Ilsley became the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Birmingham, and at once took in hand the difficult task of protecting and rescuing the destitute <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. St. Edward's Home for homeless boys was opened at Coleshill (Warwickshire), 6 November, 1906, with branch houses for boys and girls, similarly situated, in various centres, besides a Home for Working Boys and a Night Refuge, both in Birmingham. In July, 1889, Oscott College was closed to lay students and reopened as a Central Seminary for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> only. The progress of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> since 1850 is gauged by a comparison of a few statistics from the years 1851 and 1906, respectively: <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 124 and 297; <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 82 and 189; <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, 19 and 97.
