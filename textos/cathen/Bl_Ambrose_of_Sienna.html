<h1>Bl. Ambrose of Sienna</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienna</a>, 16 April, 1220, of the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Sansedoni; d. at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienna</a>, in 1286. When about one year old, Ambrose was cured of a congenital deformity, in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Mary Magdalene. As a child and youth he was noted for his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of charity, exercised especially towards <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, the sick in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. He entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in his native city at the age of seventeen, was sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to continue his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies under <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a>, and had for a fellow-student there <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. In 1248 he was sent with <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> to Cologne where he taught in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In 1260 he was one of the band of missionaries who evangelized <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. In 1266 Sienna was put under an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> for having espoused the cause of the <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, then at enmity with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siennese</a> petitioned Ambrose to plead their cause before the Sovereign Pontiff, and so successfully did he do this that he obtained for his native city full pardon and a renewal of all her privileges. The <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siennese</a> soon cast off their allegiance; a second time Ambrose obtained pardon for them. He brought about a reconciliation between Emperor Conrad of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Pope Clement IV</a>. About his time he was chosen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his native city, but he declined the office. For a time, he devoted himself to preaching the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>; and later, at the request of <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Pope Gregory X</a>, caused the studies which the late <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> had practically suspended to be resumed in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After the death of <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Pope Gregory X</a> he retired to one of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of his order, whence he was summoned by <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a> and sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. He restored peace between <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and also between Florence and <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. His name was inserted in the Roman Martyrology in 1577. His biographers exhibit his life as one of perfect <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> poetry, and many legends are told of victories over carnal <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. He was renowned as an apostolic preacher. His oratory, simple rather than elegant, was most convincing and effective. His sermons, although once collected, are not now extant.
