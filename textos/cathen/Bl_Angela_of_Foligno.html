<h1>Bl. Angela of Foligno</h1>  

<p>Umbrian penitent and <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical</a> writer. She was born at <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a> in Umbria, in 1248, of a rich <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; died 4 January, 1309. Married at an early age, she <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the world and its pleasures and, worse still, forgetful of her dignity and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as wife and mother, fell into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and led a disorderly life. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having in His mercy inspired her with a deep sorrow for her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, led her little by little to the height of perfection and to the understanding of the deepest mysteries. Angela has herself recorded the history of her <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> in her admirable "Book of Visions and Instructions", which contains seventy chapters, and which was written from Angela's dictation by her <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> confessor, Father Arnold of <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a>. Some time after her <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> Angela had placed herself under the direction of Father Arnold and taken the habit of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the fame of her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> gathered around her a number of Tertiaries, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who strove under her direction to advance in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Later she established at <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a> a community of sisters, who to the Rule of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> added the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion, without, however, binding themselves to enclosure, so that they might devote their time to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. Angela at last passed away, surrounded by her spiritual children. Her remains repose in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Francis at <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a>. Numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were worked at her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> approved the immemorial veneration paid to her. Her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept in the Order on the 30th of March. Bl. Angela's high authority as a spiritual teacher may be gathered from the fact that Bollandus, among other testimonials, quotes Maximilian Sandaeus, of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, who calls her the "Mistress of Theologians", whose whole <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> has been drawn out of the Book of Life, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ, Our Lord</a>.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The life of Blessed Angela has been written by Mariano of Florence and Marx of Lisbon in their chronicles; also by Jacobill, Vite de' Santi e Beati dell' Umbria, and Wadding, Annales Minorum. These writers have principally derived their information from her Book of Visions and Instructions. The editio princeps of this book, known as the Theology of the Cross (Paris, 1598) remains the chief source for her life and teaching. B. Angel&aelig; de Fulgineo Visionum et Instructionum Liber (reprinted Cologne, 1601) was reedited by Bollandus, Acta Sanctorum, I, Jan., 186-234; by Lammertz with German tr. (Cologne, 1851); and Faloci Pulignani (Foligno, 1899); the English translation by Cruikshank (Derby, 1872) has been lately re-issued (New York, 1903). See also Lives of the Saints and Blessed of the Three Orders of St. Francis (Taunton, 1887), I, 536-554.</p></div>
