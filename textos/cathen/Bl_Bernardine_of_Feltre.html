<h1>Bl. Bernardine of Feltre</h1>  

<a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a> and missionary, b. at Feltre, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in 1439 and d. at <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, 28 September, 1494. He belonged to the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Tomitano and was the eldest of nine children. In 1456 <a href="../cathen/08278b.htm">St. James of the Marches</a> preached the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> course at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and inspired to enter the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> order, Bernardine was clothed with the habit of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> in May of the same year. He completed successfully his studies at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1463. Cured <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> of an impediment in his speech, Bernardine began the long and fruitful apostolate which has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be ranked as one of the greatest <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries of the fifteenth century. Every city of note and every province from <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> in the north to <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> and the provinces of the south became successively the scene of his missionary labours; and the fruits of his apostolate were both marvellous and enduring. Bernardine, however, will be best remembered in connexion with the <em><a href="../cathen/10534d.htm">monti di piet&agrave;</a></em> of which he was the reorganizer and, in a certain sense, the founder. The word <em>mons</em> which literally means an accumulation of wealth or money, now called capital, seems to have been a generic term used in the fifteenth century to signify lending-houses in general; and hence the <em>montes pietatis</em> or <em><a href="../cathen/10534d.htm">monti di piet&agrave;</a></em> were a species of charitable lending-establishments not, perhaps, unlike our modern pawnbrokers' establishments, but possessing, of course, none of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">sinister</a> features of the latter. As originally instituted the <em><a href="../cathen/10534d.htm">monti di piet&agrave;</a></em> were intended as a timely and effectual remedy for the evils occasioned by the <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> then practiced by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> upon the people of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; and Blessed Bernardine's places where they had not previously existed afford an explanation of the fact that he is generally represented carrying in his hand a <em><a href="../cathen/10534d.htm">monte di piet&agrave;</a></em>, that is, a little green hill composed of three mounds and on the top either a cross or a standard with the inscription: <em>Curam illius habe</em>. As an author Bernardine has left us little if anything of importance, but it is interesting to note that the authorship of the well-known <em>Anima Christi</em> has as often as not been ascribed to Blessed Bernardine of Feltre. The fact, however, that the <em>Anima Christi</em> was composed sometime before the birth of Blessed Bernardine disproves any claim that he might have of being its author. As in the case of St. Ignatius, Bernardine also made frequent use of it and recommended it to his brethren. The feast of Blessed Bernardino is kept in the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a> on the 28th of September. (See MONTI DI PIET&Agrave;).
