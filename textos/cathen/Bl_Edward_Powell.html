<h1>Bl. Edward Powell</h1>  

<p>With <a href="../cathen/14659b.htm">Blessed Thomas Abel</a> there suffered Edward Powell, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, b. in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> about 1478; M.A. Oxon.; Fellow of Oriel, 1495; D.D. 26 June, 1506 and styled <em>perdoctus vir</em> by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Bleadon, Somerset, and <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendary</a> of Centum Solidorum in Lincoln, which he exchanged for Carlton-cum-Thurlby in 1505, and the latter for Sutton-in-Marisco in 1525. He also held the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> of Lyme Regis, Calstock, Bedminster, and St. Mary Redcliffe, <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a>, and the living of St. Edmond's Salisbury. A court preacher in high favour with <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, he was ordered to publish a reply to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> ("Propugnaculum summi Sacerdotii Evangelici, ac septem Sacramentorum, aeditum per virum eruditum, sacrarum literarum professorem Edoardum Poelum adversus Maratinum Lutherum fratrem famosum et Wiclifistan insignem", London, 1523, three books in the form of a dialogue between Powell and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>). The <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a> commended this work, and styled Powell "the glory of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>" in a letter to the king. Powell was one of the four <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> selected to defend the legality of the marriage of Catherine of Aragon, in connection with which he wrote the very rare "Tractatus de non dissolvendo Henrici Regis cum Catherina matrimonio" (London).

<p>In March, 1533, Powell was selected to answer Latimer at <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a>, and was alleged to have disparaged his moral character. Latimer complained to Cromwell, and Powell fell into further disfavour by denouncing Henry's marriage with Anne Boleyn. He was discharged from the proctorship of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> in Jan., 1534, and in November he was <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">attainted</a>, together with <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Blessed John Fisher</a>, for high treason in refusing to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of succession, deprived of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Tower of London. His confinement was very rigorous; the keeper himself was sent to the Marshalsea Prison for allowing Powell and Abel out on bail. The sentence was not carried out until 30 July, 1540. Three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (Powell, <a href="../cathen/14659b.htm">Abel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13044a.htm">Richard Featherstone</a>) and three <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> suffered together. The victims were dragged on hurdles from the Tower to Smithfield, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> on each hurdle. Powell's companion was Robert Barnes, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> divine. A dialogue in verse was published shortly after, "The Metynge of Doctor Barnes and Dr. Powell at Paradise Gate and of theyre communicacion bothe drawen to Smithfylde fro the Towar" (London, 1540), in the British Museum. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were hanged, drawn, and quartered as traitors; the others were burned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.
