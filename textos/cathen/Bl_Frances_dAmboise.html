<h1>Bl. Frances d'Amboise</h1>  

<p>Duchess of Brittany, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, b. 1427; d. at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, 4 Nov., 1485. The daughter of Louis d'Amboise, Viscount de Thouars, she was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> when only four years old, to Peter, second son of John V, Duke of Brittany, the marriage being solemnized when she had reached the age of fifteen. The union was, however, not very <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> owing to the morose disposition of the husband who occasionally ill-treated his wife; but her gentleness gradually changed his heart, he assisted her in her <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and did penance for his former dissolute life. After his succession to the dukedom in 1450 her wholesome influence made itself felt in wider circles; she also intervened, not always successfully, in the never-ending <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> feuds. The duke died, leaving no legitimate heir, in 1457 after having borne testimony in his last will to the devotedness of his wife. The latter <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> her life to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but for several years she was unable to consummate the sacrifice by entering a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. While being <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by her future mother-in-law she had early distinguished herself by <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> and fervent devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. During her married life she devoted a large portion of her fortune to the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, which she would have joined had her strength allowed it; she also took part in the preliminaries of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of St. Vincent Ferrer, became a benefactress of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, and made the acquaintance of Blessed John Soreth, General of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, who in 1452 had established the first community of <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Some of these, coming from <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, were received by Frances at <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a> (31 Oct., 1463) where they were entertained at the castle until the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> called "The Three Maries" was habitable. Having provided their dowries she entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> (25 March, 1468), making her profession the following year. After some time spent as infirmarian she was elected <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a> for life (1473), and became by her splendid example the model of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, and, in a sense, the foundress of this branch of the order. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> proving too small she obtained not without litigation, a larger one at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>. She died in a <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">holy ecstasy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought at her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French revolution</a> her body had to be saved twice from <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">profanation</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> her 16 July, 1863.
