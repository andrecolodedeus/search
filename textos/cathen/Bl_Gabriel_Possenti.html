<h1>Bl. Gabriel Possenti</h1>  

<p>Passionist student; renowned for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; born at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, 1 March, 1838; died 27 February, 1862, at Isola di Gran Sasso, Province of Abruzzo, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; son of Sante Possenti and Agnes Frisciotti; received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> on the day of his birth and was called Francesco, the name by which he was known before entering religion, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers'</a> School, and at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. Immediately after the completion of his secular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, he embraced the religious state; on 21 September, 1856 he was clothed with the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> habit, and received the name of <em>Gabriele dell' Addolorata.</em> He made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> on 22 September, 1857, and then began his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies as a <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> student. He was gifted with talent of a higher order and with a wonderful memory; and in his exact observance of rule, his spirit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and his fervent devotion to the Passion of our Lord, to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, and to the Dolours of the Blessed Virgin. In the sixth year of his <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> he died of consumption; his death was that of the just, holy and edifying, and he was buried in the church attached to the retreat at Isola di Gran Sasso where his remains are still entombed, and where numerous prodigies have been wrought, and numerous conversions effected, through his intercession.

<p>Little was known of Gabriel's extraordinary spiritual gifts during his life. He was not singular, he conformed himself to the community life; he was only a fervent and exemplary <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> and student hidden from the world in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. After death, this young religious in a few years was declared venerable by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, thereby testifying that he had practised all the virtues in a heroic degree; and he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> and raised to the honours of the altar, by special privilege of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a> before he was fifty years dead.

<p>His solemn <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> took place on 31 May, 1908, in the Vatican basilica, in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> then in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> fathers resident in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and of representatives from all the provinces of the congregation. Among those present were many who had known the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> during his life, including one of his brothers, Father Norbert, C.P., his old <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> and confessor and Signor Dominico Tiberi, who had been <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> cured through his intercession. [<em>Editor's Note:</em> Gabriel was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in May of 1920.]

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> and <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Blessed Gabriel are allowed to the whole <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a> congregation, and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is celebrated on 31 May. It is the express wish of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> that he should be regarded as the chief patron of the youth of today, and especially as the patron of young religious, both <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and professed, in all that concerns their interior lives.
