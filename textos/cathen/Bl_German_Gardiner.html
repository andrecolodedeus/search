<h1>Bl. German Gardiner</h1>  

<p>Last <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died at Tyburn, 7 March, 1544; secretary to, and probably a kinsmen of, Stephen Gardiner, and an able defender of the old <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, as his tract against John Frith (dated 1 August, 1534) shows. During the years of fiery trial, which followed, we hear no more of him than that "he was stirred up to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>" by the examples of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and especially by <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More</a>, a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> like himself. His witness was given eight years later, under remarkable circumstances. <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> was becoming more severe upon the fast-multiplying <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Canmer fell under suspicion, and Gardiner was (or was thought to have been) employed in drawing up a list of that heresiarch's <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Then the whim of the religious despot changed again, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> was sacrificed in the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic's</a> place. Still he was the last victim, and Henry afterwards became even more hostile to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Gardiner's indictment states plainly that he was executed for endeavouring "to deprive the King of his dignity, title, and name of Supreme Head of the English and Irish Church", and his constancy is further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by this circumstance, that Thomas Haywood, who had been condemned with him, was afterward pardoned on recanting his opinions. His other companions at the bar were <a href="../cathen/08466b.htm">Blessed John Larke</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Blessed Thomas More</a> had presented to the rectory of Chelsea (when he himself lived in that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>), and also the Ven. John Ireland, who had once been <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More's</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. They suffered the death of <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">traitors</a> at Tyburn.
