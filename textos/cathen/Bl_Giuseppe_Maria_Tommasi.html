<h1>Bl. Giuseppe Maria Tommasi</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, noted for his learning, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for reform; born at Licata, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, of a princely <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, 12 September, 1649; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1 January 1713. Though destined by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> for the Spanish Court, he joined the <a href="../cathen/04051d.htm">Clerks Regular</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, 24 March, 1665, renouncing his primogeniture and the princedom in favour of his brother. He was <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a> 25 March, 1666. He studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, first at <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a>, and later, owing to poor health, at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> and <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>; and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Palermo. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 1673. To a wide <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek, he united the study of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a>, Arabic, Syriac, Chaldaic and Hebrew--converting his master a Jewish rabbi, to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. From the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalters</a> in these different languages, he collected the titles of the Psalms. He devoted himself to the study of Scripture and the Fathers. Searching the chief <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, archives, and monuments, he retraced the ancient <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and liturgy.

<p>His valuable works (<em>Codici Tommasiani</em>), published chiefly from ancient <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> in the Vatican and Vallicellian Libraries and the Library of Christina of Sweden, were highly praised by the different academies of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, even <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. Chief among his publications are the "Codices sacramentorum nongentis annis antiquiores" (Rome, 1680), partly transcribed by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> in his "Liturgia Gallicana". Following these, in order of time, were: "Psalterium" (Rouse, 1683), according to the Roman and Gallican editions, published under the name of Giuseppe Maria Caro". In this work Tommasi introduced <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> symbols (obeli and asterisks), obsolete for nine centuries. Under the same pen-name Tommasi wrote "Responsalia et Antiphonaria Rom. Eccl.", etc (Rome, 1686); "Sacrorum Bibliorum Tituli, sive capitula" (Rome, 1688); Antiqui libri Missarum Rom. Eccl." or the <a href="../cathen/01579a.htm">Antiphonary of Pope Saint Gregory</a>, entitled "Comes", written by <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> at the order of Charlemagae (Rome, 1691); "Officium Domicinae Passionis", used by the Greeks on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, translated into Latin (Rome, 1695). Under his proper name he published "Speculum" (Rome, 1679); "Exercitium Fidei, Spei et Caritatis" (Rome, 1683); "Breviarium psalterii (Rome, 1683); "Vera norma di glorificar Dio" (Rome, 1687); "Fermentum" (Rome, 1688); "Psalterium cum canticis" (Rome, 1697); "Indiculus institutionum theologicarum veterurn Patrum" (3 vols., Rome, 1709, 1710; 1712), an exposition of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> theory and practice, derived from original patristic sources. Tommasi also wrote numerous <em>opuscula</em>, the last four published by G. Mercati (Rome, 1905). In 1753 <a href="../cathen/15397a.htm">Vezzosi</a> published his works in eleven quarto volumes.

<p>Tommasi's efforts at reform were directed not to the introduction of the new, but to the restoration and maintenance of the old. He was not always upheld and was sometimes rebuked for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> made him examiner of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> appointed him consultor of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine Order</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the "Congregatio super Disciplin&acirc; Regulari" and other Congregations, consultor of the Congregations of Rites and Indulgences, and <em>qualificator</em> of the Holy Office. The same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> of the Title of S. Martino ai Monti and compelled him to accept the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Taking <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> for his model, Tommasi practised <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and charity towards the poor. He taught <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> to the children of the poor in his titular church. He introduced the use of <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a> in his church. On his death he was mourned by all, even by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who so admired his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> that he consulted him before accepting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, 5 June, 1803. Every year the Arcadians hold a religious and literary commemoration in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. His body rests in the church of S. Martino ai Monti.
