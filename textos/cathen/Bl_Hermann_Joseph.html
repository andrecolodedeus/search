<h1>Bl. Hermann Joseph</h1>  

<p>Premonstratensian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and mystic; b. at Cologne about 1150; d. at Hoven, 7 April, 1241. According to the biography by Razo Bonvisinus, contemporary <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Steinfeld (Acta SS., 7 April, I, 679), Hermann was the son of poor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who had once been rich. At the age of seven he attended <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and very early he began the tender <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a> for which he was known during his entire life. At every available moment he could be found at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Mary on the Capitol, where he would kneel wrapt in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and child-like appeal to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>. One day he is said to have presented an apple, saved from his own scanty repast, to the Child Who accepted it. According to still another legend, on another occasion, when on a bitter cold day he made his appearance with bare feet, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> procured him the means of getting shoes. At the age of twelve he entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> or <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Canons at Steinfeld, in the present <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Rhenish Prussia</a>, made his studies in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, and on his return was entrusted with the service of the refectory and later of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>.

<p>After he had been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, it was remarkable with what reverence and devotion he offered the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. He was known for his gentle demeanour and affability, his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, his extraordinary <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a>, but, above all, for his affection for the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, before whose altar he remained for hours in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pious intercourse</a> and <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">ecstatic visions</a>, and in whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> he composed wonderful <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, in turn, showed him her predilection, called him her <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and her spouse, and confirmed his surname Joseph, given to him by his brothers in religion. Hermann was sometimes sent out to perform pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and was in frequent demand for the making and repairing of clocks. He had under his charge the spiritual welfare of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Hoven near Zulpich. Here he died and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. His body was later transferred to Steinfeld, where his marble <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> and large picture may be seen to the present day; portions of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are at Cologne and at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. He is represented in art as kneeling before a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Virgin and Child and offering an apple. The process of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> was begun in 1626, at the request of Archbishop Ferdinand of Cologne and the Emperor Ferdinand II, but was interrupted. His feast was, however, celebrated on 7 April, and the name of Blessed Hermann is in the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> supplement to the Roman Martyrology. They also celebrate the translation of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> on 24 May. His works are: "A Commentary on the Canticle of Canticles", which is lost; "Opuscula" (new edition, Namur, 1899), including: "Duodecim gratiarum actiones"; "Jubilus seu Hymnus de SS. undecim millibus Virginibus"; "Oratio ad Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum", taken to a great extent from the Canticle of Canticles; "Alia Oratio"; "Precula de quinque Gaudiis B. Mariae V." It is not quite certain whether the last three are the works of Hermann, though they are generally ascribed to him.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> Hermann Joseph was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Pius XII in 1958.]
