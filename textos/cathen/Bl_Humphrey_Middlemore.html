<h1>Bl. Humphrey Middlemore</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth uncertain; d. at Tyburn, London, 19 June, 1535. His father, Thomas Middlemore of Edgbaston, Warwickshire, represented one of the oldest <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in that county, and had acquired his estate at Edgbaston by marriage with the heiress of Sir Henry Edgbaston; his mother was Ann Lyttleton, of Pillaton Hall, Staffordshire. Attracted to the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian Order</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a> at the Charterhouse, London, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, and subsequently appointed to the office of <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>. Although few details of his life have come down, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he was greatly esteemed for his learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> by the prior, <a href="../cathen/08465a.htm">[Saint] John Houghton</a>, and by the community generally. In 1534 the question of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII's</a> marriage with Anne Boleyn arose to trouble conscientious <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, as the king was determined that the more prominent of his subjects should expressly acknowledge the validity of the marriage, and the right of succession of any issue therefrom. Accordingly, the royal commissions paid a visit to the Charterhouse, and required the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to that effect. <a href="../cathen/08465a.htm">Father [John] Houghton</a> and Father Humphrey refused, and were, in consequence, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Tower; but, after a month's <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, they were persuaded to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> conditionally, and were released. In the following year Father John was executed for refusing to take the new <a href="../cathen/11177a.htm">oath of supremacy</a>, and Father Humphrey became vicar of the Charterhouse. Meanwhile, Thomas Bedyll, one of the royal commissioners, had again visited the Charterhouse, and endeavoured, both by conversation and writing, to shake the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Father Humphrey and his community in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy. His efforts left them unmoved, and, after expostulating with them in a violent manner, he obtained authority from Thomas Cromwell to arrest the vicar and two other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> [<a href="../cathen/13668b.htm">Blessed Sebastian Newdigate</a> and <a href="../cathen/15630c.htm">Blessed William Exmew</a>], and throw them into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where they were treated with inhuman cruelty, being bound to posts with chains round their necks and legs, and compelled so to remain day and night for two weeks. They were then brought before the council, and required to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Not only did they refuse, but justified their attitude by able arguments from Scripture and the Fathers in favour of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims. They were accordingly condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, and suffered at Tyburn with the greatest <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and resignation.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> Humphrey Middlemore, <a href="../cathen/13668b.htm">Sebastian Newdigate</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15630c.htm">William Exmew</a> were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> in 1886. <a href="../cathen/08465a.htm">John Houghton</a> was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Paul VI in 1970 among the Forty Martyrs of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, whose joint <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is kept on 25 October.]
