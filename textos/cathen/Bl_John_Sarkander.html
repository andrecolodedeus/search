<h1>Bl. John Sarkander</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13649b.htm">seal of confession</a>, born at Skotschau in Austrian Silesia, 20 Dec., 1576; died at <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>, 17 March, 1620. In 1603 he merited the title of master of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, and after four years' study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/06733d.htm">Graz</a>. He exercised his sacred functions in several places in the <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Diocese of Olm&uuml;tz</a>, and was made <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (1613) of Boskowitz, and (1616) of Holeschau in <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>. Since the fifteenth century the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> (or United) Brethren had spread rapidly and taken possession of the churches and institutions of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but when (1604) Ladislaus Poppel of Lobkowitz bought the estates of Holleschau, he gave the church to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and made a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> out of the house occupied by the <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a>. With the aid of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, John Sarkander converted two hundred and fifty of the strayed sheep, but thereby drew upon himself the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the neighbouring landlord, Bitowsky of Bistritz. In 1618 the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> took control of <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, and John left Holleschau, made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the shrine of Our Lady of Czentoschau and passed a few weeks of retreat with the Minims, who had a house there. He spent some months at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Krakow</a> and (1619) returned to Holleschau. In February of the following year the Polish auxiliary troops sent to the emperor by King Sigismund, passed through Moravia and committed many depredations on the lands of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, but spared Holleschau when John met them with the Blessed sacrament in his hands. Bitowsky threw suspicions upon John Sarkander as if he, in conspiracy with Lobkowitz, had brought the enemy into the territory. John was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and brought to Olm&uuml;tz. The commission appointed for the trial was made up entirely of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> city judge Johann Scintilla was forced to attend. He made a report of the whole transaction to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Franz Cardinal von Dietrichstein (1625). The questions put were: who had called the troops into the country; what underhand dealings John had practiced in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; what had been confided to him by Lobkowitz, whose confessor he was, and whose secret plans he therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. Because John would not violate the secrets of the holy tribunal the rack was used on 13, 17 and 18 February. On each of the latter days the torture lasted for two and three hours, lighted candles and feathers soaked in oil, pitch, and sulphur were strewn over his body and ignited. He lingered from the effects for a month and died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. The people immediately began to venerate John Sarkander and to ask for his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>. The process was opened under <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> but was interrupted. It was brought to a close by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who pronounced the solemn <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> 6 May, 1860. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are in an altar dedicated to his name in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>.
