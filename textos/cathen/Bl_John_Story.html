<h1>Bl. John Story</h1>  

<p>(<em>Or</em> Storey.)

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>; born 1504; died at Tyburn, 1 June, 1571. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, and was president of Broadgates Hall, now Pembroke <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a>, from 1537 to 1539. He entered Parliament as member for Hindon, Wilts, in 1547, and was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for opposing the Bill of Uniformity, 24 Jan.-2 March, 1548-9. On his release he retired with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, but after the <a href="../cathen/01095a.htm">accession</a> of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (Aug., 1553), and became chancellor to <a href="../cathen/02675a.htm">Bishop Bonner</a>. From 1553 to 1560 he sat for one or other parliamentary division of Wiltshire, and in the latter year he incurred the displeasure of Elizabeth for his outspoken opposition to the Bill of Supremacy. He was committed to the Fleet, 20 May, 1560, but escaped, was re-arrested and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Marshalsea (1563). He once more made good his escape to <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, where he renounced his English allegiance and became a Spanish subject. Under the <a href="../cathen/01371a.htm">Duke of Alva</a> he held a position in the customs of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> until August, 1570, when he was kidnapped at Bergen-op-Zoon by Cecil's agents. He was brought to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Tower, where he was frequently racked, and on 26 May, 1571, he was indicted in Westminster Hall for having conspired against the queen's life and for having while at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> assisted the Northern rebels. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">saintly</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> bore his tortures with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, asserted over and over his innocence of the charges, but refused to make any further plea, on the ground that he was a Spanish subject, and that consequently his judges had no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The spectacle of this trial moved <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Edmund Campion</a>, who was present in the Hall, to reconsider his own position and opened his eyes to his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Blessed John Story was condemned 27 May, and spent his last night in the Tower, preparing for a death which his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> made as barbarously cruel as it was possible.
