<h1>Bl. Marie de l'Incarnation</h1>  

<p>Known also as Madame Acarie, foundress of the French Carmel, born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1 February, 1566; died at Pontoise, April, 1618. By her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> Barbara Avrillot belonged to the higher bourgeois <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Her father, Nicholas Avrillot was accountant general in the Chamber of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and chancellor of Marguerite of Navarre, first wife of Henri IV; while her mother, Marie Lhuillier was a descendant of Etienne Marcel, the famous <em>pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t des marchands</em> (chief municipal magistrate). She was placed with the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> of Longchamp for her <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and acquired there a vocation for the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, which subsequent life in the world did not alter. In 1684, through obedience she married Pierre Acarie, a wealthy young man of high standing, who was a fervent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, to whom she bore six children. She was an exemplary wife and mother.

<p>Pierre Acarie was one of the staunchest members of the League, which, after the death of Henry III, opposed the succession of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> prince, <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, to the French throne. He was one of the sixteen who organized the resistance in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The cruel famine, which accompanied the siege of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, gave Madame Acarie an occasion of displaying her charity. After the dissolution of the League, brought about by the <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> of Henry IV, Acarie was exiled from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and his wife had to remain behind to contend with creditors and business men for her children's fortune, which had been compromised by her husband's want of foresight and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. In addition she was afflicted with physical sufferings, the consequences of a fall from her horse, and a very severe course of treatment left her an invalid for the rest of her life.

<p>At the beginning of the seventeenth century Madame Acarie was widely known for her virtue, her <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a>, and especially her charity towards the poor and the sick in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. To her residence came all the distinguished and devout people of the day in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, among them Mme de Meignelay, n&eacute;e de Gondi, a model of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, Mme Jourdain and Mme de Br&eacute;aut&eacute;, future <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, the Chancellor de Merillac, P&egrave;re Coton the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, St. Vincent of Paul, and St. Francis of Sales, who for six months was Mme Acarie's director. The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had been living thus retired from the world, but sought by chosen <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, when, toward the end of 1601, there appeared a French translation of Ribera's life of St. Teresa. The translator, Abb&eacute; de Br&eacute;tigny, was known to her. She had some portions of the work read to her. A few days later St. Teresa, appeared to her and informed her that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wished to make use of her to found <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The apparitions continuing, Mme Acarie took counsel and began the work. Mlle de Longueville wishing to defray the cost of erecting the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, in Rue St. Jacques, Henry IV granted letters patent, 18 July, 1602. A meeting in which <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">Pierre de B&eacute;rulle</a>, future founder of the Oratory, St. Francis of Sales, Abb&eacute; de Br&eacute;tigny, and the Marillacs took part, decided on the foundation of the "Reformed Carmel in France", 27 July, 1602. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to obtain the authorization, and <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> granted the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of institution, 23 November, 1603. The following year some <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> were received into the Carmel of Rue St. Jacques, which became celebrated. Mme de Longueville, Anne de Gonzague, Mlle de la Vallieres, withdrew to it; there also <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> were to preach. The Carmel spread rapidly and profoundly influenced French <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the day. In 1618, the year of Mme Acarie's death, it numbered fourteen houses.

<p>Mme Acarie also shared in two foundations of the day, that of the Oratory and that of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>. She urged <a href="../cathen/02524b.htm">De B&eacute;rulle</a> to refuse the tutorship of Louis XIII, and on 11 November, 1611 she, with <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, assisted at the Mass of the installation of the Oratory of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Among the many <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> whom Mme Acarie received for the Carmel, there were some who had no vocation, and she conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of getting them to undertake the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young girls, and broached her plan to her holy cousin, Mme. de Sainte-Beuve. To establish the new order they brought <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and adopted their rule and name. M. Acarie having died in 1613, his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> settled her affairs and begged leave to enter the Carmel, asking as a favour to be received as a lay sister in the poorest community. In 1614 she withdrew to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, taking the name of Marie de l'Incarnation. Her three daughters had preceded her into the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, and one of them was sub-prioress at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>. In 1616, by order of her superiors, she went to the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Pontoise, where she died. Her cause was introduced at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1627; she was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a>, 24 April, 1791; her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> on 18 April.
