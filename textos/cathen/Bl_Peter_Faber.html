<h1>Bl. Peter Faber</h1>  

<p>Born 13 April, 1506, at Villaret, <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>; died 1 Aug., 1546, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As a child he tended his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> sheep during the week, and on Sunday he taught <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> to other children. The instinctive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his vocation as an apostle inspired him with a desire to study. At first he was entrusted to the care of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Th&ocirc;nes, and then to a neighbouring <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Although without any defininte plans for the future, he resolved to go to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> consented to the separation, and in 1525 Peter arrived in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Here he acquired the learning he desired, and found quite unexpectedly his real vocation. He was admitted gratuitously to the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Sainte-Barbe, and shared the lodging of a student from <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, Francis Xavier, the future saint, in a tower which still existed in 1850. They became intimately attached to each other, receiving on the same day in 1530 the degree of <a href="../cathen/01759a.htm">master of arts</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> he also met <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius of Loyola</a> and became one of his associates. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1534, and received at Montmartre, on 15 August of the same year, the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of Ignatius and his five companions. To these first six volunteers, three others were to attach themselves. Ignatius appointed them all to meet at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and charged Faber to conduct them there. Leaving <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 15 Nov., 1536, Faber and his companions rejoined Ignatius at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in Jan., 1537. Ignatius then thought of going to evangelize the Holy Land, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had destined him for a vaster field of action.

<p>After Ignatius, Faber was the one whom Xavier and his companions esteemed the most eminent. He merited this esteem by his profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, his gentle <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and his influence over <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Faber now repaired to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and after some months of preaching and teaching, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent him to <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, where he brought about a revival of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Faber was sent to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to uphold <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> at the Diet of Worms. In reality the diets which the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were enabled to hold through the weakness of Charles accomplished no good. From the Diet of Worms, convoked in 1540, he was called to that of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1541. Faber was startled by the ruin which <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> had caused in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and by the state of decadence presented by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; and he saw that the remedy did not lie in discussions with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but in the reform of the faithful &mdash; above all, of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. For ten months, at <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, he conducted himself with gentleness and success. It was above all by the Spiritual that he accomplished most of his conversions. Princes, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> revealed their consciences to him, and people were astounded by the efficacy of an apostolate accomplished so rapidly. Recalled to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by St. Ignatius, Faber tore himself away from the field where he had already gathered such a harvest, and won <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, which has never ceased to venerate him as a saint; but he had hardly been in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> six months when by order of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he was again sent to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. This time for nineteen months Faber was to work for the reform of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and Cologne &mdash; a thankless task. However, he gained the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> little by little, changed their hearts, and discovered in the young many vocations. That he decided the vocation of Bl. Peter Canisius is in itself sufficient to justify his being called the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Herman of Wied, was already won over by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which he was later publicly to embrace. It was also at Cologne that Faber especially exercised his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. After spending some months at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, in 1543, where he implanted the seeds of numerous vocations among the young, he returned to <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and there it may be said that he extirpated all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. But he was forced by obedience to leave <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in August, 1544, going at first to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, later to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. At the court of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and that of Valladolid, Faber was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel of God</a>. He was called to the principal cities of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and everywhere inculcated fervour and fostered vocations. Let it suffice to mention that of <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">Francis Borgia</a>, which he, more than anyone else, was the means of strengthening. Faber, at forty, was wasted by his incessant labours and his unceasing journeys always made on foot. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, thought of sending him to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; John III wanted him to be made <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>. Called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Faber, weakened by fever, arrived there 17 July, 1546, to die in the arms of St. Ignatius, the first of the following August. Those who had known him already invoked him as a saint. <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">Saint Francis de Sales</a>, whose character recalled that of Faber's, never spoke of him except as a saint. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a>, 5 September, 1872; his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 8 August.
