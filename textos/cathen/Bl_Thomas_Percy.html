<h1>Bl. Thomas Percy</h1>  

<p>Earl of Northumberland, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, born in 1528; died at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, 22 August, 1572. He was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Percy, brother of the childless Henry Percy, sixth Earl of Northumberland, and Eleanor, daughter of Sir Guiscard Harbottal. When Thomas was eight years old his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was executed at Tyburn (2 June, 1537) for having taken a leading part in the <a href="../cathen/12084b.htm">Pilgrimage of Grace</a>, and he also is considered a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> by many. Thomas and his brother Henry were then removed from their mother's keeping and entrusted to Sir Thomas Tempest.

<p>In 1549, when Thomas Percy came of age, an Act was passed "for the restitution in blood of Mr. Thomas Percy". Shortly afterwards he was knighted, and, three years later, in <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary's</a> reign, he regained his ancestral honours and lands. Declared governor of Prudhoe Castle he besieged and took Scarborough Castle, which was seized by rebels in 1557. In reward the Earldom of Northumberland together with the Baronies of Percy, Poynings, Lucy, Bryan, and Fitzpane were restored to him. He was installed at Whitehall with great pomp, and soon after was named Warden General of the Marches, in which capacity he fought and defeated the Scots. In 1558 he married Anne Somerset, daughter of the Earl of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, a valiant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who subsequently suffered much for the Faith.

<p>On Elizabeth's accession the earl, whose steadfast loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was known, was kept in the North while the anti-Catholic measures of Elizabeth's first Parliament were passed. Elizabeth continued to show him favour, and in 1563 gave him the Order of the Garter. He had then resigned the wardenship and was living in the South. But the systematic <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> rendered their position most difficult, and in the autumn of 1569 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> gentry in the North, stirred up by rumours of the approaching <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of Elizabeth, were planning to liberate Mary, Queen of Scots, and obtain liberty of worship. Earl Thomas with the Earl of Westmoreland wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> asking for advice, but before their letter reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> circumstances hurried them into action against their better judgment. After a brief success the rising failed, and Thomas fled to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, where he was captured and, after three years, sold to the English Government. He was conducted to York and beheaded, refusing to save his life by abandoning his religion. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 13 May, 1895, and his festival was appointed to be observed in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham and Newcastle</a> on 14 November. His daughter Mary founded the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> from which nearly all the existing houses of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> are descended.
