<h1>Bl. Th&eacute;ophane V&eacute;nard</h1>  

<p>(JEAN-TH&Eacute;OPHANE V&Eacute;NARD.)

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> missionary, born at St-Loup, <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Diocese of Poitiers</a>, 1829; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in Tonkin, 2 February, 1861. He studied at the College of Doue-la-Fontaine, Montmorillon, <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, and at the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Seminary for Foreign Missions which he entered as a sub-deacon. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 5 June, 1852, he departed for the Far East, 19 Sept. After fifteen months at Hong Kong he arrived at his mission in West Tonkin, where the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had recently been tried by a series of persecutions under Minh-Menh, a monster of cruelty. Shortly after Father V&eacute;nard's arrival a new royal edict was issued against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to seek refuge in caves, dense woods, and elsewhere. Father V&eacute;nard, whose constitution had always been delicate, suffered almost constantly, but continued to exercise his ministry at night, and, more boldly, in broad day. On 30 November, 1860, he was betrayed and captured. Tried before a mandarin, he refused to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a> and was sentenced to be beheaded. He remained a captive until 2 February, and during this interval lived in a cage, from which he wrote to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> beautiful and consoling letters, joyful in anticipation of his crown. His <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr Retord, wrote of him at this time: "Though in chains, he is as gay as a little bird".

<p>On the way to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> Father V&eacute;nard chanted psalms and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. To his executioner, who coveted his clothing and asked what he would give to be killed promptly, he answered: "The longer it lasts the better it will be". His head, after exposure at the top of a pole, was secured by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and is now <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in Tonkin. The body rests in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> at the Missions Etrang&egrave;res, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Other precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> brother, Canon Eusebius V&eacute;nard, cur&eacute; of Assais Deux S&egrave;vres, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who possesses, also, most of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> letters, including those written from the cage. In a letter addressed to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Th&eacute;ophane refers thus to his approaching sacrifice: "A slight sabre-cut will separate my head from my body, like the spring flower which the Master of the garden gathers for His pleasure. We are all flowers planted on this earth, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> plucks in His own good time: some a little sooner, some a little later . . . Father and son may we meet in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>. I, poor little moth, go first. Adieu". The cause of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was introduced at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1879, and he was declared Blessed, 2 May, 1909. The <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> brought a large delegation from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, including the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> only surviving brother. Th&eacute;ophane V&eacute;nard was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in company with thirty-three other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, most of whom were natives of Tonkin, Cochin-China, or <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> With nineteen other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Vietnam, Th&eacute;ophane V&eacute;nard was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope John Paul II in 1988.]
