<h1>Bl. William Exmew</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> monk and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; suffered at Tyburn, 19 June, 1535. He studied at Christ's College, Cambridge, and became a proficient classical scholar. Entering the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Charterhouse, he was soon raised to the office of vicar (sub-prior); in 1534 he was named <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>. <a href="../cathen/03645b.htm">Chauncy</a> says that for virtue and learning his like could not be found in the English province of the order. Two days after the Prior of the Charterhouse, <a href="../cathen/08465a.htm">Bl. John Houghton</a>, had been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> (4 May, 1535), W. Exmew and the vicar, <a href="../cathen/07544a.htm">Humphrey Middlemore</a>, were denounced to Thomas Cromwell by Thomas Bedyll, one of the royal commissioners, as being "obstinately determined to suffer all extremities rather than to alter their opinion" with regard to the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Three weeks later they and another <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the Charterhouse, <a href="../cathen/13668b.htm">Sebastian Newdigate</a>, were arrested and thrown into the Marshalsea, where they were made to stand in chains, bound to posts, and were left in that position for thirteen days. After that, they were removed to the Tower. Named in the same indictment as <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Bl. John Fisher</a>, they were brought to trial at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, 11 June following, and pleaded not guilty, i.e., of high treason, but asserted their staunch adhesion to what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> taught on the subject of spiritual supremacy and denied that <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">King Henry VIII</a> had any right to the title of head of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>. They were consequently condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> as traitors, and were hanged, drawn, and quartered. W. Exmew is one of the fifty-four <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyrs</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 9 December, 1886.
