<h1>Bl. William Lacy</h1>  

<p>Born at "Hanton", Yorkshire (probably Houghton or Tosside, West Riding); suffered at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, 22 Aug., 1582. He married a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, named Cresswell, whose sons, Arthur and Joseph, became <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Little is related of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> by his biographers. He had a brother Ralph of Preston in Amounderness, a sister Barbara, and nephews (apparently her sons) Robert and William (Cal. S. P., Dom. add. 1566-79, London, 1871, p. 562). He held a position of emolument under the Crown, possibly as coroner, till about 1565. One of this name, probably a relative, was a corner for the West Riding in 1581-2 (Dasent, "Acts of the Privy Council", xiii, 358). After fourteen years' <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which included <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> at Hull, and after the death of his wife, he went abroad and arrived at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 22 June, 1580. On 25 September following he went on to Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, and thence to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, after obtaining a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, he became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> before <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, as Lacy had been married twice, once to a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. On 10 May, 1581, he was at Loreto on his way to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He was arrested after a Mass said by Thomas Bell, afterwards an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, in York Castle, 22 July, 1582. He suffered great hardships, being loaded with heavy irons, confined in an underground dungeon, and subjected to numerous examinations. He was arraigned on 11 August, probably under 13 Eliz. cc. 2 and 3. With him suffered Blessed Richard Kirkman, born at Addingham, in the West Riding. He arrived at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> in 1577 and, after the transference of the English College to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, 1579. On his return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in August he seems to have found a refuge with <a href="../cathen/05221a.htm">Robert Dymoke</a>, hereditary Champion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (d. in Lincoln gaol for his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, 11 Sept., 1580), at Scrivelsby, Lincolnshire. He was eventually arrested, 8 August, 1582, by Francis Wortley, J.P., and seems to have been arraigned a day or two after under 23 Eliz. c. 1. After condemnation the two <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> shared one cell in a turret till 10 August, when Blessed Richard was removed to an underground dungeon.
