<h1>Blessed Albert</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, one of the conspicuous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in the troubles between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth uncertain; died 14 September, 1215. He was in fact asked by both Pope and Emperor to act as umpire in their dispute and, as a reward, was made Prince of the Empire. He was born in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, became a canon regular in the Monastery of Mortara (not Mortura, as Butler has it) in the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a>, and after being <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, for a short time, was translated to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>. This was about 1184. At that time the Latins occupied <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and, the Patriarchate falling vacant, Albert was implored by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Palestine to accept the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. As it implied <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and a prospect of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, he accepted, and was appointed by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, who at the same time made him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Papal Legate</a>. His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> procured him the veneration of even the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Muslims</a>. It was while here that he undertook a work with which his name is particularly and peculiarly associated. In Palestine, at that time, the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of Mount Carmel lived in separate cells. One of their number gathered them into a community, and in 1209 their superior, Brocard, requested the Patriarch, though not a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, to draw up a rule for them. He assented, and legislated in the most rigorous fashion, prescribing perpetual abstinence from flesh, protracted <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, long silence, and extreme seclusion. It was so severe that mitigations had to be introduced by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> in 1246.

<p>The end of this great <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was most tragic. Summoned by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> to take part in the General Council of the Lateran, in 1215, he was assassinated before he left Palestine, while taking part in a procession, on the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. He is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, on 8 April. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> call attention to this curious anomaly, that not at <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, where he was Patriarch, not among the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a>, to whom he properly belonged, but in the Order of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, of which he was not a member, does he receive the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a saint. "That holy Order could not and ought not to lose the memory of him by whom it was ranked among the Orders approved by the Roman Church; in saying which", adds the writer, "I in no way wish to impugn the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> claim of descent from Elias." At <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> Albert does not even figure as Blessed, and the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, but pay him no public cult.
