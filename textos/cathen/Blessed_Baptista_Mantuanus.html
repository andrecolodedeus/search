<h1>Blessed Baptista Mantuanus</h1>  

<p>(Or SPAGNOLI). <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> and <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> poet, born at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, 17 April, 1447, where he also died, 22 March, 1516. The eldest son of Peter Spagnoli, a Spanish nobleman at the court of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, Baptista studied grammar under Gregorio Tifernate, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at Pavia under Polo Bagelardi. The bad example of his schoolfellows led him into irregularities. He fell into the hands of <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a> and, returning home, was turned out of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> house owing to some <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>. He went to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and later on to <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> where he carried out his resolution of entering the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> which belonged to the then flourishing Reform of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>. In a letter addressed to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> (1 April, 1464), and in his first publication, "De Vit&acirc; beat&acirc;", he gave an account of his previous life and of the motives which led him to the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>.

<p>Baptista pursued his studies at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> and Bologna where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, received his degrees, and delivered lectures in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and divinity. The Duke of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> entrusted him with the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his children, and the connection with the ducal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> resulted in a number of poetical works, the "Trophaeum Gonzagae" and the "Fortuna Gonzagae", on the various misfortunes of the young duke; "Contra amorem" containing good advice to Sigismondo Gonzaga, and other poems celebrating the latter's elevation to dignities, even to the Roman purple. Six times (each for two years with four years interval) Baptista was <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominated</a> <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a> of his congregation, and, in 1513, general of the whole order through the exertions of his former disciples, the duke and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. The chapter, however, resenting the intervention, restricted his powers. He held the office until his death, but, broken in health and energy, he exercised but little influence beyond consolidating the congregation of <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a>, a French imitation of the Mantuan Reform. Baptista Mantuanus was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1890, his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> being assigned to 23 March.

<p>Chiefly known as one of the most prolific <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> poets he excelled in almost every form of Latin verse; Virgil, however, was his favourite model. A monument represents the two poets of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> with Poetry hesitating to whom she is to offer the crown: "<em>Cui dabo?</em>" Baptista exercised too little self restraint, however, to deserve it. He was bitterly attacked concerning the good taste of his earlier works printed without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and also, but groundlessly, with reference to the legitimacy of his birth. To the end he made too free use of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> mythology.
