<h1>Blessed Berchtold</h1>  

<p>(BERTHOLD).

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Monastery of Engelberg in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. 3 November, 1197. Before becoming <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> he was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at <a href="../cathen/05429b.htm">Engelberg</a> and a favorite disciple of the learned <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Blessed Frowin. When Frowin was on the point of dying he advised his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to elect the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Berchtold as his successor. Accordingly, after Frowin's death, which occurred 27 March, 1178, Berchtold was chosen <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Following in Frowin's footsteps, he was intent on maintaining strict monastic discipline, the importance of which he inculcated by his own example. Nor did he neglect, at the same time, to encourage his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the pursuit of Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. By his order they reproduced many old writings, some of which are still extant in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of Engelberg. The more learned <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were encouraged to write original works. When Abbot Burchard openly taught that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just had gone to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>, Berchtold himself wrote "Apologia contra errorem Burchardi Abbatis S. Joannis in Thurthal seu Vallis Taurinae", in which he shows himself not only well versed in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and the writings of the Fathers but also a master in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> skill. Abbot Burchard became convinced of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, retracted, and died a saintly death. Though especially mindful of the spiritual and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> advancement of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Berchtold did not omit to provide also for the temporal welfare of Engelberg. He procured for his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> many financial privileges, among which was the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to levy <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> upon the churches of Stanz and Buochs, which were under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The contemporaneous annals of Engelberg, which are published in "Mon. Germ. Hist., SS.", XVII, 280, relate that Berchtold foretold the death of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick Barbarossa</a>. Later chronicles state that, through his blessing, the lake near Stanzstad was stocked with fish, and that shortly before his death he three times changed water into wine. He is generally represented in the act of blessing fish. His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of turning water into wine is corroborated by an epigram beneath a representation of him which was kept in the choir of Engelberg up to the seventeenth century. At Engelberg his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on the <a href="../cathen/10709a.htm">anniversary of his death</a>.
