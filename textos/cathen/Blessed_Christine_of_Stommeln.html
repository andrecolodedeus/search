<h1>Blessed Christine of Stommeln</h1>  

<p>Born at Stommeln near <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, in 1242; died 6 November, 1312.

<p>Stommeln, called in the fourteenth century Stumbeln, is situated about nine miles northwest of Cologne and about six miles west of the Rhine. Christine's father was a well-to-do peasant named Heinrich Bruso; the name of her mother was Hilla. When five years old Christine had visions of the Christ Child to whom she was mystically married in her tenth year. When eleven years old she learned to read the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, but could not write. When twelve her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> wished to give her in marriage, but she went to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where she led a life of severe <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">penance</a>, spent much time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and often fell into convulsions. In her fifteenth year she received the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a> on her hands and feet and the marks of the Crown of Thorns on the head. She suffered many assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, had many trials of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and was tempted to <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines</a> thought her crazy and treated her with contempt, so she went back home. As early as 1267 the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Johannes, took Christine into his house, where she made the acquaintance of Peter of Dacia, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> from Gotland who was at Cologne as a pupil of <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">St. Albert the Great</a>. A mystical bond of devotion, the object of which was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was formed between the two. Peter visited Christine in 1270 on his way back from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to Gotland, and again in 1279; in his account of her he mentions altogether fifteen visits. Christine's brother followed Peter to Gotland and entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>. Peter became <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> and in 1283 was prior in Gotland, where he died in 1288. In the same year the torments which Christine suffered through the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> ceased, and she lived a peaceful life, wearing always the dress of the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines</a>, until her death. Her body was first buried in the churchyard at Stommeln and then in the church itself; in 1342 her remains were carried to Niedeggen in the Eifel; a couple of centuries later, 22 June, 1569, they were transferred to J&uuml;lich, where a monument to her still exists. At J&uuml;lich are also to be seen the notes made by Peter of Dacia and the collection of her letters which the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> have published under the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 22 June (IV, 271-430). It is difficult to decide just how much literal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> exists in Christine's visions and apparitions from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>. But even Renan did not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the purity of her life (Hist. litt. de la <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, XXVII, 1-26). The veneration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has not been granted to Christine; however, the <a href="../cathen/10709a.htm">anniversary of her death</a>, 6 November, is observed in J&uuml;lich.
