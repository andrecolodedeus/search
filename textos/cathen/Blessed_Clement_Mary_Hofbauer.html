<h1>Blessed Clement Mary Hofbauer</h1>  

<p>(JOHN DVOR&Aacute;K)

<p>The second founder of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> Congregation, called "the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>", born at Tasswitz in <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, 26 December, 1751; died at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> 15 March, 1821. The family name of Dvorak was better known by its German equivalent, Hofbauer. The youngest of twelve children, and son of a grazier and butcher, he was six years old when his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> died. His great desire was to become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> being unable to give him the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> he became a baker's assistant, devoting all his spare time to study. He was a servant in the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bruck from 1771 to 1775, and then lived for some time as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> abolished hermitages he went to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he worked once more as a baker. After two <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he again tried a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit's</a> life (1782-3), this time under the protection of Barnaba Chiaramonti, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a>, taking the name of Clement, by which he was ever afterwards known. He once more returned to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where at length by the generosity of benefactors he was enabled to go to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and complete his studies; In 1784 he made a third <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> on foot to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with a friend, Thadd&auml;us H&uuml;bl, and the two were received into the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at San Giuliano on the Esquiline. After a shortened probation they were professed on 19 March, 1785, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> a few days later. They were sent, towards the end of the same year, to found a house north of the Alps, <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a>, who was still alive, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesying</a> their success. It being impossible under <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> to found a house in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Clement and Thadd&auml;us turned to <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, where King Stanislaus Poniatowski, at the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio's</a> request, placed St. Benno's, the German national church, at their disposal. Here, in 1795, they saw the end of Polish independence. The labours of Clement and his companions in Warsaw from 1786 to 1808 are wellnigh incredible. In addition to St. Benno's, another large church was reserved for them, where sermons were preached in French, and there were daily classes of instruction for <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Besides this Clement founded an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys. His chief helper, Thadd&auml;us H&uuml;bl, died in 1807; In the next year, on orders from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the house at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a> and three other houses which Clement had founded were suppressed, anti the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> were expelled from the Grand Duchy. Clement with one companion went to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where for the last twelve years of his life he acted as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and director at an <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. During these years he exercised a veritable apostolate among all classes in the capital from the Emperor Francis downward. Unable to found a regular house of his congregation, which was however established, as he had predicted, almost immediately after his death, he devoted himself in a special way to the conversion and training of young men. "I know but three men of superhuman energy", his friend Werner had said, "Napoleon, Goethe, and Clement Hofbauer." "Religion in Austria", said <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, "has lost its chief support." Indeed it was to Clement Hofbauer perhaps more than to any single individual that the extinction of Josephinism was due. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 29 January, 1888; (See <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN MONARCHY</a>, II, 129.)
