<h1>Blessed Colomba of Rieti</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a> in Umbria, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 1467; died at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, 1501. Blessed Colomba of Rieti is always called after her birthplace, though she actually spent the greater part of her life away from it. Her celebrity is based &#151; as it was even in her lifetime &#151; mainly on two things: the highly <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> nature of her career from its very beginning, and her intense devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. She was one amongst a number of saintly <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who seem to have been expressly raised up by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in protest against, and as a sharp contrast to, the irreligion and immorality prevalent in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. These <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, nearly all of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>, had an intense devotion to <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>, and made it their aim to imitate her as nearly as possible. Many seculars, men as well as <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, shared this devotion, amongst these being Ercole I, Duke of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, who had a deep admiration for Colomba and for some other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> religious, her contemporaries, the most notable of whom were Blessed Osanna of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> and Blessed Lucy of <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Narni</a>. For the latter Ercole's veneration was so great that he never rested until he had got her to come with some of her <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> to live in <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, where he built her a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and where she died after many troubles. She began when quite a girl to practise austere penances and to subsist almost entirely on the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> food of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, and continued this for the greater part of her life. At nineteen she joined the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Tertiaries, of whom there were many in town, though still living at home; and she soon won the veneration of her fellow townspeople by her personal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> as well as by some <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that she worked. But Colomba was not destined to remain in <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>. In 1488 she left home and went to <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, where the inhabitants received her as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> built her the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Catherine, in which she assembled all the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> Dominicanesses, who desired her as superior in spite of her youth. In 1494, when a terrible plague was raging in <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, she offered herself as victim for the city. The plague was stayed, but Colomba herself was struck down by the scourge. She recovered only to save her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> severely tried by widely spread <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, which reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whence a commission was sent to examine into her life. She was treated for some time as an imposter, and <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> from her office of <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a>; but finally her innocence triumphed. In 1495 <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, having heard of Colomba's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> from his son the Cardinal Caesar Borgia, who had been living in <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, went himself to the city and saw her. She is said to have gone into <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> at his feet, and also to have boldly told him of all personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was fully satisfied of her great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and set the seal of approval on her mode of life. In the year of 1499 she was consulted, by authorities who were examining into the manner, concerning the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a> of Blessed Lucy of <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Narni</a>, and spoke warmly in favour of their being genuine, and of her admiration for Blessed Lucy's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are still <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, and her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept by her order on 20 May.
