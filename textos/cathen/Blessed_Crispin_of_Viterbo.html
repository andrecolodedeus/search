<h1>Blessed Crispin of Viterbo</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Friar Minor Capuchin</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> in 1668; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 19 May, 1750. When he was five years old, his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother took him to a sanctuary of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, a short distance from <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, where she <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> and placed him under her special protection. The child grew beyond his years in virtue and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; so that the townsfold of <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> were wont to call him <em>il Santarello</em>, the little saint. As Crispin one day saw the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> walking in procession, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inspired him with the desire to embrace the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. He was shortly afterwards received into the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> as a simple <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>. Having been employed for some time as cook in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, he was sent to Tolfa, a town not far distant from Civita Becchia, to fulfil the same office. Thence he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and finally to <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>. Here Crispin was visited by the men of the world, by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and even by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself, who always took delight in conversing with the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>. It was Crispin's constant endeavour to imitate the virtues of his patron, <a href="../cathen/06033a.htm">St. Felix of Cantalice</a>, whom he had chosen as his model of perfection at the beginning of his <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Like St. Felix, he used to call himself the ass or beat of burden of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and, having on one occasion been asked by a stranger why he went bare-headed, Crispin answered jocosely, that "an ass does not wear a hat." Enfeebled by old age and by his numerous austerities, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by his superiors, there to end his holy life. His body, which even at the present time is still in a remarkable state of preservation, rests under one of the side altars in the church of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Fathers</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Blessed Crispin was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a> in 1806. His feat is celebrated only by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>.
