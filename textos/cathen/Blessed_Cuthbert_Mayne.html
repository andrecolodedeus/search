<h1>Blessed Cuthbert Mayne</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, b. at Yorkston, near Barnstaple, Devonshire (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> 20 March, 1543-4); d. at Launceston, Cornwall, 29 Nov., 1577. He was the son of William Mayne; his uncle was a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who had him <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Barnstaple Grammar School, and he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister at the age of eighteen or nineteen. He then went to <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, first to <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a> Hall, then to St. John's College, where he took the degree of M.A. in 1570. He there made the acquaintance of <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Blessed Edmund Campion</a>, <a href="../cathen/09727a.htm">Gregory Martin</a>, the controversialist, Humphrey Ely, Henry Shaw, Thomas Bramston, O.S.B., Henry <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, Jonas Meredith, Roland Russell, and William Wiggs. The above list shows how strong a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leaven was still working at Oxford. Late in 1570 a letter from <a href="../cathen/09727a.htm">Gregory Martin</a> to Blessed Cuthbert fell into the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London's</a> hands. He at once sent a pursuivant to arrest Blessed Cuthbert and others mentioned in the letter. Blessed Cuthbert was in the country, and being warned by <a href="../cathen/14689a.htm">Blessed Thomas Ford</a>, he evaded arrest by going to Cornwall, whence he arrived at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> in 1573. Having become reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1575; in Feb., 1575-6 he took the degree of S.T.B. at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai University</a>; and on 24 April, 1576 he left for the English mission in the company of <a href="../cathen/08483a.htm">Blessed John Payne</a>. Blessed Cuthbert took up his abode with the future confessor, <a href="../cathen/15030a.htm">Francis Tregian</a>, of Golden, in St. Probus's <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, Cornwall. This gentleman suffered <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and loss of possessions for this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> done him by our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. At his house our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was arrested 8 June, 1577, by the high sheriff, Grenville, who was knighted for the capture. He was brought to trial in September; meanwhile his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> was of the harshest order. His indictment under <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of 1 and 13 Elizabeth was under five counts: first, that he had obtained from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> a "faculty", containing <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of the queen's subjects; second, that he had published the same at Golden; third, that he had taught the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in Launceston Gaol; fourth, that he had brought into the kingdom an Agnus Dei and had delivered the same to <a href="../cathen/15030a.htm">Mr. Tregian</a>. fifth, that he had said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>.

<p>As to the first and second counts, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> showed that the supposed "faculty" was merely a copy printed at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> of an announcement of the Jubilee of 1575, and that its application having expired with the end of the jubilee, he certainly had not published it either at Golden or elsewhere. As to the third count, he maintained that he had said nothing definite on the subject to the three illiterate witnesses who asserted the contrary. As to the fourth count, he urged that the fact that he was wearing an Agnus Dei at the time of his arrest was no evidence that he had brought it into the kingdom or delivered it to <a href="../cathen/15030a.htm">Mr. Tregian</a>. As to the fifth count, he contended that the finding of a <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and vestments in his room did not prove that he had said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>.

<p>Nevertheless the jury found him guilty of high treason on all counts, and he was sentenced accordingly. His execution was delayed because one of the judges, Jeffries, altered his mind after sentence and sent a report to the Privy Council. They submitted the case to the whole Bench of Judges, which was inclined to Jeffries's view. Nevertheless, for motives of policy, the Council ordered the execution to proceed. On the night of 27 November his cell was seen by the other <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> to be full of a strange bright light. The details of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> must be sought in the works hereinafter cited. It is enough to say that all agree that he was insensible, or almost so, when he was disembowelled. A rough portrait of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> still exists; and portions of his skull are in various places, the largest being in the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Convent, Lanherne, Cornwall.
