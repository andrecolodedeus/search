<h1>Blessed Ferdinand</h1>  

<p>Prince of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, b. in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, 29 September, 1402; d. at Fez, in <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, 5 June, 1443. He was one of five sons, his mother being Philippa, daughter of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> King John I, known in history for his victories over the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and in particular for his conquest of Ceuta, a powerful <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> stronghold, and his establishment of an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> within its walls. In early life Ferdinand suffered much from sickness, but bodily weakness did not hinder his growth in spirit, and even in his boyhood and youth he gave evidence of remarkable qualities of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. With great strength of character and a keen sense of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and order he combined an innocence, gentleness, and charity which excited the wonder of the royal court. He had a special predilection for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and for the ceremonies and devotions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After his fourteenth year he recited daily the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>, rising at midnight for <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>. Always severe with himself, he was abstemious in his diet and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> on Saturdays and on the eves of the feasts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He cared for the spiritual as well as the corporal necessities of his domestics, while his solicitude for the poor and oppressed was unbounded. His generosity towards the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> was impelled by his desire to share in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. He had himself enrolled for the same reason in all the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> congregations of the kingdom.

<p>Upon the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> in 1433, his brother Edward (Duarte) ascended the throne, while he himself received but a small inheritance. It was then that he was induced to accept the grand-mastership of Aviz, in order that he might be better able to help the poor. As he was not a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, his brother, the king, obtained for him the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. The fame of his charity went abroad, and <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugene IV</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, offered him the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat. This he refused, not wishing, as he declared, to burden his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<p>Though living a life of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> in the midst of the court, Ferdinand was not a mere <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a>. He was also a man of action, and in his boyhood his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was stirred by the heroic campaign against Ceuta. His mother, the queen, had nurtured the martial spirit of her sons, and it is even said that on her deathbed she gave them each a sword, charging them to use it in defence of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and their country, and in particular against unbelievers. An opportunity soon presented itself. In 1437 Edward planned an expedition against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and placed his brothers Henry and Ferdinand in command. They set sail 22 Aug., 1437, and four days later arrived at Ceuta. During the voyage Ferdinand became dangerously ill, in consequence of an abcess and fever which he had concealed before the departure, in order not to delay the fleet. Through some mismanagement the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> numbered only 6000 men, instead of 14,000, as ordered by the king. Though advised to wait for reinforcements, the two princes, impatient for the fray, advanced towards Tangiers, to which they lay siege. Ferdinand recovered slowly, but was not able to take part in the first battle.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> fought <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> against great odds, but were finally compelled to make terms with the enemy, agreeing to restore Ceuta in return for a safe passage to their vessels. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> likewise demanded that one of the princes be delivered into their hands as a hostage for the delivery of the city. Ferdinand offered himself for the dangerous post, and with a few faithful followers, including Jo&#227;o Alvarez, his secretary and later his biographer, began a painful captivity which ended only with his death. He was first brought to Arsilla by Sal&#224; ben Sal&#224;, the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> ameer. In spite of sickness and bodily sufferings, he continued all his devotions and showed great charity towards his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> fellow-captives. Henry at first repaired to Ceuta, where he was joined by his brother John. Realizing that it would be difficult to obtain the royal consent to the restoration of the fortress, they proposed to exchange their brother for the son of Sal&#224; ben Sal&#224;, whom Henry held as a hostage. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moor</a> scornfully rejected the proposal, and both returned to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> to devise means of setting the prince free. Though his position was perilous in the extreme, the Portuguese Cortes refused to surrender Ceuta, not only on account of the treachery of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, but because the place had cost them so dearly and might serve as a point of departure for future conquests. It was resolved to ransom him if possible. Sal&#224; ben Sal&#224; refused all offers, his purpose being to recover his former seat of government.

<p>Various attempts were made to free the prince, but all <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> futile and only served to make his lot more unbearable. On 25 May, 1438, he was sent to Fez and handed over to the cruel Lazurac, the king's vizier. He was first condemned to a dark dungeon and, after some months of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, was compelled to work like a slave in the royal gardens and stables. Amid insult and misery Ferdinand never lost patience. Though often urged to seek safety in flight, he refused to abandon his companions and grieved more for their sufferings, of which he considered himself the cause, than for his own. His treatment of his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> was respectful and dignified, but he would not descend to flattery to obtain any alleviation of his sufferings. During the last fifteen months of his life he was confined alone in a dark dungeon with a block of wood for his pillow and the stone floor for a bed. He spent most of his time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and in preparation for death, which his rapidly failing health warned him was near at hand. In May, 1443, he was stricken with the fatal disease to which he finally succumbed. His <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> refused to change his loathsome abode, although they allowed a physician and a few faithful friends to attend him. On the evening of 5 June, after making a general confession and a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he peacefully gave up his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. During the day he had confided to his confessor, who frequently visited him, that the Blessed Virgin with St. John and the <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">Archangel Michael</a> had appeared to him in a vision. Lazurac ordered the body of the prince to be opened and the vital organs removed, and then caused it to be suspended head downwards for four days on the walls of Fez. Nevertheless he was compelled to pay tribute to the constancy, innocence, and spirit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of his royal victim. Of Ferdinand's companions, four shortly afterwards followed him to the grave, one joined the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, and the others regained their liberty after Lazurac's death. One of the latter, Jo&#227;o Alvarez, his secretary and biographer, carried his heart to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in 1451, and in 1473 his body was brought to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and laid to rest in the royal vault at Batalha amid imposing ceremonies.

<p>Prince Ferdinand has ever been held in great veneration by the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> on account of his saintly life and devotion to country. <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miracles</a> are said to have been wrought at his intercession, and in 1470 he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>. Our chief authority for the details of his life is Jo&#227;o Alvarez, already referred to. <a href="../cathen/03156a.htm">Calderon</a> made him a hero of one of his most remarkable dramas, "El Principe Constante y M&aacute;rtir de <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>".
