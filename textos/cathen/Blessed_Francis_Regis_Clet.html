<h1>Blessed Francis Regis Clet</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> missionary in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; b. 1748, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>, 18 Feb., 1820. His father was a merchant of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, his mother's name was Claudine Bourquy. He was the tenth of fifteen children. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was deeply religious, several members of it having <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Francis attended the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> and afterwards entered the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> which was in charge of the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>. His extant letters in French and Latin show a cultivated mind. On 6 Mar., 1769, he entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a> or <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. There he made his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in 1771 and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1773. The same year he went as professor of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> to the diocesan <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a>. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and learning produced excellent fruits. In the sixteenth year of his stay at <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a> he was sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for the election of a superior general of the congregation. He did not return, for the new superior general appointed him director of the internal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, at the motherhouse in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Scarcely a year had elapsed when the sacking of St. Lazare, on the eve of the taking of the Bastille, scattered his flock. Many of the young men returned to the dismantled house the next day and gathered around their director, but the fury of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolution</a> prevented their remaining.

<p>It was at this period that his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> to become missionary was manifested. His superior yielded to his desires, and he was sent to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1791. The first post assigned him was in Kiang-Si, one of the most destitute <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> settlements in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. He had great difficulty in acquiring the language, which he never fully mastered. The next year he was sent to Hou-Kouang where he laboured for 27 years. Death soon deprived him of his two brother-priests and for several years he ministered alone to a vast district. In spite of difficulties, he succeeded in keeping up the fervour of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and bringing many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> to fold. In July, 1812, his church and schoolhouse were destroyed, but he escaped. In 1818 the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> broke out again with renewed fury. After several remarkable escapes from the seaching parties, he was betrayed by a <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, for the 1500 dollars set on his head, and was taken, 16 June, 1819. He had to undergo the greatest cruelty for five weeks, but not a word of complaint escaped him. Being transferred to another <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, he was treated more humanely and found there Father Chen, a <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>, from whom he could receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. On 1 Jan., 1820, however, sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> was passed on him. The execution took place, 18 Feb., 1820. He was tied to a stake erected like a cross, and was strangled to death, the rope having been relaxed twice to give him a three-fold death agony. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, 27 May, 1900, and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is on the 17 February. His <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">remains</a> rest in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the mother house of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. His holy life and death were the inspiration of Blessed John Gabriel Perboyre, also a <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1840.
