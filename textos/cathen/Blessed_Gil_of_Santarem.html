<h1>Blessed Gil of Santarem</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>: b. at Vaozela, diocese of Viseu, about 1185; d. at Santarem, 14 May, 1265. His father, Rodrigo Pelayo Valladaris, was governor of Coimbra and councillor of Sancho I. It was the wish of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> that Gil should enter the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, and the king was very lavish in best caving <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> upon him. When he was still a boy, he already held <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> at <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>, <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, Idanha, and Santarem. Gil, however, held no desire to be an ecclesiastic; his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was to become a famous physician. After devoting some time to the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and medicine at Coimbra he set out for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, with the intention of perfecting himself in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of medicine and obtaining the doctor's degree. If we may give credence to his unknown contemporaneous biographer, he was accosted on his journey by a courteous stranger who promised to teach the art of magic at Toledo. As payment, so the legend runs, the stranger required that Gil should make over his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and sign the compact with his blood. Gil obeyed and after devoting himself seven years to the study of magic under the direction of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, easily obtained the degree of doctor of medicine, and performed many wonderful cures. One night while he was locked up in his <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> a gigantic <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>, armed head to foot, appeared to him and, with his sword drawn, demanded that Gil should change his wicked life. The same spectre appeared a second time, and threatened to kill Gil if he would not reform. Gil now repented of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways, burnt his books of magic and returned to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, where he took the habit of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> in the newly-erected <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, about 1221. Shortly after, his superiors sent him to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> house at Scallabis, the present Santarem. Here he led a life of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and penance, and for seven years his mind was tormented by the thought of the compact which was still in the hands of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. Finally, his biographer narrates, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was compelled to surrender the compact and place it before the altar of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. Gil returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and on his return to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> became famous for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning. He was twice elected <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of his order in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> ratified his cult on 9 March, 1748.
