<h1>Blessed Giovanni Dominici</h1>  

<p>(BANCHINI or BACCHINI was his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> name).

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, statesman and writer, born at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1356; died at Buda, 10 July, 1420. He entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at Santa Maria Novella in 1372 after having been cured, through the intercession of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>, of an impediment of speech for which he had been refused admission to the order two years before. On his return from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, he laboured as professor and preacher for twelve years at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. With the sanction of the master general, Blessed Raymond of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, he established <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of strict observance of his order at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1391) and Fiesole (1406), and founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Nuns of the Strict Observance. He was sent as envoy of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1406 in which <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> was elected; the following year the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whose confessor and counsellor he was, appointed him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12633c.htm">Ragusa</a>, created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1408 and sent him as ambassador to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, to secure the adhesion of Sigismund to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> Dominici read the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> resignation which <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> had adopted, on his advice, as the surest means of ending the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> on 19 July, 1418, but he accomplished little with the followers of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a>, owing to the supineness of King Wenceslaus. He was declared blessed by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> in 1832 and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed 10 June.

<p>Dominici was not only a prolific writer on spiritual subjects but also a graceful poet, as his many vernacular <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, or <em>Laudi</em>, show. His "Regola del governo di cura familiare", written between 1400 and 1405, is a valuable pedagogical work (edited by Salvi, Florence, 1860) which treats, in four books, of the faculties of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the powers and senses of the body, the uses of earthly goods, and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children. This last book has been translated into German by Rosler (<a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder's</a> Bibliothek der katholischen P&auml;dagogik, VII, Freiburg, 1894). His "Lucula Noctis" (R. Coulon, O.P., Latin text of the fifteenth century with an introduction, Paris, 1908) in reply to a letter of <a href="../cathen/13405b.htm">Nicola di Piero Salutati</a>, is the most important treatise of that day on the study of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> authors. Dominici does not flatly condemn classical studies, but strenuously opposes the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganizing</a> <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a> of the day.
