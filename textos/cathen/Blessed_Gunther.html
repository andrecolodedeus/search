<h1>Blessed Gunther</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> in the eleventh century; b. about 955; d. at Hartmanitz, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, 9 Oct., 1045. The son of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he was a cousin of St. Stephen, the King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and is numbered among the ancestors of the princely house of <a href="../cathen/13594a.htm">Schwarzburg</a>. He passed the earlier of his life at court in the midst of worldly pleasures and ambitious intrigues. He was converted in 1005 at the age of fifty by St. Gotthard, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Hersfeld, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, and resolved to embrace the monastic life in order to do penance for his past faults. With the consent of his heirs, he bequeathed all his goods to the Abbey of Hersfeld, reserving the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to richly endow and maintain the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of G&ouml;llingen, the ownership of which he persisted in retaining despite all the efforts of St. Gotthard to prevent him. In 1006, the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in the following year made his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> as <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Niederaltaich before the holy Abbot Gotthard. Soon afterwards, Gunther urgently entreated to be allowed to govern his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of G&ouml;llingen, and St. Gotthard's remonstrances could not turn him aside from his purpose. Shortly after his elevation to the abbacy, the former <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> fell ill, and as he could not agree with his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> were soon in a perilous condition. By his charitable counsels mingled with severe reprimands, St. Gotthard succeeded in dispelling the ambitious delusions of Gunther, who returned once more to his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> condition at Niederaltaich, and led a edifying life.

<p>In 1008, he withdrew to a wild, steep place near Lalling, to live as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>. In 1001 he penetrated farther north in the forest with several companions and settled at Rinchnach, where he built cells and a <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John Baptist. Here he lived for thirty-four years a life of the greatest poverty and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>. The very water was measured out to the brothers, guests alone being free to use at as they wound. Although he had never learned more than the psalter, Gunther received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in reward for his excessive austerities, profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and edified by his teaching all who came to visit him. Wolferus, his biographer, relates that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him intimately, and often heard his admirable sermons on his patron, St <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> &mdash; sermons which drew tears from all who heard them. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> paid many visits to his relative the King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, obtained from him large <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and urged him to build a number of churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> has reproduced the deed of donation made by King Stephen, 6 June, 1009. In 1029 Conrad II richly endowed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rinchnach, and in 1040 Henry III affiliated it with the Abbey of Niederaltaich. Gunther died in the arms of Duke Brzetislaw of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the church of Brzevnow but his remains were destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> in 1420.
