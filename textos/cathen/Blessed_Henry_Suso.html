<h1>Blessed Henry Suso</h1>  

<p>(Also called <em>Amandus</em>, a name adopted in his writings). German mystic, born at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> on 21 March, about 1295; died at Ulm, 25 January, 1366; declared Blessed in 1831 by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, who assigned his feast in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> to 2 March.
<h2>His life</h2>

<p>His father belonged to the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Berg; his mother, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from whom he took his name, to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Sus (or S&uuml;s). When thirteen years of age he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, where he made his preparatory, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies.

<p>From 1324 to 1327 he took a supplementary course in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <em>studium generale</em> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where he sat at the feet of <a href="../cathen/05273c.htm">Johann Eckhart</a>, "the Master", and probably at the side of <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a>, both celebrated mystics. Returning to <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, he was appointed to the office of <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>, from which he seems to have been removed some time between 1329 and 1334. In the latter year he began his apostolic career. About 1343 he was elected <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, probably at Diessenhofen. Five years later he was sent from <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> to Ulm where he remained until his death.

<p>Suso's life as a mystic began in his eighteenth year, when giving up his careless habits of the five preceding years, he made himself "the Servant of the Eternal Wisdom", which he identified with the Divine essence and, in a concrete form, with the personal Eternal Wisdom made man. Henceforth a burning <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the Eternal Wisdom dominated his thoughts and controlled his actions. He had frequent visions and <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a>, practised severe austerities (which he prudently moderated in maturer years), and bore with rare patience corporal afflictions, bitter persecutions and grievous <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>.

<p>He became foremost among the <a href="../cathen/06306a.htm">Friends of God</a> in the work of restoring religious observance in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>. His influence was especially strong in many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, particularly in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Katherinenthal, a famous nursery of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and in that of Toss, where lived the mystic Elsbeth Stagel, who turned some of his Latin into German, collected and preserved most of his extant letters, and drew from him the history of his life which he himself afterwards developed and published.

<p>In the world he was esteemed as a preacher, and was heard in the cities and towns of Swabia, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, Alsace, and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. His apostolate, however, was not with the masses, but rather with <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of all classes who were drawn to him by his singularly attractive <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, and to whom he became a personal director in the spiritual life.

<p>It has often been incorrectly said that he established among the <a href="../cathen/06306a.htm">Friends of God</a> a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> which he called the Brotherhood of the Eternal Wisdom. The so-called Rule of the Brotherhood of the Eternal Wisdom is but a free translation of a chapter of his "Horologium Sapientiae", and did not make its appearance until the fifteenth century.
<h2>His writings</h2>

<p>The first writing from the pen of Suso was the "B&uuml;chlein der Wahrheit", which he issued while a student at Cologne. Its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was unfavourably criticized in some circles &#151; very probably on account of its author's close relations with <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Eckhart</a>, who had just been called upon to explain or to reject certain propositions &#151; but it was found to be entirely <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>.

<p>As in this, so in his other writings Suso, while betraying <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Eckhart's</a> influence, always avoided the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of "the Master". The book was really written in part against the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> teachings of the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghards</a>, and against the libertine teachings of the Brethren of the Free Spirit. Father <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a> considers it the most difficult "little book" among the writings of the German mystics.

<p>Whereas in this book Suso speaks as a contemplative and to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in his next, "Das B&uuml;chlein der ewigen Weisheit", published early in 1328, he is eminently practical and speaks out of the fullness of his heart to "simple men who still have imperfections to be put off". Bihlmeyer accepts <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle's</a> judgment that it is the "most beautiful fruit of German mysticism", and places it next to the "Homilies" of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a> by <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>. In the second half of the fourteenth and in the fifteenth century there was no more widely read meditation book in the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a>.

<p>In 1334 Suso translated this work into Latin, but in doing so added considerably to its contents, and made of it an almost entirely new book, to which he gave the name "Horologium Sapientiae". Even more elevating than the original, finished in language, rich in figure, rhythmic in movement, it became a favourite book in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> at the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, not only in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but also in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>To the same period of Suso's literary activity may belong "Das Minneb&uuml;chlein" but its <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticity</a> is doubtful.

<p>After retiring to Ulm Suso wrote the story of his inner life ("Vita" or "Leben Seuses"), revised the "B&uuml;chlein der Wahrheit", and the "B&uuml;chlein der ewigen Weisheit", all of which, together with eleven of his letters (the "Briefb&uuml;chlein"), and a prologue, he formed into one book known as the "Exemplar Seuses".

<p>Besides the above-mentioned writings we have also five <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> by Suso and a collection of twenty-eight of his letters (Grosses Briefbuch), which may be found in Bihlmeyer's edition.

<p>Suso is called by Wackernagel and others a "Minnesinger in prose and in the spiritual order." The mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man which is his principal theme gives warmth and colour to his style. He used the full and flexible Alamannian idiom with rare skill, and contributed much to the formation of good German prose, especially by giving new shades of meaning to words employed to describe inner sensations. His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> equipment was characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">schoolmen</a> of his age. In his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> there was never the least trace of an unorthodox tendency.

<p>For centuries he exercised an influence upon spiritual writers. Among his readers and admirers were Thomas &agrave; Kempis and Bl. Peter Canisius.
