<h1>Blessed Ippolito Galantini</h1>  

<p>Founder of the Congregation of Christian Doctrine of Florence; b. at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> of obscure parentage, 12 October. 1565; d. 20 March, 1619. While still a child a wonderful cure turned his thoughts towards the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he devoted himself to teaching the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church of Florence. He was only twelve years old when he attracted the attention of the Archbishop Alexander de' Medici (afterwards <a href="../cathen/09166a.htm">Leo XI</a>), who gave him the church of Sta Lucia al <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a> in which to carry on his work. He divided his time between his trade of silk-weaving and the religious instruction of poor children and adults, and at sixteen felt impelled to found a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for this purpose. The opposition aroused by his solicitude for the poor he overcame by the exercise of wonderful patience. Generous benefactors made it possible for him to erect an oratory, which <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> dedicated in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Francis, in 1602, and in which the work begun at Sta Lucia was continued. The foundation was called the Congregation of Christian Doctrine under the invocation of Sts. Francis and Lucy. It was divided into fifteen classes, according to the age and religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the pupils, each class being governed by special rules and assisting in the instruction of the class below. The members of the first class were admitted to the congregation after a good confession.

<p>Ippolito was indefatigable in his work, collecting <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from the wealthy Florentines, which he distributed among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, founding and reorganizing branches of his congregation, which spread to <a href="../cathen/15504b.htm">Volterra</a>, <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, Pistoia, <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, etc. He introduced the practice of nocturnal adoration to draw the people from the theatre and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> amusements. In Florence, the members of his congregation, by reason of their modesty, were called Van Chetoni. Ippolito was the object of violent <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and malice accusing him of sharing the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, of introducing new rules and reforms. One of his spiritual sons accused him before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and Grand Duke Cosimo of excessive severity, but the charge was not sustained, and Ippolito's congregation was declared to be for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> glory and the public good. Shortly before the holy man's death the grand duke founded a perpetual chaplaincy for the order. Ippolito made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Loreto to place his foundation under the protection of the Blessed Virgin. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the congregation were approved by the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars, and confirmed by <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 17 September, 1824. The founder was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by the same pontiff, 13 May, 1825. His <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works, written for the government and direction of his congregation, had been approved by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in 1747, and were published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1831, together with a brief life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> by Canon Antonio Santelli.
