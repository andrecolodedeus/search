<h1>Blessed James Thompson</h1>  

<p>(Also known as James Hudson).

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, born in or near York; having nearly all his life in that city, died there, 28 November, 1582.

<p>He arrived at <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Dr. Allen's</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> 19 September, 1580, and in May of the next year, by virtue of a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, was admitted at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, with one Nicholas Fox, to all Sacred orders within twelve days, although at the time he was so ill that he could hardly stand. He was sent on the mission the following 10 August, and was arrested at York on 11 August, 1582. On being taken before the Council of the North he frankly confessed his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, to the astonishment of his fellow citizens who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he had not been away more than a year. He was then loaded with double irons and was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, first in a private <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, till his money was exhausted, and then in the castle. On 25 November he was brought to the bar and condemned to the penalties of <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">high treason</a>. Three days later he suffered with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and tranquillity at the Knavesmire, protesting that he had never plotted against the queen, and that he died in and for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. While he was hanging, he first raised his hands to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, then beat his breast with his right hand, and finally made a great sign of the cross. In spite of his sentence, he was neither disembowelled nor quartered, but was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> under the gallows.
