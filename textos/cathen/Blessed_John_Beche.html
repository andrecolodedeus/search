<h1>Blessed John Beche</h1>  

<p>(<em>Alias</em> THOMAS MARSHALL).

<p><a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. at Colchester, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, l December, 1539. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at Oxford (probably at Gloucester Hall now <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> College) he took his degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1515, and within the next fifteen years ruled the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/15588b.htm">St. Werburgh</a>, <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, his name appearing as twenty-sixth on the roll of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of that foundation. He was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. John's, Colchester, 10 June, 1530, and, with sixteen of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, took <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII's</a> Oath of Supremacy, 7 July, 1534. The year 1535 brought the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> of the three <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> (4 May), of <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Bl. John Fisher</a> (22 June), and of <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">St. Thomas More</a> (6 July), all five for the Divine right of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> to universal supremacy in spirituals. Beche was so deeply affected by these examples that his unguarded expressions of reverence and veneration for the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, reported by spies, drew down upon him the resentment of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> king. In November, 1538, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. John's further exasperated Henry and his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> by denying the legal right of a royal commission to confiscate his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Within a year of this he was committed to the Tower on a charge of treason, was discharged from custody, and rearrested some time before the 1st of November, 1539. Witnesses were found to testify how the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> had said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would "take vengeance for the putting down of these houses of religion", that <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Fisher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">More</a> "died like good men and it was pity of their deaths", and that the reason for the king's revolt from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity was the king's desire to marry Anne Boleyn. In his own examination the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> yielded to human weakness and tried to explain away his former assertions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In spite of these lapses he eventually received the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Tried at Colchester, by a special commission, in November, 1539, he no longer pleaded against the charge of <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a> to the newly established order of things. He was convicted and executed. An anonymous contemporary partisan of Henry's <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, quoted by Dom <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> Camm in "Engl. Martyrs", I, 400, says of Abbot Beche and others who died at that time for the same offences, "It is not to be as these trusty traitors have so valiantly jeopardized a joint for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome's</a> sake. . .his Holiness will look upon their pains as upon Thomas Becket's, seeing it is for like matter". The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> by which Abbot John Beche received <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> bears date 13 May, 1895.
