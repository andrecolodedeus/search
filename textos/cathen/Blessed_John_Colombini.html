<h1>Blessed John Colombini</h1>  

<p>Founder of the Congregation of Jesuati; b. at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, about 1300; d. on the way to <a href="../cathen/01109a.htm">Acquapendente</a>, 31 July, 1367. There was nothing in his early life to indicate the presence in his character of any unusual seeds of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Belonging to an old patrician <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he devoted himself, like thousands of his class in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, to commerce, swelled his already substantial fortune, and rose to a position of great prominence and influence among his fellow-citizens, who on several occasions elected him <em>gonfalonier</em>. Fortunate in his marriage, of which two children &#151; Peter and Angela &#151; were the fruit, his private life was marred by his <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, and his proneness to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. One day, while still suffering under a sense of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> after one of his passionate outbursts occasioned by a petty domestic disappointment, he chanced to take up a biography of <a href="../cathen/09763a.htm">St. Mary of Egypt</a>, whose later life had been as conspicuous for penance as her earlier had been for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The perusal of this narrative brought a new light into his fife; henceforth <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> gave way to an almost incredible <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and meekness. The great transformation of his life extended to his business affairs, and excited in the purely mercenary-minded a ridicule easy to understand. Heedless, however, of raillery, he did not rest content with selling cheaper than any other merchant, but persisted in paying more for his purchases than the sum demanded. With the consent of his wife he soon abandoned his former patrician associates, visited <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, tended the sick, and made large donations to the poor. Then casting aside the clothes usual to his station, he assumed the garments of the most indigent, and, having fallen ill and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> himself treated with too much delicacy at home, deserted his luxurious house for the ordinary ward of a poor <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. His relations urged him to return, and finally elicited his consent on the condition that thenceforth he would be given only the coarser forms of nourishment. Nursed back to health, he insisted on making his house the refuge of the needy and the suffering, washing their feet with his own hands, dispensing to them bodily and spiritual comfort, leaving nothing undone that the spirit of charity could suggest. Among the wonders recorded to have taken in this abode of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mercy was the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> disappearance of a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, leaving the room permeated with an indescribable fragrance.

<p>It required eight years to render his wife reconciled to the extraordinary philanthropy of her husband. His son having meanwhile died and his daughter taken the veil, Colombini with the approval of his wife, on whom he first settled a life-annuity, divided his fortune into three parts: the first went to endow a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, the second and third to two <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>. Together with his friend Francisco Mini, who had been associated with him in all charitable labours, Colombini lived henceforward a life of apostolic poverty, begged for his daily bread, and esteemed it a favour to be allowed to wait on the sick poor, while in public and in their dwellings he stimulated the people to penance. He was soon joined by three of the Piccolomini and by members of other patrician <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, who likewise distributed all their goods among the poor. Alarmed at these occurrences, many of the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> now raised an outcry, complaining that Colombini was inciting all the most promising young men of the city to "folly", and succeeded in procuring his banishment. Accompanied by twenty-five companions, Colombini left his native city without a protest and visited in succession Arezzo, <a href="../cathen/03793c.htm">Citt&agrave; di Castello</a>, <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and many other <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> cities, making numerous conversions, reconciling sundered friends, and effecting the return of much <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to its rightful owners. An epidemic which broke out at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> shortly after his departure, was generally regarded as a heavenly chastisement for his banishment, and there was a universal clamour for his recall. Regardless alike of derision and insult, he resumed on his return his former charitable occupations, in his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> rejoicing to perform the most menial services at houses where he had once been an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> guest.

<p>On the return of <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1367), Colombini and his followers hastened to meet him, and begged him to sanction the foundation of their Institution. A commission appointed by <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban</a> and presided over by Cardinal William Sudre, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, having attested their freedom from every taint of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the Fraticelli, whose views some evil-intentioned people had accused them of holding, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gave his consent to the foundation of their congregation. The name <em>Jesuati</em> (Jesuites) had already been given them by the populace of <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> because of their constant use of the ejaculation "Praise be to Jesus Christ." From the very beginning they had a special veneration for <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, and, to this fact and to the apostolic life they led, they are indebted for their longer title, <em>Clerici apostolici s. Hieronymi</em> (Apostolic Clerics of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>). <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban</a> appointed as their habit a white soutan, a white four-cornered hood hanging round the neck and falling in folds over the shoulders, and a mantle of a dun colour; the soutan was encircled by a leathern girdle, and sandals were worn on the feet. Their occupations were to be the care of the sick, particularly the plague-stricken, the burial of the dead, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and strict <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> (including daily scourging). Their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were at first based on the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, modified to suit the aims of the congregation, but the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> was later adopted. Colombini died a week after the foundation of his institute, having appointed Mini his successor. After many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> had occurred at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> inserted Colombini's name in the Roman Martyrology, fixing 31 July for the celebration of his feast, which is of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>. Under Mini and his successor, Blessed Jerome Dasciano, the Jesuati spread rapidly over <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. and in 1606 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> allowed. the reception of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> into the congregation. Abuses, however, crept in subsequently, and the congregation was suppressed by <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> in 1668 as of little advantage to the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The Jesuatesses or Sisters of the Visitation of Mary, founded about 1367 at the suggestion of Colombini by his cousin Blessed Catharine Colombini of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> (d. 20 October, 1387), spoke as little as possible, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> very strictly, and chastised their bodies twice daily. The also spread very rapidly, and survived in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> until 1872.
