<h1>Blessed John Forest</h1>  

<p>Born in 1471, presumably at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where his surname was then not unknown; suffered 22 May, 1538. At the age of twenty he received the habit of St. Francis at Greenwich, in the church of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> of the Regular Observance, called for brevity's sake "Observants". Nine years later we find him at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, studying <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. He is commonly styled "Doctor" though, beyond the steps which he took to qualify as bachelor of divinity, no positive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his further progress has been found. Afterwards he became one of Queen Catherine's <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, and was appointed her confessor. In 1525 he appears to have been provincial, which seems certain from the fact that he threatened with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> the brethren who opposed <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey's</a> legatine powers. Already in 1531 the Observants had incurred the king's displeasure by their determined opposition to the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>; and no wonder that Father Forest was soon singled out as an object of wrath In November, 1532, we find the holy man discoursing at Paul's Cross on the decay of the realm and pulling down of churches. At the beginning of February, 1533 an attempt at reconciliation was made between him and Henry: but a couple of months later he left the neighbourood of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where he was no longer safe. He was probably already in Newgate <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> 1534, when <a href="../cathen/11785a.htm">Father Peto</a> his famous sermon before the king at Greenwich. In his confinement Father Forest corresponded with the queen and <a href="../cathen/14659b.htm">Blessed Thomas Abel</a> and wrote a book or treatise against Henry, which began with the text: "Neither doth any man take the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to himself, but he that is called by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as Aaron was.

<p>On 8 April, 1538, the holy friar was taken to Lambeth, where, before Cranmer, he was required to make an act of <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a>. This, however, he firmly refused to do; and it was then decided that the sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> should be carried out. On 22 May following he was taken to Smithfield to be burned. The <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of "Darvell Gatheren" which had been brought from the church of Llanderfel in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, was thrown on the pile of firewood; and thus, according to popular <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, was fulfilled an old prophecy, that this holy image would set a forest on fire. The holy man's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> lasted two hours, at the end of which the executioners threw him, together with the gibbet on which he hung, into the fire. Father Forest, together with fifty-three other <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyrs</a>, was declared Blessed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, on 9 December, 1886, and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept by the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> on 22 May. Some years ago rumour was current that the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> had been taken to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and were preserved at a residence of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> somewhere in the north of that country. In 1904 the writer of this article made inquiries, to which the Provincial of Cantabria replied that the fathers there were not aware of the existence of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">holy relics</a> in any part of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and that they thought the rumour was unfounded. It seems therefore most probable that the mortal remains of Father Forest still lie hidden at Smithfield, near the corner of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, opposite the gate of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>.
