<h1>Blessed John Houghton</h1>  

<p>Protomartyr of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, b. in Essex, 1487; d. at Tyburn, 4 May, 1535. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, graduating LL.B. about 1497, and later LL.D. and D.D.; he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1501 and entered the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Charterhouse in 1505, where he was <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a> in 1516. He filled the office of <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a>, 1523-28; of <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, 1528-31; of <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Beauvale, Nottinghamshire, from June to November, 1531; of <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Charterhouse, 1531-35; and of provincial visitor, 1532-35. He was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Tower for about a month, with the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, <a href="../cathen/07544a.htm">Blessed Humphrey Middlemore</a>, for refusing to swear that the king's marriage with Queen Catharine was invalid, but took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of succession under the condition <em>quatenus licitum esset</em>, with some of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, 29 May, 1534, the others being sworn 6 June. On or about 13 April, 1535, he was committed again to the Tower for refusing the <a href="../cathen/11177a.htm">oath of supremacy</a>. With him were sent Blessed Robert Laurence, who had succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Beauvale, and had previously been <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Duke of Norfolk and then a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Charterhouse; and Blessed Augustine Webster, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Axholme, Lincolnshire, formerly a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Sheen. These <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a>, who were on a visit to the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Charterhouse, had not had the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> tendered to them, but were brought before the Rolls for that purpose on 20 April, and, on refusing it, were sent back to the Tower. There they were joined by Blessed Richard Reynolds, a <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14394b.htm">Syon</a>, born about 1492, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Christ's and <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> colleges, Cambridge, Fellow of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, 1510, B.D. 1513, subsequently D.D. He became a <a href="../cathen/02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> in 1513, and was considered one of the foremost scholars of his day. All four were indicted 28 April, 1535, under 26 Henry VIII, c. 1, for refusing the <a href="../cathen/11177a.htm">oath of supremacy</a>. The jury at first refused to find them guilty, but were intimidated by Cromwell into doing so the next day. All were hanged in their habits without being previously degraded, and all were disembowelled while fully conscious, Houghton being the first to suffer and Reynolds the last.

<p>With them died a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, Blessed John Hale, LL.B., Fellow of King's Hall, Cambridge, and Vicar of Isleworth, Middlesex, since 13 August, 1521. He took this living in exchange for the Rectory of Cranford, Middlesex, which he had held since 11 September, 1505. There is nothing to identify him with the Rector of Chelmsford of 1492. He may possibly be the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of this name who became scholar of Eton in 1485. He was indicted 20 April, 1535, with the perpetual <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of Teddington, Middlesex, named Robert Feron, for offenses against 25 Henry VIII, c. 22. Both pleaded guilty and were condemned; but Feron was pardoned. Hale was the fourth to suffer.
