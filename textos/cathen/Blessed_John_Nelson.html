<h1>Blessed John Nelson</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, b. at Skelton, four miles from York, in 1534; d. at Tyburn, 3 February, 1577-78. He went to Douay in 1573, and two of his four brothers followed his example and became <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Binche, in Hainault, by Mgr Louis de Berlaymont, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, 11 June, 1576. He was sent on the mission on 7 November following, and appears to have laboured in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. His apprehension took place 1 December, 1577, "late in the evening as he was saying the <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturne</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> for the next day following", and he was committed to Newgate as a suspected Papist. His arrest and its issue had been foretold by a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> he had exorcised a week before. The High Commissioners in a few days by cross-examination induced him to say that the queen was a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>. This constituted <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">high treason</a> under the legislation of 1571. He was <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providentially</a> enabled to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in Newgate, 30 January, 1577-8, and two days later he was brought to the bar and condemned. Thenceforward he was confined "in a most filthy underground dungeon", doubtless the Pit of the Tower, preparing by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> for his end. He was cut down alive, and his last words, when the hangman plucked out his heart, are reported to have been: "I forgive the queen and all the authors of my death." The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> and place of his admission to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> are unknown.
