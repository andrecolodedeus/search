<h1>Blessed John of Parma</h1>  

<p>Minister General of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> (1247-1257), b. at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> about 1209; d. at <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a> 19 Mar., 1289. His family name was probably Buralli. Educated by an uncle, <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Lazarus at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, his progress in learning was such that he quickly became a teacher of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> (<em>magister <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>&aelig;</em>). When and where he entered the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a>, the old sources do not say. Aff&ograve; (Vita, p. 18, see below) assigns 1233 as the year, and <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> as the probable place. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Bologna and at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and finally read the "Sentences" at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, after having assisted at the First Council of Lyons, 1245. Through his great learning and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, John gained many admirers, and at the general chapter of the order at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in July, 1247, was elected minister general, which office he held till 2 Feb., 1257. We may judge of the spirit that animated the new general, and of his purposes for the full observance of the rule, from the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> felt (as recorded by Angelus Clarenus) by the survivors of St. Francis's first companions at his election, though Brother Giles's words sound somewhat pessimistic: "Welcome, Father, but you come late" (Archiv. Litt., 11, 263). John set to work immediately. Wishing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> personally the state of the order, he began visiting the different provinces. His first visit was to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, with which he was extremely satisfied, and where he was received by Henry III (Anal. Franc., I, 252). At Sens in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> St. Louis IX <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with his presence the provincial chapter held by John. Having visited the provinces of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and of Provence, he set out in Sept., 1248, for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, whence <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> recalled him to entrust him with an embassy to the East. Before departing, John appears to have held the General Chapter of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> in 1249 (others put it after the embassy, 1251). It was at this chapter that John refused to draw up new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> to avoid overburdening the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> (<a href="../cathen/13400a.htm">Salimbene</a>, "Mon. Germ. Hist. Script.", XXXII, 300). Only some new <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, which in a later chapter (Genoa, 1254) were included in the official ceremonial of the order, beginning: <em>Ad omnes horas canonicas</em> (last published by Golubovich in "Archivum Franc. Hist.", III, Quaracchi, 1910). The object of John's embassy to the East was the reunion of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, whose representatives he met at <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>, and who saluted him as "angel of peace". John's mission bore no immediate fruit, though it may have prepared the way for the union decreed at the Council of Lyons in 1274.

<p>In his generalate occurred also the famous dispute between the Mendicants and the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/13400a.htm">Salimbene</a> (op. cit., XXXII, 299 sqq.), John went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (probably in 1253), and by his mild yet strenuous arguments strove to secure peace. It been in connection with this attack on the Preachers and the Minors that John of Parma and <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a>, Master General of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, published at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1255 a letter recommending peace and harmony between the two orders (text in Wadding, 111, 380). The "Introductorius in Evangelium &AElig;ternum" of Gerard of S. Donnino (1254), John's friend, having been denounced by the professors of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and condemned by a commission at <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a> in 1256 (<a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Arch. f. Litt.", I, 49 sqq.), John himself was in some way compromised--a circumstance which, combined with others, finally brought about the end of his generalate. He convoked a general chapter at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 2 Feb., 1257. If Peregrinus of Bologna [Bulletino critico di cose francescane, I (1905), 46] be right, <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> secretly intimated to John that he should resign, and decline re-election should it be offered him. On the contrary, <a href="../cathen/13400a.htm">Salimbene</a> (1. c., 301 sqq.) insists that John resigned of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may have exerted some pressure on John, who was only too glad to resign, seeing himself unable to promote henceforth the good of the order. Questioned as to the choice of a successor, he proposed <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, who had succeeded him as professor at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. John retired to the Hermitage of Greccio near <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>, memorable for the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> celebrated there by St. Francis. There he lived in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> exile and complete solitude; his cell near a rock is still shown. But another hard trial awaited him. Accused of Joachimism, he was submitted to a canonical process at Citt&aacute; della Pieve (Umbria), presided over by St. Bonaventure and Cardinal John Gaetano Orsini, protector of the order. The mention of this <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> as protector brings us to a chronological difficulty, overlooked by all modern writers, who assign the process against John to 1257; for <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> (1254-61) retained the protectorship (Anal. Franc., 696, 710; Mon. Germ. Hist.: Scr., XXXIII, 663, 681-2); and Cardinal Orsini became protector, at the earliest, at the end of 1261; see Oliger in "Arch. Francisce. Hist.", III, 346.

<p>Angelus Clarenus tells us that the concealed motive of this process was John's attachment to the literal observance of the rule, the accusation of Joachimism, against which he professed his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, being only a pretext. Other sources, however (Anal. Franc., 111, 350, 698), speak of retractation. The same Clarenus relates that John would have been condemned had it not been for the powerful intervention of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV's</a> nephew, Cardinal Ottoboni Fioschi, later <a href="../cathen/01159a.htm">Hadrian V</a> (concerning whose letter to the judges see Arch. f. Litt., II, 286; Orbis Seraphicus, I, 120). John certainly did not profess the dogmatical <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Joachimism, though he may have held some of its apocalyptic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Upon his acquittal he returned to Greccio, and continued his life of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and work. It was there that an angel once served his Mass (<a href="../cathen/13400a.htm">Salimbene</a>, 1.c., 310; Anal. Franc., 111, 289), and that in 1285 he received the visit of Ubertin of <a href="../cathen/03396a.htm">Casale</a>, who has left a touching account of this meeting ("Arbor Vit&aelig;", <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1485, V, 3). Hearing that the Greeks were abandoning the union agreed upon in 1274, John, now 80 years old, desired to use his last energies in the cause of union. He obtained permission of Nicolas IV to go to <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, but only travelled as far as <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a> (<a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Marches of Ancona</a>), where he died in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, 19 March, 1289. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> 1777; his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept 20 March.

<p>With the exception of his letters scarcely any literary work can with surety be attributed to John. He is certainly not the author of the "Introductorius in Evang. &AElig;ternum", nor of the "Visio Fr. Johannis de Parma" (Anal. Franc., 111, 646-49). With more probability can we attribute to John the "Dialogus de vitia ss. Fratrum Minorum", partly edited by L. Lemmens, O.F.M. (Rome, 1902). The "Chronicle of the XXIV Generals" (Anal. Franc., III, 283) ascribes to John the allegoric treatise on poverty: "Sacrum Commercium B. Francisci cum Domina Paupertate" (ed. Milan, 1539), edited by Ed. d'Alen&ccedil;on (Paris and Rome, 1900), who ascribes it (without sufficient reason) to John Parent. Carmichael has translated this edition: "The Lady Poverty, a thirteenth-century allegory" (London, 1901); another English translation is by Rawnsly (London, 1904); a good introduction and abridged version is given by Macdonell, "Sons of Francis", 189-213. Other works are mentioned by Sbaralea, "Suppl. ad Script." (Rome, 1806), 398.
