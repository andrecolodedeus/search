<h1>Blessed Joseph Vaz</h1>  

<p>A Goanese <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Apostle of Ceylon [<a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Sri Lanka</a>], b. at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, 21 April, 1651; d. at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>, 16 Jan., 1711. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the Konkani Brahmin caste. He learned Portuguese in Sancoale, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> village, and Latin in Baulim, his mother's village, studied rhetoric at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> and philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the College of St. Thomas Aquinas, <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1676, and became a favourite preacher and confessor. Hearing of the oppressed state of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Ceylon under the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, Father Vaz desired to go to their rescue, but was for the time being appointed Superior of the Kanara Mission, a post which he occupied for three years. On his return to <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> in 1684 he spent his time preaching in the villages, and joined the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> then recently established in <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, of which congregation he was soon made superior. In 1686 he obtained permission to give up this office and to proceed to Ceylon. On landing at <a href="../cathen/08269a.htm">Jaffna</a> he found a strong <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> propaganda going on in the island, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion proscribed and under <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. He was therefore forced to wear disguise, and to do his work in secret. Afterwards, taking up his residence in a village called Sillale where the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were numerous and resolute, he succeeded in reviving the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. But this aroused afresh the vigilance of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, and he was forced to change his quarters for Putlam, where he worked with great success for a whole year. He then fixed on Kandy, the capital of a native independent state, as his centre of operations. Being on his arrival denounced as a Portuguese spy, he was quickly put into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where, however, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> gained access to him, thus enabling him to continue his good work. In the end he won the favour of the king, regained his liberty, and began to extend his operations to other parts of the island.

<p>About 1699 several <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were sent to help him in his labours. The news of his success having reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Mgr de Tournon, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, was directed to enter into communication with him. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of erecting Ceylon into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with Father Vaz as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but the latter dissuaded him from this. In his later years Father Vaz had much to suffer from declining health, and in 1710 was unable to leave Kandy. The subject of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was first urged upon the consideration of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> about 1737 by Dom Francisco de Vasconcellos, S.J., <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>, who also claimed <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Ceylon. The process was begun in <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, and a number of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were registered. But the non-fulfilment of certain essential formalities led <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> to cancel the proceedings, with an order, however, that they should be re-instituted. In South Kanara, he is generally known as Venerable Father Joseph Vaz. Mgr Zaleski, Delegate Apostolic of the East Indies, wrote of him in 1894, that he has "unfortunately been almost entirely forgotten. In <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and even in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, there are still some who remember his name, and in <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, the theatre of his Apostolic labours, his name is still mentioned by the older generation; but the rising generation hardly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they owe to him. And yet, his is a name that ought to endure for ever".

<p>[<em>Note:</em> In 1995, Joseph Vaz was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by Pope John Paul II in <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a>, <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Sri Lanka</a>.]
