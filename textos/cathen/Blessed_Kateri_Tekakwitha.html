<h1>Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha</h1>  

<p>(Also known as Catherine Tegakwitha/Takwita.)

<p>Known as the "Lily of the Mohawks", and the "Genevieve of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>" an Indian virgin of the Mohawk tribe, born according to some authorities at the Turtle Castle of <a href="../cathen/02111b.htm">Ossernenon</a>, according to others at the village of Gandaouge, in 1656; died at <a href="../cathen/03458a.htm">Caughnawaga</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 17 April, 1680. Her mother was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> who had been captured by the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> and saved from a captive's fate by the father of Tekakwitha, to whom she also bore a son. When Tekakwitha was about four years old, her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and brother died of small-pox, and the child was adopted by her aunts and a uncle who had become chief of the Turtle clan. Although small-pox had marked her face and seriously impaired her eyesight and her manner was reserved and shrinking, her aunts began when she was yet very young to form marriage projects for her, from which, as she grew older, she shrank with great aversion. In 1667 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries <a href="../cathen/06271a.htm">Fremin</a>, <a href="../cathen/03024b.htm">Bruyas</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12080a.htm">Pierron</a>, accompanying the Mohawk deputies who had been to Quebec to conclude peace with the French, spent three days in the lodge of Tekakwitha's uncle. From them she received her first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but although she forthwith eagerly accepted it in her heart she did not at that time ask to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Some time later the Turtle clan moved to the north bank of the Mohawk River, the "castle" being built above what is now the town of Fonda. Here in the midst of scenes of carnage, debauchery, and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> frency Tekakwitha lived a life of remarkable virtue, at heart not only a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> but a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virgin, for she firmly and often, with great risk to herself, resisted all efforts to induce her to marry. When she was eighteen, Father Jacques de Lamberville arrived to take charge of the mission which included the Turtle clan, and from him, at her earnest request, Tekakwitha received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Thenceforth she practised her religion unflinchingly in the face of almost unbearable opposition, till finally her uncle's lodge ceased to be a place of protection to her and she was assisted by some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indians to escape to Caughnawaga on the St. Laurence. Here she lived in the cabin of Anastasia Tegonhatsihonga, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, her extraordinary <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> impressing not only her own people but the French and the missionaries. Her <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a> were extreme, and Chauchtiere says that she had attained the most perfect union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Upon her death devotion to her began immediately to be manifested by her people. Many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> visit her grave in Caughnawaga where a monument to her memory was erected by the Rev. Clarence Walworth in 1884; and Councils of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and Quebec have petitioned for her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>.

<p>[On 22 June 1980, she was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by Pope John Paul II; her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is celebrated on 14 July. &#151; <em>Ed.</em>]
