<h1>Blessed Louis Allemand</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles, whose name has been written in a great variety of ways (Alamanus, Alemanus, Almannus, Alamandus, etc.), was born at Arbent in the <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Diocese of Belley</a> in 1380 or 1381 (Beyssac, p. 310); d. 16 September, 1450. Through the influence of a relative, Fran&ccedil;ois de Conzi&eacute;, who was <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chamberlain, Allemand soon became prominent in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> world. He was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maguelonne in 1418 by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, who entrusted him with important missions, regarding for example the transference from Pavia to <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> of the council which was convoked in 1423. In December, 1423, he was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles and in 1426 <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>. Later on and especially after 1436 he began to play a most important part in the <a href="../cathen/02334b.htm">Council of Basle</a>, where he made himself the head of the party which maintained the supremacy of the council over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> already much ventilated at <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> where Allemand had been present), and which eventually proceeded to the <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposition</a> of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>.

<p>In 1439 Allemand was primarily responsible for the election of <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, and it was Allemand who, sometime later, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a>. During the continuance of the assembly at Basle the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> showed heroic <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in tending the plague-stricken. He was also a diligent promoter of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> passed by the council in favour of the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception of Our Lady</a>. In the years which followed Allemand discharged several diplomatic missions in behalf of <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, while he openly disregarded the decrees of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>, which pronounced him <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">"excommunicated"</a> and deprived him of his dignity as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. After the resignation of <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, brought about by the assembly of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> which met at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1449, Allemand was reinstated in his dignities by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>. His <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> action at Basle seems to have resulted from an earnest desire for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and having made his submission to <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, he is believed to have done penance for his former disloyal and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> conduct. He died shortly after in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. His private life had always been a <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penitential</a> one, and many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were reported to have been worked at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. In 1527 a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> permitted him to be <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as Blessed.
