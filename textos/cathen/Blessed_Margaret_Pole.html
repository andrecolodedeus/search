<h1>Blessed Margaret Pole</h1>  

<p>Countess of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; b. at Castle Farley, near Bath, 14 August, 1473; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at East Smithfield Green [Tower Green &mdash;<em>Ed.</em>], 27 May, 1541. She was the daughter of George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, and Isabel, elder daughter of the Earl of Warwick (the king-maker), and the sister of Edmund of Warwick who, under Henry VII, paid with his life the penalty of being the last male representative of the Yorkist line (28 Nov., 1499). About 1491 Henry VII gave her in marriage to Sir Richard Pole, whose mother was the half-sister of the king's mother, <a href="../cathen/02376a.htm">Margaret Beaufort</a>. At her husband's death in 1505 Margaret was left with five children, of whom the fourth, Reginald, was to become <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and also the indirect cause of his mother's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, on his accession, reversed her brother's <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">attainder</a>, created her Countess of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, and an Act of Restitution was passed by which she came into possession of her ancestral domains: the king considered her the saintliest <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and, after the birth of the Princess Mary, Margaret of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> became her sponsor in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and confirmation and was afterwards appointed governess of the princess and her household. As the years passed there was talk of a marriage between the princess and the countess's son Reginald, who was still a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. But when the matter of the king's <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> began to be talked of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Reginald Pole</a> boldly spoke out his mind in the affair and shortly afterwards withdrew from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The princess was still in the countess's charge when Henry married Anne Boleyn, but when he was opposed in his efforts to have his daughter treated as <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> he removed the countess from her post, although she begged to be allowed to follow and serve Mary at her own charge. She returned to court after the fall of Anne, but in 1530 <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Reginald Pole</a> sent to Henry his treatise "Pro ecclesiastic&aelig; unitatis defensione", in answer to questions propounded to him in the king's behalf by Cromwell, <a href="../cathen/15091a.htm">Tunstall</a>, Starkey, and others. Besides being a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> reply to the questions, the book was a denunciation of the king's courses (see <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">REGINALD POLE</a>). Henry was beside himself with rage, and it soon became evident that, failing the writer of the "Defensio", the royal <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> was to be wreaked on the hostages in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and this despite the fact that the countess and her eldest son had written to Reginald in reproof of his attitude and action.

<p>In November, 1538, two of her sons and others of their kin were arrested on a charge of <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">treason</a>, though Cromwell had previously written that they had "little offended save that he [the Cardinal] is of their kin", they were committed to the Tower, and in January, with the exception of Geoffrey Pole, they were executed. Ten days after the apprehension of her sons the venerable countess was arrested and examined by Fitzwilliam, Earl of Southampton, and Goodrich, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, but these reported to Cromwell that although they had "travailed with her" for many hours she would "nothing utter", and they were forced to conclude that either her sons had not made her a sharer in their "treason", or else she was "the most arrant traitress that ever lived". In Southampton's custody she was committed to Cowdray Park, near Midhurst, and there subjected to all manner of indignity. In May Cromwell introduced against her a <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">Bill of Attainder</a>, the readings of which were hurriedly got over, and at the third reading Cromwell produced a white silk tunic found in one of her coffers, which was <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> on the back with the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">Five Wounds</a>, and for this, which was held to connect her with the Northern Uprising, she was "attainted to die by act of Parliament". The other charges against her, to which she was never permitted to reply, had to do with the escape from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> of her <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and the conveying of messages abroad. After the passage of the Act she was removed to the Tower and there, for nearly two years, she was "tormented by the severity of the weather and insufficient clothing". In April, 1541, there was another insurrection in Yorkshire, and it was then determined to enforce without any further procedure the Act of <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">Attainder</a> passed in 1539. On the morning of 28 May (de Marillac; Gardner, following Chapuys, says 27) she was told she was to die within the hour. She answered that no crime had been imputed to her; nevertheless she walked calmly from her cell to East Smithfield Green [Tower Green &mdash;<em>Ed.</em>], within the precincts of the Tower, where a low wooden block had been prepared, and there, by a clumsy <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, she was beheaded.
