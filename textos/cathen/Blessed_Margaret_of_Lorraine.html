<h1>Blessed Margaret of Lorraine</h1>  

<p>Duchess d'Alencon, religious of the order of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, born in 1463 at the castle of Vaud&eacute;mont (Lorraine); died at Argentan (Brittany) 2 November, 1521. The daughter of Ferri de Vaudimont and of Yolande d'Anjou, little Margaret became an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> at an early age and was brought up at Aix-en-Proven&ccedil;e, by King of Ren&eacute; of Anjou, her grandfather. The latter dying in 1480 she was sent back to Lorraine to her brother, Ren&eacute; II, who gave her in marriage at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1488, to the Duke d'Alen&ccedil;on. Left a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> in 1492 she busied herself in the administration of her duchy and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of her children. When she was relieved of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> imposed upon her by her position she decided to renounce the world and retired to Mortagne, to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who followed the rule of Saint Elizabeth. Later having brought with her to Argentan some of these <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> she founded there another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which she placed, with the authorization of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, under the rule of Saint Clare, modified by the Minor Observants. She herself took the religious habit in this house and made her <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> on 11 October, 1520, but on 2 November, 1521, after having lived for a year in the most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and austere manner, she died a most holy death in her modest cell at the age of sixty-two. Her body, preserved in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, was transferred when that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was suppressed to the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Germain d'Argentan, but in 1793 it was profaned and thrown into the common burying place.

<p>The memory of Margaret of Lorraine is preserved in the "Martyrologium Franciscanum" and in the "Martyrologium gallicanum". After an invitation made by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13681d.htm">S&eacute;ez</a>, Jacques Camus de Pontcarri, Louis XIII begged <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> to order a canonical inquiry into the virtues and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Duchess d'Alen&ccedil;on; unfortunately in the political agitation of the time the realization of this plan was lost sight of. At the initiative of the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13681d.htm">S&eacute;ez</a> an effort is being made to obtain recognition at the Court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of her cultus. The process is well on its way.
