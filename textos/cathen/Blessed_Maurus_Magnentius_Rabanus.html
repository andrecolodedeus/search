<h1>Blessed Maurus Magnentius Rabanus</h1>  

<p>(<em>Also</em> Hrabanus, Reabanus).

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, celebrated <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and pedagogical writer of the ninth century, born at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> about 776 (784?); died at Winkel (Vinicellum) near <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> on 4 February, 856. He took <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> at an early age in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in 801. A year later he went to Tours to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and the liberal arts, under <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>. He endeared himself to his aged master, and received from him the surname of Maurus in memory of the favourite disciple of St. Benedict. After a year of study he was recalled by his <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, became teacher and, later, head-master of the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. His fame as teacher spread over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> became the most celebrated seat of learning in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire. In 814 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Unfortunately, Abbot Ratgar's mania for building temporarily impeded the progress of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, but under Abbot Eigil (818-82) Rabanus was once more able to devote himself entirely to his vocation of teaching and writing (see <a href="../cathen/03349c.htm">CAROLINGIAN SCHOOLS</a>; <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">DIOCESE OF FULDA</a>). In 822 Rabanus was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and during his reign the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> enjoyed its greatest prosperity. He completed the new buildings that had been begun by his predecessor; erected more than thirty churches and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>; enriched the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church with artistic <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, tapestry, <a href="../cathen/02217c.htm">baldachina</a>, <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a>, and other costly ornaments; provided for the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> by preaching and by increasing the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in country towns; procured numerous books for the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and in many other ways advanced the spiritual, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and temporal welfare of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> and its dependencies. In the political disturbances of the times he sided with Louis the Pious against his rebellious sons, and after the emperor's death he supported Lothair, the eldest son. When the latter was conquered by Louis the German, Rabanus fled from home in 840, probably to evade taking the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance. In 841 he returned and resigned his abbacy early in 842, compelled, it is believed, by Louis. He retired to the neighbouring Petersberg, where he devoted himself entirely to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and literary labours. In 845 he was reconciled with the king and in 847 succeeded Otgar as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place on 26 June. He held three <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>. The 31 canons enacted at the first, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a> in October, 847, are chiefly on matters of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> (Acts in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Conc. Coll. Ampl.", XIV, 899-912). At the second synod, held in October, 848, in connection with a diet, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk of Orbais</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> were condemned. The third synod, held in 852 (851?), occupied itself with the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>. Rabanus was distinguished for his charity towards the poor. It is said in the "Annales Fuldenses" that, during the famine of 850, he daily fed more than 300 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> and <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">the Bollandists</a> style him "Blessed", and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and Limburg on 4 February. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were transferred to Halle by Archbishop Albrecht of Brandenburg. Rabanus was probably the most learned man of his age. In Scriptural and patristic <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he had no equal, and was thoroughly conversant with canon law and liturgy. His literary activity extended over the entire field of sacred and profane learning as then understood. Still, he cannot be called a pioneer, either as an educator or a writer, for he followed in the beaten track of his learned predecessors. A complete edition of his numerous writings is still wanting. Most of them have been edited by Colvenerius (Cologne, 1627). This uncritical edition is reprinted with some additions in PL 107-112. His poems were edited by D&uuml;mmler in "Mon. Germ. Poetae lat. aevi Carol.", II, 154-244. He was a skillful versifier, but a mediocre poet. His epistles are printed in "Mon. Germ. Epist.", V, 379 sq. Most of his works are <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a>. His commentaries, which include nearly all the books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, as well as the Gospel of St. Matthew and the Pauline Epistles &#151; a commentary on St. John is probably spurious &#151; are based chiefly on the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> writings of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a>, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a>. His chief pedagogical works are: "De universo", a sort of encyclopedia in 22 books, based on the Etymologies of Isidore; "De computo", a treatise on reckoning; "Excerptio de arte grammatica Prisciani", a treatise on grammar, etc. Other important works are: "De <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> discipline"; sermons, treatises, a <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a>, and a penitential.
