<h1>Blessed Meinwerk</h1>  

<p>Tenth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, d. 1036: Meinwerk (Meginwerk) was born of the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Immedinger and related to the royal house of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>. His father was Imad (Immeth), Count of Teisterbant and Radichen, and his mother's name was Adela (Adala, Athela). In early youth he was dedicated by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He began his secular and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Stephen in Halberstadt and finished them at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, where he had as schoolmate <a href="../cathen/02513a.htm">St. Bernward</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> and probably the later Emperor Henry II. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he became a canon at Halberstadt, then <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at the Court of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>. Henry II, who greatly esteemed him, named him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, for the express purpose of raising the financial condition of the impoverished church. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Goslar, 13 March, 1009, by Archbishop Willigis of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. For twenty-seven years he laboured with restless energy and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and deserves the title of second founder of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. His <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and a large portion of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> had been destroyed by a conflagration in 1000; he rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> on a much grander scale and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it on 15 Sept., 1015. He employed Greek workmen to build the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Bartholomew, which was considered a work of art. In 1031 he founded the Abbey of Abdinghof, for which he obtained thirteen <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from the Abbey of Cluny. Between the years 1033 - 36, he established the collegiate church for canons-regular at Bussdorf. He built an episcopal palace and new walls for the city. He divided his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> into <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, caused the erection of many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, held frequent visitations, insisted on a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> life among his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, observance of rules in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and was much interested, not only in the spiritual welfare of his subjects, but also in their temporal well-being, for which he introduced improved methods in agriculture, etc. According to his biography his own <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was not of a high grade, but he did much for the spread of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; he called in noted teachers of mathematics, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and of other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and put his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> into a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>, which it retained for many years after his death, many prominent men receiving their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in it, among others, Altmann of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, Anno of Cologne, Frederic of Munster, and others. To defray the expenses of his buildings and charitable works, he made use of church festivals, social gatherings, and other occasions to call upon the generosity of kings and princes, of the rich and noble, of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, frequently importuned the emperor himself, relying upon his friendship and often appealing to his own labours for the state; but he also very liberally used his personal means for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Towards his subjects Meinwerk was frequently harsh, but kind at heart, and, if any serious offence had been given, he would conciliate the party by presents. Twice he made a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the first time in 1014, to assist at the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Henry II, then, in 1026, as companion of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>. On this trip he received from Wolfgang, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, the body of St. Felix for Abdinghof. Similarly he obtained for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, entirely or in part, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Sts. Valerian, Minias, Philip, Juvenal, and of the great martyr-bishop Blasius. His body was buried, according to his wish, in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the church of Abdinghof. Abbot Conrad von Allenhause raised the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and 25 April, 1376, placed them in a beautiful monument in the sanctuary. This has been considered equal to a <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is not in the Proprium of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> of 1884, nor does the schema of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for 1909 show any church, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, or altar dedicated to his name. On the secularization of Abdinghof, 1803, the remains were brought to the church of Bussdorf. The "Vita," (Mon. Germ. SS., XI, 104), written anonymously by a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Abdinghof, soon after 1150, is a history, not a legend, though somewhat ornamented by legendary additions. (Giesebrecht, "Deutsche Kaiserzeit", II, 578.)
