<h1>Blessed Nicholas of Fl&uuml;e</h1>  

<p>(D<font size=-2>E</font> R<font size=-2>UPE</font>).

<p>Born 21 March, 1417, on the Fl&uuml;eli, a fertile plateau near Sachseln, Canton Obwalden, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; died 21 March, 1487, as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> in a neighboring ravine, called Ranft. He was the oldest son of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, well-to-do peasants and from his earliest youth was fond of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, practiced <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, and conscientiously performed the labor of a peasant boy. At the age of 21 he entered the army and took part in the battle of Ragaz in 1446. Probably he fought in the battles near the Etzel in 1439, near Baar in the Canton of Zug in 1443, and assisted in the capture of Z&uuml;rich in 1444. He took up arms again in the so-called Thurgau <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Archduke Sigismund of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1460. It was due to his influence that the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Convent St. Katharinental, whither many Austrians had fled after the capture of Diessenhofen, was not destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> confederates. Heeding the advice of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> he married, about the age of twenty-five, a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> girl from Sachseln, named Dorothy Wyssling, who bore him five sons and five daughters. His youngest son, Nicholas, born in 1467, became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Though averse to worldly dignities, he was elected cantonal councillor and judge. The fact that in 1462 he was one of five arbiters appointed to settle a dispute between the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Stans and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05429b.htm">Engelberg</a>, shows the esteem in which he was held. After living about twenty-five years in wedlock he listened to an inspiration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and with the consent of his wife left his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> on 16 October, 1467, to live as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>. At first he intended to go to a foreign country, but when he came into the neighborhood of Basle, a divine inspiration ordered him to take up his abode in the Ranft, a valley along the Melcha, about an hour's walk from Sachseln. Here, known as "Brother Klaus", he abode over twenty years, without taking any bodily food or drink, as was established through a careful investigation, made by the civil as well as the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> of his times. He wore neither shoes nor cap, and even in winter was clad merely in a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit's</a> gown. In 1468 he saved the town of Sarnen from a conflagration by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> also favored him with numerous visions and the gift of prophecy. Distinguished <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from nearly every country of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> came to him for counsel in matters of the utmost importance. At first he lived in a narrow hut, which he himself had built with branches and leaves, and came daily to Mass either at Sachseln or at Kerns. Early in 1469 the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> built a cell and a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> for him, and on 29 April of the same year the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was dedicated by the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, Thomas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>. In 1479 a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> was put in charge of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and thenceforth Nicholas always remained in the Ranft. When in 1480 delegates of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> confederates assembled at Stans to settle their differences, and civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> seemed inevitable, Henry Imgrund, the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Stans, hastened to Nicholas, begging him to prevent the shedding of blood. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> returned to the delegates with the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit's</a> counsels and propositions, and civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was averted. Nicholas was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Pope Clement IX</a> in 1669. Numerous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> visit the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> near the church of Sachseln, where his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 21 March.
