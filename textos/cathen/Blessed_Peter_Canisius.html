<h1>Blessed Peter Canisius</h1>  

<p>(Kannees, Kanys, probably also De Hondt).

<p>Born at Nimwegen in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, 8 May, 1521; died in Fribourg, 21 November, 1597. His father was the wealthy burgomaster, Jacob Canisius; his mother, &AElig;gidia van Houweningen, died shortly after Peter's birth. In 1536 Peter was sent to <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where he studied arts, <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; he spent a part of 1539 at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, and in 1540 received the degree of Master of Arts at Cologne. Nicolaus van Esche was his <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual adviser</a>, and he was on terms of friendship with such staunch <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as Georg of Skodborg (the expelled <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>), <a href="../cathen/07036b.htm">Johann Gropper</a> (canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>), <a href="../cathen/02566b.htm">Eberhard Billick</a> (the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>), Justus Lanspergius, and other <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Although his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> desired him to marry a wealthy young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, on 25 February, 1540 he pledged himself to <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>. In 1543 he visited Peter Faber and, having made the "Spiritual Exercises" under his direction, was admitted into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, on 8 May. With the help of Leonhard Kessel and others, Canisius, labouring under great difficulties, founded at Cologne the first German house of the order; at the same time he preached in the city and vicinity, and debated and taught in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1546 he was admitted to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and soon afterwards was sent by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to obtain assistance from <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, Hermann von Wied, who had attempted to pervert the diocese. In 1547, as the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of Cardinal Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, he participated in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">general ecclesiastical council</a> (which sat first at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> and then at Bologna), and spoke twice in the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. After this he spent several months under the direction of Ignatius in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1548 he taught rhetoric at <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, preaching in Italian and Latin. At this time Duke William IV of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> requested <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> to send him some professors from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>; Canisius was among those selected.

<p>On 7 September, 1549, he made his solemn profession as <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the presence of the founder of the order. On his journey northward he received, at Bologna, the degree of doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. On 13 November, accompanied by Fathers Jaius and Salmeron, he reached Ingolstadt, where he taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, catechized, and preached. In 1550 he was elected <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and in 1552 was sent by Ignatius to the new college in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; there he also taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, preached at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Stephen, and at the court of Ferdinand I, and was confessor at the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. During <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, 1553 he visited many abandoned <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, preaching and administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The king's eldest son (later Maximilian II) had appointed to the office of court preacher, Phauser, a married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who preached the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Canisius warned Ferdinand I, verbally and in writing, and opposed Phauser in public disputations. Maximilian was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to dismiss Phauser and, on this account, the rest of his life he harboured a grudge against Canisius. Ferdinand three times offered him the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, but he refused. In 1557 <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> appointed him administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> for one year, but Canisius succeeded in ridding himself of this burden (cf. N. Paulus in "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r katholische Theologie", XXII, 742-8). In 1555 he was present at the Diet of Augsburg with Ferdinand, and in 1555-56 he preached in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Prague. After long negotiations and preparations he was able to open <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a> and Prague. In the same year Ignatius appointed him first provincial superior of Upper Germany (Swabia, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, Lower and Upper <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>). During the winter of 1556-57 he acted as adviser to the King of the Romans at the Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and delivered many sermons in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. By the appointment of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes and the order of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he took part in the religious discussions at Worms. As champion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> he repeatedly spoke in opposition to <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>. The fact that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> disagreed among themselves and were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave the field was due in a great measure to Canisius. He also preached in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Worms.

<p>During <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> he visited the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> at Zabern, started negotiations for the building of a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> there, preached, explained the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> to the children, and heard their confessions. He also preached in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and strengthened the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Alsace and Freiburg in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Ferdinand, on his way to Frankfort to be proclaimed emperor, met him at Nuremburg and confided his troubles to him. Then Duke Albert V of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> secured his services; at Straubing the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and preachers had fled, after having persuaded the people to turn from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Canisius remained in the town for six weeks, preaching three or four times a day, and by his gentleness he undid much harm. From Straubing he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be present at the First General Congregation of his order, but before its close <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> sent him with the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> Mentuati to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> to the imperial Diet of Pieterkow; at Cracow he addressed the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and members of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In the year 1559 he was summoned by the emperor to be present at the Diet of Augsburg. There, at the urgent request of the chapter, he became preacher at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and held this position until 1566. His <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> show the care with which he wrote his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>. In a series of sermons he treats of the end of man, of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>, the Mass, the prophecies of Jonas; at the same time he rarely omitted to expound the Gospel of the day; he spoke in keeping with the spirit of the age, explained the justification of man, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> liberty, the proper way of interpreting the Scriptures, defended the worship of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. urged obedience to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> authorities, confession, communion, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>; he censured the faults of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, at times perhaps too sharply, as he felt that they were public and that he must avoid demanding reformation from the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> only. Against the influence of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> he recommended the means of defence which had been in use in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during the first centuries&mdash;lively <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> benedictions, and acts of penance. From 1561-62 he preached about two hundred and ten sermons, besides giving retreats and teaching <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, his confessional and the altar at which he said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> were surrounded by crowds, and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> were placed on the altar. The <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of some of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was aroused, and Canisius and his companions were accused of usurping the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> favoured the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, but the majority of the chapter opposed them. Canisius was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to sign an agreement according to which he retained the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> but gave up the right of administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.



<p>In 1559 he opened a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>; in 1562 he appeared at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>. The council was discussing the question whether communion should be administered under both forms to those of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> who asked for it. Lainez, the general of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, opposed it unconditionally. Canisius held that the cup might be administered to the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> and to some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was not very firm. After one month he departed from <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, but he continued to support the work of the Fathers by urging the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to appear at the council, by giving expert opinion regarding the Index and other matters, by reports on the state of public opinion, and on newly-published books. In the spring of 1563 he rendered a specially important service to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the emperor had come to Innsbruck (near <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>), and had summoned thither several scholars, including Canisius, as advisers. Some of these men fomented the displeasure of the emperor with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who presided over the council. For months Canisius strove to reconcile him with the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. He has been blamed <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> for communicating to his general and to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> representatives some of Ferdinand's plans, which otherwise might have ended contrary to the intention of all concerned in the dissolution of the council and in a new national apostasy. The emperor finally granted all the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> demands and the council was able to proceed and to end peacefully. All <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> praised Canisius, but soon after he lost favour with Ferdinand and was denounced as disloyal; at this time he also changed his views regarding the giving of the cup to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> (in which the emperor saw a means of relieving all his difficulties), saying that such a concession would only tend to confuse faithful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and to encourage the disobedience of the recalcitrant.

<p>In 1562 the College of Innsbruck was opened by Canisius, and at that time he acted as confessor to the "Queen" Magdalena (declared Venerable in 1906 by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>; daughter of Ferdinand I, who lived with her four sisters at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>), and as <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual adviser</a> to her sisters. At their request he sent them a confessor from the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and, when Magdalena presided over the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, which she had founded at Hall, he sent her complete directions for attaining <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>. In 1563 he preached at many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Swabia; in 1564 he sent the first missionaries to Lower <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and recommended the provincial synod of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> not to allow the cup to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, as it had authority to do; his advice, however, was not accepted. In this year Canisius opened a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a> and assumed, in the name of the order, the administration of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> which had been founded there by Cardinal Truchsess. In 1565 he took part in the Second General Congregation of the order in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. While in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he visited Philip, son of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> philologist Joachim Camerarius, at that time a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, and instructed and consoled him. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> sent him as his secret <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to deliver the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> also commissioned him to urge their enforcement, to ask the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes to defend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at the coming diet, and to negotiate for the founding of colleges and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. Canisius negotiated more or less successfully with the Electors of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, with the Duke of J&uuml;lich-Cleves-Berg, and with the City and <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">University of Cologne</a>; he also visited Nimwegen, preaching there and at other places; his mission, however, was interrupted by the death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> desired its continuation, but Canisius requested to be relieved; he said that it aroused suspicions of espionage, of arrogance, and of interference in politics (for a detailed account of his mission see "Stimmen aus Maria-Laach", LXXI, 58, 164, 301).

<p>At the Diet of Augsburg (1566), Canisius and other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, by order of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, gave their services to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Commendone</a>; with the help of his friends he succeeded, although with great difficulty, in persuading the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> not to issue his protest against the religious peace, and thus prevented a new fratricidal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> members of the diet accepted the decrees of the council, the designs of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were frustrated, and from that time a new and vigorous life began for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In the same year Canisius went to Wiesensteig, where he visited and brought back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Count of Helfenstein and his entire countship, and where he prepared for death two <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a> who had been abandoned by the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> preachers. In 1567 he preached the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, gave instruction in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church twice a week to the children and domestics of the town, and discussed the foundling of a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Then followed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod of Dillingen (at which Canisius was principal adviser of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>), journeys to <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, and a visit to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, whom he advised, though unsuccessfully, to take a coadjutor. At Dillingen he received the application of Stanislaus Kostka to enter the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> af Jesus, and sent him with hearty recommendations to the general of the order at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At this time he successfully settled a dispute in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty of the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>. In 1567 and 1568 he went several times to Innsbruck, where in the name of the general he consulted with the Archduke Ferdinand II and his sisters about the confessors of the archduchesses and about the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> house at Hall. In 1569 the general decided to accept the college at Hall.

<p>During <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> of 1568 Canisius preached at <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>; from there he went with Cardinal Truchsess to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Upper German province of the order had elected the provincial as its representative at the meeting of the procurators; this election was illegal, but Canisius was admitted. For months he collected in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> material for a great work which he was preparing. In 1569 he returned to Augsburg and preached <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons in the Church of St. Mauritius. Having been a provincial for thirteen years (an unusually long time) he was relieved of the office at his own request, and went to Dillingen, where he wrote, catechized, and heard confessions, his respite, however, was short; in 1570 he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> again to go to Augsburg. A year latter he was compelled to move to Innsbruck and to accept the office of court preacher to Archduke Ferdinand II. In 1575 <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> sent him with <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> messages to the archduke and to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. When he arrived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to make his report, the Third General Congregation of the order was assembled and, by special favour, Canisius was invited to be present. From this time he was preacher in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Innsbruck until the Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (1576), which he attended as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Morone. In the following year he supervised at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a> the printing of an important work, and induced the students of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to found a sodality of the Blessed Virgin. During <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, 1578, he preached at the court of Duke William of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> at Landshut. The <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> Bonhomini desired to have a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>; the order at first refused on account of the lack of men, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> intervened and, at the end of 1580, Canisius laid the foundation stone. In 1581 he founded a sodality of the Blessed Virgin among the citizens and, soon afterwards, sodalities for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and students; in 1582 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were opened, and he preached in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church and in other places until 1589.

<p>The canton had not been left uninfluenced by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> movement. Canisius worked indefatigably with the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> Peter Schnewly, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Johannes Michel, and others, for the revival of religious sentiments amongst the people; since then Fribourg has remained a stronghold of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1584, while on the way to take part in another meeting of the order at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, he preached at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> and made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image of the Blessed Virgin at <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>. According to his own account, it was then that <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of Fribourg, made known to him his desire that Canisius should not leave Fribourg again. Many times the superiors of the order planned to transfer him to another house, but the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, the city council, and the citizens themselves opposed the measure; they would not consent to lose this celebrated and saintly man. The last years of his life he devoted to the instruction of converts, to making spiritual addresses to the brothers of the order, to writing and re-editing books. The city authorities ordered his body to be buried before the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the principal church, the Church of St. Nicolaus, from which they were translated in 1625 to that of St. Michael, the church of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a>.

<p>Canisius held that to defend the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> with the pen was just as important as to convert the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> he strongly urged the appointment at the council, at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court, and in other parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, of able <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> to write in defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He begged <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> to send yearly subsidies to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> printers of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and to permit German scholars to edit Roman <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; he induced the city council of Fribourg to erect a printing establishment, and he secured special privileges for printers. He also kept in touch with the chief <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> printers of his time &mdash; Plantin of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, Cholin of Cologne, and Mayer of Dillingen &mdash; and had foreign works of importance reprinted in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, for example, the works of <a href="../cathen/01469a.htm">Andrada</a>, Fontidonio, and Villalpando in defence of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>.

<p>Canisius advised the generals of the order to create a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of authors; urged scholars like Bartholom&aelig;us Latomus, Friedrich Staphylus, and Hieronymus Torensis to publish their works; assisted <a href="../cathen/11450a.htm">Onofrio Panvinio</a> and the polemic <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Stanislaus Hosius</a>, reading their <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and correcting <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>; and contributed to the work of his friend <a href="../cathen/14343c.htm">Surius</a> on the councils. At his solicitation the "Briefe aus Indien", the first relations of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missioners, were published (Dillingen, 1563-71); "Canisius", wrote the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> preacher, Witz, "by this activity gave an impulse which deserves our undivided recognition, indeed which arouses our admiration" ("Petrus Canisius", <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1897, p. 12).

<p>The latest bibliography of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> devotes thirty-eight quarto pages to a list of the works published by Canisius and their different editions, and it must be added that this list is incomplete. The most important of his works are described below; the asterisk signifies that the work bears the name of Canisius neither on the title page nor in the preface. His chief work is his triple "Catechism". In 1551 King Ferdinand I asked the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a> to write a compendium of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, and Canisius wrote (Vienna, 1555), at first for advanced students, his "Summa doctrin&aelig; christian&aelig; . . . in usum Christian&aelig; pueriti&aelig;", two hundred and eleven questions in five chapters (the first edition appeared without the name of the author, but later all three catechisms bore his name); then a short extract for <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> children, "Summa . . . ad captum rudiorum accommodata" (Ingolstadt, 1556), was published as an appendix to the "Principia Grammatices"; his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> for students of the lower and middle grades, "Parvus Catechismus Catholicorum" (later known as "Institutiones christian&aelig; pietatis" or "Catechismus catholicus"), is an extract from the larger <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, written in the winter of 1557-58. Of the first Latin edition (Cologne, 1558), no copy is known to exist; the German edition appeared at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>, 1560. The "Summa" only received its definite form in the Cologne edition of 1556; it contains two hundred and twenty-two questions, and two thousand quotations from the Scriptures, and about twelve hundred quotations from the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> are inscribed on the margins; later all these quotations were compiled in the original by <a href="../cathen/03086b.htm">Peter Bus&aelig;us, S.J.</a>, and appeared in four quarto volumes under the title "Authoritates Sacr&aelig; Scriptur&aelig; et Sanctorum patrum" etc. (Cologne, 1569-70); in 1557 Johannes Hasius, S.J., published the same work in one large folio volume, entitled "Opus catechisticum", for which Canisius wrote an introduction. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> of Canisius is remarkable for its ecclesiastically correct teachings, its clear, positive sentences, its mild and dignified form. It is today recognized as a masterpiece even by non-Catholics, e.g., the historians Ranke, Menzel, Philippson, and the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> Kawerau, Rouffet, Zerschwitz.

<p><a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> entrusted Canisius with the confutation of the <a href="../cathen/03534b.htm">Centuriators of Magdeburg</a>. Canisius undertook to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the dishonesty of the centuriators by exposing their treatment of the principal <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the Gospel &mdash; <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, the Apostle St. Peter&mdash;and published (Dillingen, 1571) his next most important work, "Commentariorum de Verbi Dei corruptelis liber primus: in quo de Sanctissimi Pr&aelig;cursoris Domini Joannis Baptist&aelig; Historia Evangelica . . . pertractatur". Here the confutation of the principal <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> is <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> and historical rather than scholastical; in 1577 "De Maria Virgine incomparabili, et Dei Genitrice sacrosancta, libri quinque" was published at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. Later he united these two works into one book of two volumes, "Commentariorum de Verbi corruptelis" (Ingolstadt, 1583, and later <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Lyons); the treatise on St. Peter and his primacy was only begun; the work on the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a> contains some quotations from the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> that had not been printed previously, and treats of the worship of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A celebrated <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the present day called this work a classic defence of the whole <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> about the Blessed Virgin (<a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a>, "Dogmatik", III, 478); in 1543 he published (under the name of Petrus Nouiomagus) "Des erleuchten D. Johannis Tauleri, von eym waren Euangelischen leben, G&ouml;ttliche Predig. Leren" etc., in which several writings of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> mystic appear in print for the first time. This was the first book published by a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>. "Divi Cyrilli archiepiscopi Alexandrini Opera" (Latin translation, 2 fol. vols., Cologne, 1546); "D. Leonis Pap&aelig; huius nominis primi . . . Opera" (Cologne, 1546, later reprinted at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and Cologne), Leo is brought forward as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachings and the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> against the innovators; "De consolandis &aelig;grotis" (Vienna, 1554), exhortations (Latin, German, and Italian) and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, with a preface by Canisius; "Lectiones et Precationes Ecclesiastic&aelig;" (Ingolstadt, 1556), a <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayerbook</a> for students, reprinted more than thirty times under the titles of "Epistol&aelig; et Evangelia" etc.; *"Principia grammatices" (Ingolstadt, 1556); Hannibal Codrett's Latin Grammar, adapted for German students by Canisius, reprinted in 1561, 1564 and 1568; *"Ordnung der Letaney von vnser lieben Frawen" [Dillingen (1558)], the first known printing of the Litany of Loreto, the second (Macerata, 1576) was most probably arranged by Canisius; *"Vom abschiedt des Coloquij zu Wormbs" (s. l. a., 1558?).

<p>*"Ain Christlicher Bericht, was die hailige Christliche Kirch . . . sey" (Dillingen, 1559), translation and preface by Canisius (cf. N. Paulus in "Historischpolit. Bl&auml;tter", CXXI, 765); "Epistol&aelig; B. Hieronymi . . . select&aelig;" (Dillingen, 1562), a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> edition arranged and prefaced by, Canisius and later reprinted about forty times; <a href="../cathen/07472a.htm">"Hortulus Anim&aelig;"</a>, a German <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayer-book</a> arranged by Canisius (Dillingen, 1563), reprinted later, probably published also in Latin by him. The "Hortuli" were placed later on the Index <em>nisi corrigantur</em>; *"Von der Gesellschaft Jesu Durch. Joannem Albertum Wimpinensem" (Ingolstadt, 1563), a defence of the order against Chemnitz and Zanger, the greater part of which was written by Canisius; "Institutiones, et Exercitamentas Christian&aelig; Pietatis" (Antwerp, 1566), many times reprinted, in which Canisius combined the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> for the middle grades and the "Lectiones et Precationes ecclesiastic&aelig;" (revised in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>); "Beicht und Communionb&uuml;chlein" [Dillingen, 1567 (?), 1575, 1579, 1582, 1603; Ingolstadt, 1594, etc.]; "Christenliche . . . Predig von den vier Sontagen im Aduent, auch vonn dem heiligen Christag" (Dillingen, 1570).

<p>At the request of Ferdinand II of Tyrol, Canisius supervised the publishing of *"Von dem hoch und weitberh&uuml;mpten Wunderzeichen, so sich . . . auf dem Seefeld . . . zugetragen" (Dillingen, 1580), and wrote a long preface for it; then appeared "Zwey vnd neuntzig Betrachtung vnd Gebett, dess . . . Bruders Clausen von Vnterwalden" (Fribourg, 1586); "Manuale Catholicorum. In usum pie precandi" (Fribourg, 1587); "Zwo . . . Historien . . . Die erste von . . . S. Beato, ersten Prediger in Schweitzerland. Die andere von . . . S. Fridolino, ersten Prediger zu Glaris vnd Seckingen" (Fribourg, 1590): in this, the first of the popular biographies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> especially worshipped in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, Canisius does not give a scholarly essay, but endeavours to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and arouse their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; "Not&aelig; in Evangelicas lectiones, qu&aelig; per totum annum Dominicis diebus . . . recitantur (Fribourg, 1591), a large quarto volume valuable for sermons and meditations for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; "Miserere, das ist: Der 50. Psalm Davids . . . Gebettsweiss . . . aussgelegt" (Munich, 1594, Ingolstadt, 1594); "Warhafte Histori . . . Von Sanct Moritzen . . . vnd seiner Thebaischen Legion . . . Auch insonderheit von Sanct Vrso" (Fribourg, 1594); *"Catholische Kirchenges&auml;ng zum theil vor vnd nach dem Catechismo zum teil sonst durchs Jahr . . . zusingen" (Fribourg, 1596); "Enchiridion Pietatis quo ad precandum Deum instruitur Princeps" (s. l., 1751), dedicated by Canisius in 1592 to the future emperor Ferdinand II (Zeitschrift f&uuml;r katholische Theologie; XIV, 741); "Beati Petri Canisii Exhortationes domestic&aelig;", mostly short sketches, collected and edited by G. Schlosser, S.J. (Roermond, 1876); "Beati Petri Canisii Epistul&aelig; et Acta": 1541-65, edited by O. Braunsberger, S.J. (4 vols., Freiburg im Br., 1896-1905). There still remain unpublished four or five volumes containing eleven hundred and ninety-five letters and <em>regesta</em> written to or by Canisius, and six hundred and twenty-five documents dealing with his labours.

<p>"Peter Canisius", says the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, Kr&uuml;ger, "was a noble <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>; no blemish stains his character" ("Petrus Canisius" in "Geschichte u. Legende", Giessen, 1898, 10). The principal trait of his character was <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Christ and for his work; he devoted his life to defend, propagate, and strengthen the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hence his devotion to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He did not deny the abuses which existed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; he demanded speedy remedies; but the supreme and full power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> over the whole Church, and the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of his teaching as Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Canisius championed as vigorously as the Italian and Spanish brothers of the order. He cannot be called an "Episcopalian" or "Semi-Gallican"; his motto was "whoever adheres to the Chair of St. Peter is my man. With <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> I desire to follow the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in every respect". Pius V wished to make him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Brendel of Mains, <a href="../cathen/03020a.htm">Brus</a> of Prague, <a href="../cathen/11787a.htm">Pflug</a> of Naumburg, Blarer of Basle, Cromer of <a href="../cathen/05522a.htm">Ermland</a>, and Spaur of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, held him in great esteem. St. Francis of Sales sought his advice by letter. He enjoyed the friendship of the most distinguished members of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> &mdash; <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">Borromeo</a>, <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Hosius</a>, Truchsess, <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Commendone</a>, Morone, Sirlet; of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> Delfino, Portia, Bonhomini and others; of many leading exponents of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> learning; and of such prominent men as the Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, Ruard Tapper, the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> Martin Eisengrein, Friedrich Staphylus, <a href="../cathen/14142a.htm">Franz Sonnius</a>, Martin Rithovius, Wilhelm Lindanus, the imperial vice-chancellors Jacob Jonas and Georg Sigismund Seld, the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> chancellor Simon Thaddaeus Eck, and the Fuggers and <a href="../cathen/15582a.htm">Welsers</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. "Canisius's whole life", writes the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Gautier, "is animated by the desire to form a generation of devout <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> capable of serving the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> worthily" ("Etude sur la correspondance de Pierre Canisius", <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, 1905, p. 46). At Ingolstadt he held disputations and homiletic exercises among the young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and endeavoured to raise the religious and scientific standard of the Georgianum. He collected for and sent pupils to the German College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and provided for pupils who had returned home. He also urged <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> to make donations and to found similar institutions in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; soon <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were built at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, Braunsberg, and Dillingen. At Ingolstadt, Innsbruck, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were built under the guidance of Canisius for the nobility and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the former to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, the latter for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the lower grades. The reformed ordinances published at that time for the Universities of Cologne, Ingolstadt, and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> must be credited in the main to his suggestions.

<p>With <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; the day of his admission to the order he called his second birthday. Obedience to his superiors was his first rule. As a superior he cared with <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the necessities of his subordinates. Shortly before his death he declared that he had never regretted becoming a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, and recalled the abuses which the opponents of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had heaped upon his order and his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Johann Wigand wrote a vile pamphlet against his "Catechism"; Flacius Illyricus, Johann Gnypheus, and Paul Scheidlich wrote books against it; <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> declared that he defended <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> wilfully; Chemnitz called him a cynic; the satirist Fischart scoffed at him; Andre&aelig; Dathen, Gallus, Hesshusen, Osiander, Platzius, Roding, <a href="../cathen/15353b.htm">Vergerio</a>, and others wrote vigorous attacks against him; at Prague the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> threw stones into the church where he was saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>; at <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> he was derided by a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> mob. At <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1568, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to preach in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> in order to disprove the rumour that he had become a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. Unembittered by all this, he said, "the more our opponents <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> us, the more we must <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them". He requested <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authors to advocate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with modesty and dignity without scoffing or ridicule. The names of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> were never mentioned in his "Catechism". His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the German people is characteristic; he urged the brothers of the order to practise German diligently, and he liked to hear the German national <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> sung. At his desire St. Ignatius decreed that all the members of the order should offer monthly Masses and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the welfare of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the North. Ever the faithful advocate of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> at the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, he obtained clemency for them in questions of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures, and permission to give extraordinary absolutions and to dispense from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. He also wished the Index to be modified that German confessors might be authorized to permit the reading of some books, but in his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> he warned the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to abstain from reading such books without permission. While he was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>, a resolution was passed forbidding the use of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> textbooks and, at his request, the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> forbade the importation of books opposed to religion and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. At Cologne he requested the town council to forbid the printing or sale of books hostile to the Faith or immoral, and in the Tyrol had Archduke Ferdinand II suppress such books. He also advised Bishop Urban of <a href="../cathen/07088b.htm">Gurk</a>, the court preacher of Ferdinand I, not to read so many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> books, but to study instead the Scriptures and the writings of the Fathers. At Nimwegen he searched the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of his friends, and burned all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> books. In the midst of all these cares Canisius remained essentially a man of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; he was an ardent advocate of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> and its sodalities. He was also one of the precursors of the modern devotion of the Sacred Heart.

<p>During his lifetime his "Catechism" appeared in more than 200 editions in at least twelve languages. It was one of the works which influenced <a href="../cathen/01331c.htm">St. Aloysius Gonzaga</a> to enter the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; it converted, among others, Count Palatine Wolfgang Wilhelm of Neuburg; and as late as the eighteenth century in many places the words "Canisi" and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> were synonymous. It remained the foundation and pattern for the catechisms printed later. His preaching also had great influence; in 1560 the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> testified that by his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> nine hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> had been brought back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in May, 1562, it was reported the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> communicants numbered one thousand more than in former years. Canisius induced some of the prominent Fuggers to return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and converted the leader of the Augsburg <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>. In 1537 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had been banished from <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> by the city council; but after the preaching of Canisius public processions were held, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> gained <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, people crowded to the jubilee <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> were revived, and frequent Communion again became the rule. After the elections of 1562 there were eighteen <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and twenty-seven <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on the city council. He received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> by a special <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> in 1561. Great services were rendered by Canisius to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through the extension of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; the difficulties were great: lack of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, insufficient <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of some of the younger members, poverty, plague, animosity of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, jealousy on the part of fellow-Catholics, the interference of princes and city councils. Notwithstanding all this, Canisius introduced the order into <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, Swabia, the Tyrol, and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and prepared the way in Alsace, the Palatinate, <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Even opponents admit that to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> principally is due the credit of saving a large part of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> from religious innovation. In this work Canisius was the leader. In many respects Canisius was the product of an age which believed in strange <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, put <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a> to death, and had recourse to force against the adherents of another faith; but notwithstanding all this, <a href="../cathen/08284c.htm">Johannes Janssen</a> does not hesitate to declare that Canisius was the most prominent and most influential <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reformer of the sixteenth century (Geschichte des deutschen Volkes, 15th and 16th editions, IV, p. 406). "Canisius more than any other man", writes A. Chroust, "saved for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> of today" (Deutsche Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Geschichtswissenschaft, new series, II, 106). It has often been declared that Canisius in many ways resembles <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, and he is therefore called the second Apostle of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, Paul Drews, says: "It must be admitted that, from the standpoint of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he deserves the title of Apostle of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>" ("Petrus Canisius", Halle, 1892, p. 103).

<p>Soon after his death reports spread of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> help obtained by invoking his name. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was visited by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> decided to urge his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> investigations of his virtues and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were at first conducted by the Bishops of Fribourg, Dillingen, and Freising (1625-90); the apostolic proceedings began in 1734, but were interrupted by political and <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> disorders. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> resumed them about 1833; <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> on 17 April, 1864, approved of four of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> submitted, and on 20 November, 1869, the solemn <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> took place in St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In connection with this, there appeared between 1864-66 more than thirty different biographies. On the occasion of the tercentenary of his death, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> issued to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> his much-discussed "Epistola Encyclica de memoria s&aelig;culari B. Petri Canisii"; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> issued a collective pastoral; in numerous places of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and in some places in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> this tercentenary was celebrated and about fifty pamphlets were published. In order to encourage the veneration of Canisius there is published at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, monthly since 1896, the "Canisius-Stimmen" (in German and French). The infirmary of the College of St. Michael, in which Canisius died, is now a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. Vestments and other objects which he used are kept in different houses of the order. The Canisius College at <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a> possesses precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. In the house of Canisius in the Broersstraat at Nimwegen the room is still shown where he was born. Other memorials are: the Canisius <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in one of the public squares of Fribourg, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Saviour and the Mother of Sorrows, recently built in his memory in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and the new Canisius College at Nimwegen. At the twenty-sixth general meeting of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> held at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, 1879, a Canisius <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young was founded. The general <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, said every <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in the churches originated by Canisius, is still in use in the greater part of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and also in many places in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. Various portraits of Canisius exist: in the Churches of St. Nicolaus and St. Michael in Fribourg; in the vestry of the Augsburg Cathedral; in the Church of St. Michael at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>; in the town hall at Nimwegen; in the town hall at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Stams. The woodcut in Pantaleo, "Prosopographia", III (Basle, 1566), is worthless. Copper-plates were produced by Wierx (1619), Custos (1612), Sadeler (1628), Hainzelmann (1693), etc. In the nineteenth century are: Fracassini's <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in the Vatican; Jeckel's steel engraving; Leo Samberger's <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>; <a href="../cathen/14285a.htm">Steinle's</a> engraving (1886). In most of these pictures Canisius is represented with his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> and other books, or surrounded by children whom he is instructing. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE</a>; <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">COUNTER-REFORMATION</a>; <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">SOCIETY OF JESUS</a>.)
