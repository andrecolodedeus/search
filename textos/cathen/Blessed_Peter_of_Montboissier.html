<h1>Blessed Peter of Montboissier</h1>  

<p>(Better known as PETER THE VENERABLE).

<p>Born in Auvergne, about 1092; died at Cluny, 25 December, 1156. His mother, Blessed Raingarde, offered him to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sauxillanges of the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Congregation of Cluny</a>, where he made his profession at the age of seventeen. He was only twenty years old when he was appointed professor and <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of V&eacute;zelay, and he discharged his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in that house, and later in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Domene, with such success that at the age of thirty he was elected general of the order. The order, which then counted not less than 2000 houses throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, was in need of reform. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> had begun this work when his predecessor, the Abbot Pontius, who had been deposed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, attempted to be reinstated in his office by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Our saint had to face other attacks made on his order by <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> himself, who did not fail however to acknowledge the eminent virtue of Peter and was the first to call him Venerable. Peter resisted the attacks with both firmness and meekness, and took occasion of them to write the rules of the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Congregation of Cluny</a>, one of the most complete and perfect codes of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. He was prominent in resisting the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> caused by the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a>, after the death of Honorius II (1130). With St. Bernard, he was the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the light of the General <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> (1134), and having encouraged <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> to stand firm in the midst of persecutions, he predicted the end of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, which happened in 1138.

<p>During a visit to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1139) he became interested in <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> and had the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a> for the first time translated into Latin. He made several journeys to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> entrusted him with delicate missions, and he accompanied <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> to the Council of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1147), where the doctrines of Gilbert de la Poree were condemned. Kings and emperors came to him for advice and in the midst of his labours he found time to write numerous letters, valuable <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works on the questions of the day, the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, and concerning the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> and the privileges of his order, besides sermons and even verses. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> praise the precision of his teaching. When <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> had been condemned at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, Peter opened his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to him, reconciled him with St. Bernard and with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of seeing him spend the rest of his life under his guidance. He died on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, according to his wish, "after a sublime sermon to his brethren on the mystery of the day". Honoured as a saint both by the people and his order, he was never <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>; <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> confirmed the cult offered to him (1862).
