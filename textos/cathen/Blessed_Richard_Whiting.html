<h1>Blessed Richard Whiting</h1>  

<p>Last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Glastonbury and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, parentage and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown, executed 15 Nov., 1539; was probably <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the claustral <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a>, whence he proceeded to Cambridge, graduating as M.A. in 1483 and D.D. in 1505. If, as is probable, he was already a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> when he went to Cambridge he must have received the habit from John Selwood, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Glastonbury from 1456 to 1493. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in 1500 and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1501, and held for some years the office of chamberlain of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In February, 1525, Richard Bere, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Glastonbury, died, and the community, after deciding to elect his successor <em>per formam compromissi</em>, which places the selection in the hands of some one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of note, agreed to request <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a> to make the choice of an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> for them. After obtaining the king's permission to act and giving a fortnight's inquiry to the circumstances of the case <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> on 3 March, 1525, nominated Richard Whiting to the vacant post. The first ten years of Whiting's rule were prosperous and peaceful, and he appears in the State papers as a careful overseer of his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> alike in spirituals and temporals. Then, in August, 1535, came the first "visitation" of Glastonbury by Dr. Layton, who, however, found all in good order. In spite of this, however, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the town of Glastonbury was suspended and minute "injunctions" were given to him about the management of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; but then and more than once during the next few years he was assured that there was no intention of suppressing the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>.

<p>By January, 1539, Glastonbury was the only <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> left in Somerset, and on 19 September in that year the royal commissioners, Lavton, Pollard and Moyle, arrived there without warning. Whiting happened to be at his manor of Sharpham. Thither the commissioners followed and examined him according to certain articles received from Cromwell, which apparently dealt with the question of the succession to the throne. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, was then taken back to Glastonbury and thence sent up to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to the Tower that Cromwell might examine him for himself, but the precise charge on which he was arrested, and subsequently executed, remains uncertain though his case is usually referred to as one of treason. On 2 October, the commissioners wrote to Cromwell that they had now come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of "divers and sundry treasons committed by the Abbot of <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a>", and enclosed a "book" of evidences thereof with the accusers' names, which however is no longer forthcoming. In Cromwell's <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, "Remembrances", for the same month, are the entries: "Item, Certayn <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to be sent to the Towre for the further examenacyon of the Abbot, of Glaston . . . . Item. The Abbot, of Glaston to (be) tryed at Glaston and also executvd there with his complvcys. . . Item. Councillors to give evidence against the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Glaston, Rich. Pollard, Lewis Forstew (Forstell), Thos. Moyle." Marillac, the French Ambassador, on 25 October wrote: "The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Glastonbury. . . has lately, been put in the Tower, because, in taking the Abbey treasures, valued at 200,000 crowns, they found a written book of arguments in behalf of queen Katherine." If the charge was high treason, which appears most probable, then, as a member of the House of Peers, Whiting should have been <a href="../cathen/02059c.htm">attainted</a> by an Act of Parliament passed for the purpose, but his execution was an accomplished fact, before Parliament even met. In fact it seems clear that his doom was deliberately wrapped in obscurity by Cromwell and Henry, for Marillac, writing to <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> on 30 November, after mentioning the execution of the Abbots of Reading and Glastonbury, adds: "could learn no particulars of what they were charged with, except that it was the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the late lord marquis"; which makes things more perplexing than ever. Whatever the charge, however, Whiting was sent back to Somerset in the care of Pollard and reached Wells on 14 November. Here some sort of trial apparently took place, and next day, Saturday, 15 November, he was taken to Glastonbury with two of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, Dom John Thorne and Dom Roger James, where all three were fastened upon hurdles and dragged by horses to the top of Toe Hill which overlooks the town. Here they were hanged, drawn and quartered, Abbot Whiting's head being fastened over the gate of the now deserted <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and his limbs exposed at Wells, Bath, Ilchester and Bridgewater. Richard Whiting was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 13 May, 1895. His watch and seal are still preserved in the museum at <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a>.
