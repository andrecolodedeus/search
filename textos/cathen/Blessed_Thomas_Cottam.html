<h1>Blessed Thomas Cottam</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, born 1549, in Lancashire; executed at Tyburn, 30 May, 1582. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Laurence Cottam of Dilworth and Anne Brewer, were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Having completed his studies at Brasenose, Oxford (M.A., 14 July, 1572) he became master of a grammer <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">Converted</a> there to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by Thomas Pound he went over to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, Dec., 1577. Desirous of the Indian mission, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was received (8 April, 1579) as a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> at Sant' Andrea. Attacked by fever about October, he was sent to Lyons to recuperate, and went thence to the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, considering himself as accepted for <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, if his health improved by a visit to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In May (probably 28th), 1580, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, and started (5 June) with four companions for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Through the treachery of an English spy by the name of Sledd he was immediately arrested at Dover, but by a ruse of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Dr. Ely</a>, one of his fellow-travellers, reached <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> safely. Ely being imperilled through this friendly <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a>, Cottam <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> surrendered himself and was committed "close <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>" to the Marshalsea, where he perhaps said his first Mass. After being tortured, he was removed, 4 December, 1580 to the Tower, where he endured the rack and the "scavenger's Daughter". He was arraigned with <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Campion</a> and others and (16 November, 1581) condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>. His execution was deferred till 30 May, 1582 (see Munday's 'Breefe Reporte"), when with <a href="../cathen/15630d.htm">William Filby, Luke Kirby and Laurence Richardson</a>, <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> (all <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> 29 December, 1886), he was drawn to Tyburn and executed. His portrait, with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> misdated, is reproduced in <a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley</a>, "Records", VII (1) 174; his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are the Mass <a href="../cathen/04386c.htm">corporal</a> used by him and four other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the Tower (cf. Camm, English Marytrs, II, 563) and perhaps his autograph in the registers of Sant' Andrea.
