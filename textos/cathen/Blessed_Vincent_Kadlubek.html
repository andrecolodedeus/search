<h1>Blessed Vincent Kadlubek</h1>  

<p>(KADLUBO, KADLUBKO).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, chronicler, b. at Karnow, Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Sandomir</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, 1160; d. at Jedrzejow, 8 March, 1223. The son of a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, he made such progress in his studies that in 1189 he could sign his name as Magister Vincentius (Zeissberg, in "Archiv fur osterreichische Geschichte", XLII, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1870, 25), from which some conclude that he was then a canon of Cracow and principal of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Another document of 1212 (Zeissberg, 29) bears his signature as <em>quondam Sandomirensis praepositus</em>. At the death of Bishop Fulk of Cracow 11 Sept., 1207, the chapter voted for Vincent. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> approved the election 28 March, 1208, and Vincent was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Henry Kielicz, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>. <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> was then in a state of political and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> demoralization, and <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> had asked the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, his schoolmate, to bring about a reform in <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. Vincent worked in harmony with his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, and in visitations and sermons sought to obey the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> instructions. He assisted the religious in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and made notable donations to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Sulejow, Koprzywnica, and Jedrzejow. It was also through his influence that in 124 peace was restored between Andrew of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and Leszek of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> who were contending for the possession of Galicia.

<p>In 1218 Vincent sent in his resignation, and, after its acceptance by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> entered the Monastery of Jedrzejow. He was the first <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Pole</a> to receive the habit of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> (Starovolscius, 56). In due time he made his profession and lived in retirement until his death. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> before the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church. In 1682 <a href="../cathen/14061c.htm">John Sobieski</a> petitioned the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>. A similar request was made in 1699 by the General Chapter of the Order of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>. On 18 Feb., 1764, <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> ratified his cult on supplication of Wojciech Ziemicki, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Jedrzejow.
<h2>Works</h2>

<p>"Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae", in four books. The first three are in the form of a dialogue between Archbishop John of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> (1148-65) and Matthew, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a> (1145-65). The first is legendary the second is based on the chronicle of Gallus, the third and fourth contain matters in Vincent's own experience. Some claim that the work was written at the request of King Casimir, others say at the request of King Leszek, while Vincent was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and others, that it was written in the seclusion of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The latest edition of the work is by Bielowski in "Mon. Pol. hist.", II (Lemberg, 1870).
