<h1>Blois</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF BLOIS (BLESENSIS).

<p>Coextensive with the civil department of Loir-et-Cher and a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On 1 July, 1697, <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> canonically erected the Bishopric of Blois, that territory having theretofore been dependent on the <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Diocese of Chartres</a>. Prior to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, the Diocese of Blois was less extensive than at present, almost the entire arrondissement of Romorantin being subject to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, and the Bas-Vend&ocirc;mois to that of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Mans</a>. The Concordat of 1802 gave Loir-et-Cher to the <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Diocese of Orl&eacute;ans</a>, and in 1822 the Diocese of Blois was re-established. Monseigneur de Th&eacute;mines, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Blois in 1776 and died in exile in 1829, was one of the most obstinate enemies of the Concordat. St. Solennius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> under <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, is a patron of Blois; his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were preserved by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>.

<p>Owing to the proximity of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Micy and Marmoutier, Blois counts among its <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> a number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; Lubinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> in the sixth century; Laumerus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Corbion in the <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Diocese of Chartres</a> (d. About 590), whose body was transported to Blois, at the time of the Norman invasions, by fugitive <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who founded in that city the Abbey of St. Laumer; St. Deodatus, the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a>, also called St. Di&eacute; (sixth century), who assured <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> of the victory at Vouill&eacute; (507); the solitaries Victor and Leonardus; and Aigulphus (seventh century), a native of Blois and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of L&eacute;rins, who was assassinated. Peter of Blois, who came from the Abbey of St. Laumer, was conspicuous in the twelfth century for his defence of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas Becket</a> and for encouraging devotion to the Blessed virgin. The Venerable Charles of Blois, killed in 1364 at the Battle of Auray, was the son of Guy, count of Blois. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> had several great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, one at Selles-sur-Cher, begun as early as the sixth century by the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, St. Eusinus, and another at Pontlevoy, now a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a> at Vend&ocirc;me, dedicated in 1040, was also quite celebrated. The <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> Jean Morin and Jer&ocirc;me Viguier, learned <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of the seventeenth century, were natives of Blois.

<p>At the close of year 1905, the Diocese of Blois had a population of 275,538; 28 pastorates, 266 mission churches, and 8 curacies with subventions from the State. According to the latest statistics, the following institutions are to be found in the diocese: 48 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> conducted by sisters; 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> where farming is taught, conducted by the Freres de St. Fran&ccedil;ois R&eacute;gis and the Soeurs du Protectorat de St. Joseph; 7 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> conducted by sisters; 1 house of refuge for young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, conducted by the Religieuses de Notre Dame de la Charit&eacute;; 5 <em>patronages</em> at Blois; 1 <em>patronage</em> at Romorantin; 8 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and hospices conducted by sisters; 5 houses of retreat conducted by sisters; 5 communities of sisters who care for the sick in their homes; and 9 homes for the aged conducted by sisters.

<p>In 1900 the following congregations were represented in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> at Blois and <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> at Authon. Among the local congregations are the Sisters of Our Lady of Providence, with mother-house at Blois, who have charge of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>. The most frequented place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> is Notre Dame de Villethion at Saint Amand. Others are Notre Dame de Nanteuil at Montrichard, Notre Dame des Aydes at Blois, and Notre Dame des Blanches at Pontlevoy, a sanctuary built at the end of the tenth century by Gilduin, opponent of Foulques Nerra.
