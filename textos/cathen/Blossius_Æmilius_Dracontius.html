<h1>Blossius &AElig;milius Dracontius</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poet of the fifth century. Dracontius belonged to a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Carthage and was the pupil of a noted grammarian named Felicianus. He was called <em>clarissimus</em> (most illustrious), won the favour of the proconsul Pacideius, and led a prosperous life by means of inherited riches and the income of his law practice until he incurred the ill will of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandal</a> king, Gunthamund. The cause of this misfortune seems to have been the expression of sentiments of Romano-Byzantine patriotism; for these utterances Dracontius suffered a long <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. Nothing more is known of his history except that he was still alive when Thrasamund ascended the throne in 496.

<p>His works are the "Romulea", three books on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (De laudibus Dei), and a poem entitled "Satisfactio". The latter two were written in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; the first-mentioned is a collection of pieces composed at various times and written in the style of rhetorical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> exercises. Thus, one of these poems represents a rich man and a poor man as enemies; as a reward for the exploits of the rich man his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> is erected in the public square and accorded the right of sanctuary. Later, in recompense for additional services, the rich man asks for the head of the poor one, whereupon the latter flees to the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> for safety and a formal process ensues. In another poem Achilles deliberates as to whether or not he shall sell the body of Hector. When Dracontius deals with themes of his own day, as in the eulogy on his former teacher, and the "Epithalamia" for two couples who were friends, his style is occasionally less conventional. The writings forming the "Romulea" contain but little suggestion of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poet; on the other hand, the "Satisfactio" and the "De laudibus Dei" manifest an ardent and sometimes eloquent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The "Satisfactio", written about 490, was intended to be instrumental in obtaining the royal pardon; the "De laudibus Dei", produced between 486 and 496, is a recital of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> benefits. The first book of the "De laudibus Dei" has for its main contents a description of the creation; the chief theme of the second is the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> and the Redemption, it also contains vehement attacks on <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>; the third compares, by appropriate examples, the hope of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> who denies himself in order to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the cheerless prospect of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> who counts on no future reward. This poem, like the others, is full of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> taken from other sources; the episodes drawn from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, profane history, and mythology are as varied as the textual reminiscences of the Latin poets, both <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>. However, the excellent pupil of Felicianus was not a thorough master of Latin diction and prosody; his writings give frequent evidence in their form of the surrounding barbarism.

<p>The collection named "Romulea" is incomplete. Probably it should also contain two small poems, one on the months and the other on the origin of the rose; perhaps, further, the "Orestis trag&oelig;dia", which is called a tragedy, though in reality it is an epic poem of some thousand verses, wherein the author follows a unique ancient version of the myth; finally, though with less <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, the "&AElig;gritudo Perdic&aelig;" (Perdica's Malady). The subject of this little poem of 290 hexameters is interesting from the point of view of folk-lore. Perdica, a student of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, has neglected the worship of Venus and by way of revenge this goddess inspires him with a guilty <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for his mother, Castalia. Perdica fails into a decline and his physicians are unable to understand his ailment, but Hippocrates, who ascertains that Perdica's heart beats more <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> when Castalia approaches, recognizes the real nature of the malady. There is no remedy for the trouble and Perdica hangs himself (see Rohde, Der grischisch. Roman, p. 54). The works of Dracontius were not known in their real form until 1791 and 1873. His <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poems were very popular in the sixth and seventh centuries. They were revised by Eugenius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toledo (died 657), but these revisions made great changes in the author's statements. What Eugenius failed to understand he altered; moreover, he corrected the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Dracontius. The latter had said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> deliberately created <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> at the same time (Satisfactio, 15); Eugenius made him say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> tolerated <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. It was in this recension that both the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poems were known until 1791. The larger part of the secular poems of Dracontius were first published in 1873.
