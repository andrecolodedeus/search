<h1>Boccaccino</h1>  

<h2>Boccaccio Boccaccino</h2>

<p>An eminent <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, 1460, and d. probably in 1525 rather than in 1518, the date usually given. He studied, it is thought, with followers of <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Mantegna</a>, at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and was a pupil or fellow-student of Domenico Panetti. At <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a> he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in Sant' Agostino a series of frescoes. He had as an assistant <a href="../cathen/14739b.htm">Benvenuto Garofalo</a>, who left him and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The master followed and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a "Coronation of the Virgin" in Santa Maria in Trastevere. This, however, was so ridiculed by the public, which had expected much of one who had had the hardihood to criticize <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michael Angelo</a>, that the disappointed artist returned to <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a> where, among his most appreciated works, is a frieze in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, showing the "Birth of the Virgin" and other subjects from the life of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. <a href="../cathen/08793c.htm">Lanzi</a> who considered Boccaccino as the best modern among the ancients and the best ancient among the moderns, compares his work in these productions with that of <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a>, treating it as inferior in some qualities while superior in others.

<p>The works of Boccaccino possess much charm, and a number of them greatly resemble those of <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a>. This is notably so in the 'Marriage of the Virgin" and "The Madonna with St. Vincent and St. Anthony" in the church of San Vincenzo at <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, which have often been assumed to be the work of the greater <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> er. Among Boccaccino's works in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, in addition to those already spoken of, are: "The Appearance of Angel to Joachim"; "The Meeting of Joachim and Anna"; "The Circumcision"; "Christ Reasoning with the Doctors"; and "Christ with the four Patron Saints of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>". At the Academy in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> is his much admired "Marriage of St. Catherine" and "Virgin and Child in a Landscape", and in the church of San Giuliano, in the same city, is his "Virgin and Child with four Saints". The Louvre possesses a "Holy Family"; the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> National Gallery a "Procession to Calvary", formerly in a <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a> church; and the <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> Pinacoteca a "Death of the Virgin". Light grey eyes outlined with a dark rim are characteristic of the pictures of Boccaccino.
<h2>Camillo Boccaccino</h2>

<p>A short-lived but brilliant <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, 1511; d. 1546. He was the son and pupil of Boccaccio Boccaccino, whom he surpassed, taking care, it is pointed out, to avoid the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> into which his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> self-esteem had led him. He early showed both originality and strength, and his work has been considered to approach that of Correggio, notably his "Four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>" in the niches of the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> of San Sigismondo near <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, which are thoroughly in the correggio style and were <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> when the artist was only twenty-six. Camillo Boccaccino is thought by <a href="../cathen/08793c.htm">Lanzi</a> to be the greatest artist of the Cremonese <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Two of his works at <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a> are "The Raising of Lazarus" and the "Adultress before Christ", surrounded by friezes showing many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.
