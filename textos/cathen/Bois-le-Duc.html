<h1>Bois-le-Duc</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of Bois-le-Duc (<em>Buscoducensis</em>) lies within the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> province of Brabant, and is suffragan to Utrecht. The city of <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a> (s'Hertogenbosch, or Hertzogenbusch &mdash; <em>Sylva Ducis</em>) was founded in 1184, but with the surrounding territory, was included in the Diocese of Liege until 12 March, 1561. At that time, and in order to check the spread of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> raised it to the dignity of a see, and made it suffragan to <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the illustrious <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> <a href="../cathen/14142a.htm">Francis Sonnius</a> (1562-69), afterwards transferred to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. His successors suffered not a little amid the political disorders and the disastrous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the last quarter of the sixteenth century. When after a long siege the city was captured by Prince Frederick Henry (14 Sept., 1629) and held in the name of the States-General, the sixth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Michael Ophorius, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to abandon his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, which he did in a solemn procession, surrounded by his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and bearing with him a famous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> which he placed in safety at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>.

<p>Joseph de Bergaigne (1638-47) was really little more than <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in name. He was unable to assert his right to the office, and lived an exile from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to which he was deeply attached, but which he beheld in the power of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>. By the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648) the entire territory of <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a> was recognized as a permanent conquest of the seventeen united provinces, and made directly subject to their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, i.e. to the States-General. The exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was forbidden by law, and the pertinent decrees were applied with all possible rigour in the hope of extirpating the ancient Faith. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, however, continued secretly their ministry of preaching and their administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, while their flocks met with invincible patience the storm of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The diocese became a simple mission, governed by a vicar-Apostolic, nearly always, however, a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>Bois-le-Duc was administered in this fashion until 1853. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> had tried (1810) to created another diocese under that name, inclusive of the territory known as the Bouches du Rhin, and had even obtained a titular for the new see in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the imperial courtier, Monsignor Van Camp, but the latter was despised by all good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and the arbitrary act of the emperor was doomed to failure. A similar failure awaited the attempt, authorized by the Concordat of 27 August, 1827, to divide all <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> into two large <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a>. The ancient see was finally revived by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> on the occasion of the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, where, since 1848, the revised constitution has assured to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> full political and religious liberty. Together with three other <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> sees, Bois-le-Duc was re-established by the pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 4 March, 1853, and with its former limits; all four sees were made suffragan to Utrecht. The Right Rev. Jan Zw&#255;sen, a native of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and its most illustrious son, hitherto vicar-Apostolic, was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the re-established see, though temporarily he was known as administrator-Apostolic, since he was already <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, with which office he was to unite the government of <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a>.

<p>In 1865 the first provincial synod was held there, the decrees of which form the actual <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> in all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and exhibit Archbishop Zw&#255;sen as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> organizer of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order in that country. In 1868 he was allowed to resign the <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">archiepiscopal See of Utrecht</a>. Thenceforth, until his death in 1877, he devoted himself to the administration of his beloved See of <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a>. He was succeeded by the Right Rev. Adrian Godschalk, who died in 1892, leaving the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to be filled by Bishop William van den Ven. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>, is the finest monument of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Gothic in the possession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. Though it was almost entirely rebuilt after the conflagration of 1419, it had again suffered notable decay in succeeding centuries. A thorough restoration of the edifice, however, was later begun. Bois-le-Duc had a collegiate chapter as early as 1360, which was made a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter in 1561. The above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> has been restored to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and is once more the object of general devotion. There are two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, one at St. Michiels-Gestel for preparatory studies and the other at Haaren for philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> includes 451,670 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 260 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 625 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 143 <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, and 476 free (Catholic) <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.
