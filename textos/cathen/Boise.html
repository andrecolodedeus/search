<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Boise (<em>Xylopolitana</em>)

<p>Created by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 25 August, 1893, embraces the whole <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">State of Idaho</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> an area of 84,290 square miles. In 1842 a mission was started among the Coeur d'Alene Indians (whom <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Father De Smet, S.J.</a>, had recently visited) by Father Nicholas Point, S.J., and Brother Charles Huet, S.J. Father Joset followed next. The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a> was built sixteen miles from Coeur d'Alene Lake by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> Gazzoli and <a href="../cathen/12662a.htm">Ravalli</a>, aided by the red men. In its construction wooden pegs were used instead of nails. In 1863, the pioneer <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, the Rev. Toussaint Mespli&eacute;, a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a>, and the Rev. A. Z. Poulin, a <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a>, were successively sent to the placer miners of Bois&eacute; Basin by <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Archbishop F.N. Blanchet</a>, first administrator of <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a> Territory. Within six months they built the first churches erected for white people in <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a> City, Placerville, Centerville, and Pioneer; and later, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a> City, of which Sisters of the Holy Names, from <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, took charge. Father J. M. Cataldo, S.J., made unsuccessful advances to the Nez Perc&eacute;s in 1867. Recalled by them in 1872, he soon <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> three hundred of these fierce warriors. In 1876, Father Gazzoli drew many to the Faith by his remarkable medical skill. Interrupted by the Nez Perc&eacute;s <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (1877), the work has since been successfully carried on, <a href="../cathen/13682a.htm">Archbishop Seghers' visits</a> in 1879-83 having given it a new impetus. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, 3 March, 1868, established <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a> as a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> and placed it in charge of the Right Rev. Louis Lootens who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03407c.htm">Castabala</a>, at <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, 9 August, 1868. Born in <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 17 March, 1827, he <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to Victoria in 1852, and spent nine years as a missionary in Vancouver Island and six in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> reached <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a> in January, 1869, and took up his abode at Granite Creek. In 1870 the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church was erected in the capital by Fathers Mespl&eacute; and Poulin, on a site donated by John A. O'Farrell, Col. A. St. Clair, commander of Fort Bois&eacute;, being the priests' main helper in this laborious work. It was scarcely dedicated, however, when it was burned down. Bishop Lootens resigned 16 July 1875, and died 13 January, 1898. He was succeeded by the second <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, the Right Rev. Alphonsus Joseph Glorieux, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Apollonia, 19 April, 1885. He found in his territory about 2,500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with ten churches attended by two secular and several <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. When Boise was made an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> he was transferred thither as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 26 August, 1893.

<p>The diocese has fifty-four <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 34 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 7 academies, and 5 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 950 pupils; 2 industrial and reform <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 150 inmates; 3 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 15,000, mostly of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and German racial affiliations, a sprinkling of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, and 4,000 Indians. On 11 November, 1906, the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of a fine <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was laid near the new episcopal residence. Among the pioneer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who did splendid missionary work here were Fathers L. Verhaag, E. Nattini, F. Hartleib, W. Hendrickx, and C. Van der Donckt, the last being the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a> in 1887, and stationed at Pocatello since June, 1888. The academies and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are conducted respectively by the <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>, of St. Joseph of the Visitation, of Charity, of Providence, of St. Benedict, and of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
