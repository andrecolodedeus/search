<h1>Bombay</h1>  

<p>(BOMBAYENSIS)

<p>The Archdiocese of Bombay comprises the Island of Bombay with several outlying churches in the neighbouring Island of Salsette, and a large portion of the Bombay Presidency stretching northwards from the river Nerbudda as far as Quetta, including the districts of Gujerat (Broach, Baroda, Ahmedabad), Kathiawar, Cutch, Sind and a portion of Beluchistan. Most of the archdiocese is thus separated from its centre in Bombay Island by a distance of about 200 miles, the intervening country being assigned to the Diocese of Damaun. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population under the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is reckoned at about 18,000, of which about 8,000 are in Bombay Island; 3,500 in Salsette; 2,000 in Gujerat, Kathiawar and Cutch, and 4,500 in Sind and Beluchistan. The archdiocese is served by 50 fathers, 19 scholastics, and 16 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> of the German province of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and 19 native <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, attending 24 churches and 25 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, besides Sisters of the Orders of Jesus and Mary and the <a href="../cathen/16030b.htm">Daughters of the Cross</a> engaged in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and charitable work.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>In 1534 the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> began to settle in Bombay. They were accompanied by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who gradually covered the island with churches, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and communities of converts. When in 1665 the island was ceded to the English, the work was continued by the same order and by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. In 1720, on political grounds, the Goanese <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were expelled by the Government, and the Vicar of the Great Mogul (formerly the Vicar of the Deccan) was invited to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Although this was done with the approval of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the Goanese <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from time to time tried with the Government to recover their position, and in 1764 established a "double <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>". At first the vicariate extended indefinitely over the north of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>; but in 1784 the northern portion was separated and given over to the Mission of Tibet. The vicariate then gradually began to be called the Vicariate of Bombay. It was under the care of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> fathers from 1720 to 1854. When they resigned their charge the vicariate was divided, the northern, or Bombay portion, being taken over by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, while the southern, or Poona portion was given to the German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. A few years later the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> also resigned, and hence in 1858 the whole of the Bombay-Poona Mission came into the hands of the German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Meantime a distressing conflict over the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> (often referred to in literature as the Goan or Indo-Portuguese <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>) was raging between the Goanese <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the Portuguese "padroado" and the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> under <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, which in spite of certain ineffectual negotiations, continued till 1886. In that year a concordat with <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> was entered into by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which brought the quarrel to a close and at the same time the whole of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> was placed under a fully constituted <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Bombay received territorial <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Bombay Island and over the northern districts already described, with Poona as a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Mangalore and Trichinopoly were added as suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> in 1893, in which year the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> was held (Acta et Decreta, Bombay, 1898). The Island of Salsette and the coast country as far as the Nerbudda were placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Damaun who also received personal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in Bombay Island over all who came from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, or from any other district under the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> regime. This arrangement is popularly known as the "double <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>".

<h2>Institutions</h2>
<h3>In Bombay Island</h3>

<p>The High School of St. Xavier with 1,400 pupils; the College of St. Xavier with about 350 students preparing for Bombay University degrees. The majority of these pupils are non-Christians, whose admission, however, brings prestige, personal respect and esteem to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body, and enables the College to work on a financial basis, making it possible to provide a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Further, St. Mary's High School with 190 boarders and 310 day-scholars, mostly <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> or Eurasians. The teaching staff of these three institutions consists of Jesuit father and scholastics, assisted by lay masters. For girls, High Schools at Clare road, Par el and the Fort, and a native <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Cavel, under the Nuns of Jesus and Mary.

St. Elizabeth's Widows' Home, under the Nuns of Jesus and Mary; The Allbless Leper Home, Trombay, and the Deaf and Dumb Institute under a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>.

There is no <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, the native <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> being trained at the Papal Seminary at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a> in <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>. The finest buildings in the archdiocese are the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Name with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> residence and Convent School, Bombay; The Bombay Cathedral, a large structure in the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> style; St. Patrick's church, Karachi; the collegiate buildings of St. Xavier's and St. Mary's, Bombay, to which latter St. Anne's church is attached. Local publications include "The Examiner" (formerly called the "Bombay <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Examiner") edited by a Jesuit father; established in 1849 it is published weekly at the Examiner Press which is the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>; "The Bombay East Indian", the weekly organ of the Native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Bombay; a local "Supplement" to the English "Messenger"; a "Messenger of the Sacred Heart" in Marathi, besides a number of vernacular books in Marathi, Gujerati, etc., published according to need.
