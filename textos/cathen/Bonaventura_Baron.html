<h1>Bonaventura Baron</h1>  

<p>A distinguished <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and writer of Latin prose and verse, b. at Clonmel, County Tipperary, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1610; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 March, 1696. His mother was a sister of the well-known <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Luke Wadding</a>, and his brother Geoffrey was a trusted ambassador of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Confederates in their negotiations with the continental rulers. He himself joined the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> community of Clonmel, pursued his studies in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and afterwards proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he took up his residence in the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> of St. Isidore founded by his uncle, Father <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a>. Here, on the completion of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course, he was appointed professor, and devoted himself specially to a defence of the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotist</a> system then generally assailed. During his stay in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he published numerous works on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and history, a full list of which is appended below. About the year 1651 he left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, owing, it is said, to some difficulty with the <a href="../cathen/10039a.htm">master of the sacred palace</a>, and went first to a house of his order at Schwaz in the Tyrol, and then to <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, where he was kindly received by Archbishop Guidobald. He was sent as provincial commissary into <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (about 1656), was again in Schwaz (1661), went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, taught for some time at Wurzburg, where he published a volume of his "Opuscula" (1668), taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and finally returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. It is said that representations were made to secure his appointment to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, but that he declined the office. He was appointed historiographer (1676) by Cosmo de' Medici, Grand-duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and was elected a member of the Academy of Florence. While under the patronage of the grand-duke he published the "Trias Tuscia", in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of three remarkable religious of the country, and, in the same year, the "Orbes Medicei". His last work was a history of the Order for Redemption of Captives, from 1198 till 1297. He died 18 March, 1696, and was buried at St. Isidore's in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> with the inscription, written by John De Burgo, a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college, still exists. Two contemporary oil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of him have come down to us, one preserved in St. Isidore's, the other in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> house, Dublin. His principal works are "Panegyrici Sacroprophani" (Rome, 1643; Lyons, 1656); "Obsidio et expugnatio Arcis Duncannon sub Thoma Preston"; "Praelusiones Philosophicae" (Rome, 1651; Lyons, 1661); "Boetius Absolutus" (Rome, 1653); "Scotus defensus et amplificatus" (3 vols., Cologne, 1664); "Cursus Theologicus" (6 vols., 1670); "Opuscula" (4 vols., 1666-71); "Annales Ordinis Sanctae Trinitatis pro redemptione captivorum ab anno 1198 usque ad annum 1297" (Rome, 1864).
