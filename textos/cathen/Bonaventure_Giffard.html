<h1>Bonaventure Giffard</h1>  

<p>Born at Wolverhampton, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 1642; died at Hammersmith, Middlesex, 12 March, 1734; second son of Andrew Giffard, of Chillington, Staffordshire. His father, who married Catherine, daughter of Sir Walter Leveson, was slain in a skirmish near his own home, during the Civil War. Owing to the religious persecutions, Bonaventure was sent, with his younger brother Andrew, to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>. From <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, in October, 1667, he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to pursue his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for the secular mission. Some years later, he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. Having attracted the attention of King James II by his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning, he was appointed preacher to the court. Religion had been in sore straits in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for the previous fifty years. Dr. Smith had been appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the whole country in 1625, but such was the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> that he was forced to withdraw to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1631, where he remained till his death (1655). For nearly thirty years more his place in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> remained unfilled; finally, in 1685, Dr. Leyburn was appointed to succeed him. <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Pope Innocent XI</a> now entered into negotiations with James II; and, as a result, four vicariates were formed, Dr. Giffard being put in charge of the Midlands. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, at Whitehall, by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, on 22 April, 1688. In religious matters James II displayed too little <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and by his high-handed actions gave great offence to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Not only did he compel the authorities of Magdalen College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, to accept Bishop Parker as their president; but, on Parker's death (1688), he had twelve <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> fellows appointed, and made Dr. Giffard president, despite the fact that the college electors had selected a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, John Hough. The king's nominee took up his residence there on 15 June, 1688. A storm of opposition arose, and he was ejected about five months later. The <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution</a> followed, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was seized and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Newgate, where he remained nearly two years. He was released on bail, in 1690, and for more than twenty-four years led a perilous life, being frequently compelled to hide from the pursuivants. When Dr. Leyburn died, in 1703, Bishop Giffard was charged to look after his district, and from 1708 to 1713 he had to govern the Western vicariate as well. In this he was aided by his brother Andrew, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, till the latter died, 14 Sept., 1714. Henry Howard was nominated as coadjutor to Dr. Giffard in 1720; but, as he died before his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, Benjamin Petre was appointed. The old <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> passed away fourteen years later, in 1734, at the age of ninety-two. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> beside his brother Andrew, in the churchyard of St. Pancras. A few of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> have been preserved, and many of his interesting letters were printed in the "Catholic Miscellany", in 1826 and 1827.
