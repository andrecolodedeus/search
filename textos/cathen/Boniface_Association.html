<h1>Boniface Association</h1>  

<p>(B<font size=-2>ONIFATIUSVEREIN</font>).

<p>The Boniface Association, one of the most successful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, owes its origin to a suggestion made by <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> at the Third <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congress of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, held at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1849. The object of the association is to maintain what the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church possesses in those regions where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are few in number, to found and support missions and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and to erect churches, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-houses, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The territories which the association takes under its especial care are: the Diocese of Kulm; the Delegature of Brandenburg and <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, belonging to the Prince-Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>; the Vicariate Apostolic of Saxony; the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>; the Northern Missions, etc. The association is managed by a general committee at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> committees have entire control of the contributions they receive; after consultation with their respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> councils, and under the approval of the general committee, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> committees designate the objects to which the money shall be given. Since the association was founded about $9,250,000 has been collected and some 2,600 churches have been erected or aided.

<p>Besides the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> committees another important branch is formed by the Boniface collecting <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. The first of these was founded in 1885 among the merchants of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> by the Marist congregation; the aim of this branch of the association is, by the founding of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> and institutions where children are prepared for their first <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">communion</a>, to care for the religious training of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children in non-Catholic communities. The funds are obtained by the collection and sale of objects of little value in themselves, such as, tin-foil, old postage stamps, clothing, leaden <a href="../cathen/13649a.htm">seals</a>, old <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, books, cigar bands, cigar tips, and such trifles. More than $625,000 has been raised by this branch association since its foundation; it aids more than 120 institutions for first communicants and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, besides contributing considerable sums to children in non-Catholic communities for railway tickets, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and living expenses.

<p>Another branch is the Academic Boniface Association which has existed for forty years at the German <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, he first one of these <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> being founded at M&uuml;nster in 1867. In 1888 the various <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> branches met at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> and united into a common organization; in 1907 they included thirty-six branches with a membership of 750. Their organ is the "Akademische Bonifatius-Korrespondenz". Since 1860 the general association has had a printing office and since 1888 a bookstore for old and new publications, both at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have granted <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and privileges to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> connected with the association. The association issues the "Bonifatiusblatt", founded in 1850; the "Schlesisches Bonifatiusblatt", 1860; and the "St. Bonifatiusblatt" at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, founded in 1904.
