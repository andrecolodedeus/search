<h1>Boniface of Savoy</h1>  

<p>Forty-sixth <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and son of Thomas, Count of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth uncertain; d. in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, 14 July, 1270. While yet a child he became a <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>. In 1234, as sub-deacon, he was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Belley</a> in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>: and, in 1241, administered the <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Diocese of Valence</a>. His connection with the royal house of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> secured his promotion to the primacy. The Queen of Henry III was Eleanor, daughter of Berengar, Count of Provence, and Beatrice of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. This Beatrice was the sister of the future <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. When St. Edmund died, in 1241, the Queen's uncle was elected. But <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/03479a.htm">Celestine IV</a> dying unexpectedly, it was not until the end of 1243 that the new Pope, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, was able to confirm his election. In the following year Boniface went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for the first time. He found his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. The heavy taxation during the sequestration in St. Edmund's primacy had severely burdened its already slender resources. Therefore his first act was to make every economy, abolishing all sinecures and unnecessary offices connected with the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>. He ordered the tenants and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to contribute towards the liquidation of the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>.

<p>In 1244 he set out for the Council of Lyons, where he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (15 January, 1245) by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. His brother Philip, afterwards Count of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, although not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, held the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and was in command of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> troops. During the sitting of the council Boniface held a commission under him. He obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the grant of the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of all vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in the Province of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> during seven years, and his claim to levy a contribution from the whole province to meet the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> was allowed. In 1249 he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> with great pomp at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> on <a href="../cathen/01315a.htm">All Saints' Day</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> then began a personal visitation of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, correcting abuses and levying fines. But, on extending his visitation to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of his suffragans, resistance was offered to him. In <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> the Dean and Canons of St. Paul's protested that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> was their visitor and appealed. They were promptly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. On the following day the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> visited the Priory of St. Bartholomew. He was met by the sub-prior and brethren, who welcomed him as a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> but not as a visitor. Like the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of St. Paul's they represented that they had their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and would not submit to other <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> without permission from him. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was so incensed that he felled the venerable sub-prior to the earth. This was more than the Londoners could stand from a foreigner, even were he their <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. They fell upon him, his vestments were torn in the struggle, and the coat of mail worn beneath them disclosed. He was rescued by his bodyguard and escaped by barge to Lambeth, where he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of St. Bartholomew's and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>.

<p>He then announced his intention of holding a visitation at <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>. The suffragans met and resolved to resist him. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the province levied a tax upon themselves in order to proceed against him at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Learning of these things he promptly set out for the Roman court. The result was a compromise, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirming the right of visitation, but restricting its use. Godwin says of him that Boniface did three worthy things: he paid off a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of 22,000 marks; he built and endowed the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Maidstone; and he finished the great hall of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> palace.

<p><a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/11777a.htm">suit</a> of Charles Albert of Savoy, King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> (1831-49), approved the cult of Boniface, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, as <em>ab immemorabili</em>.
