<h1>Book of Advertisements</h1>  

<p>A series of enactments concerning <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, drawn up by Matthew Parker, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> (1559-75), with the help of Grindal, Horne, Cox, and Bullingham. It is important as connected with the origin of English Nonconformity, and as being one of a group of documents concerning ritual, the import of which became in the nineteenth century the subject of prolonged and inconclusive discussion. On Elizabeth's accession (November, 1558), the Latin services and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ceremonial were in use. The return from exile of the extreme <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> disputes at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> had shown the lengths to which they were prepared to go, was viewed with apprehension by those in authority. The opposition of the House of Lords to the Act of Uniformity (1559), rendering <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> the use of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">English Prayer-Book</a>, made the Government warily follow a policy of compromise. The <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> authorizing (subject to the proviso in the act, "until other order should be taken by the Queen"), the retention of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ornaments in use in the second year of Edward VI, was in direct opposition to the tone of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer-Book</a>, for the communion service was substantially that of the second <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Prayer-Book</a> of Edward VI (1552), which had been said at a bare table by a supliced minister. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers'</a> dismay was extreme. "Other order", however, was taken by Elizabeth in the "Injunctions", of which the provisions, though opposed to the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a>, became the rule of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> were further appeased by the wholesale destruction of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> vestments and emblems during the General Visitation (August-October, 1559). The Bishops' Conference held in February, 1560, ended in compromise; the crucifix was rejected, but the cope was retained. Such "rags of the Roman <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>" irritated the extreme <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, who wanted a worship purified from all taint of popery, and they were, therefore, known as "<a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a>". They would have none of the cap and gown for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> use in daily life, nor of the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> in church. Elizabeth peremptorily called upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (January, 1564-65) to restore uniformity, and Parker with Grindal and others drew up a "Book of Articles", which he forwarded to Sir William Cecil (3 March, 1564-65). To his intense annoyance they were not approved; but after many delays and alterations they were again submitted to Cecil (28 March, 1566), and published under the title of "Aduertisements, partly for due order in the publique administration of common prayers and usinge the holy sacraments, and partly for the apparell of all persons ecclesiasticall." Elizabeth withheld her formal assent and support; and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were told to exercise their own lawful authority, and so made to bear all the odium their action aroused. The "Advertisements" recognize that it is impossible to get the cope worn at the communion service, and are content to enforce the use of the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>. Hence, then, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> vestment for all services is the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, and the cope for the communion service in <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a>. Even that was too much for the liking of the extremists. Conformity was enforced under penalty of deprivation, thus giving rise to violent dissensions which embittered Parker's closing years, and occasioned the first open separation of <a href="../cathen/11095b.htm">Nonconformists</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>.
