<h1>Book of Judith</h1>  

<h2>History</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, King of Nineveh, sends his general Holofernes to subdue the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The latter besieges them in <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>, a city on the southern verge of the Plain of Esdrelon. Achior, the <a href="../cathen/01431b.htm">Ammonite</a>, who speaks in defense of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, is maltreated by him and sent into the besieged city to await his punishment when Holofernes shall have taken it. Famine undermines the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of the besieged and they contemplate surrender, but Judith, a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, upbraids them and says that she will deliver the city. She goes into the camp of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> and captivates Holofernes by her beauty, and finally takes advantage of the general's intoxication to cut off his head. She returns inviolate to the city with his head as a trophy, and a sally on the part of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> results in the rout of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>. The book closes with a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> to the Almighty by Judith to celebrate her victory.
<h2>The text</h2>

<p>The book exists in distinct Greek and Latin versions, of which the former contains at least eighty-four verses more than the later. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Praef. in Lib.) says that he translated it from the Chaldaic in one night, "magis sensum e sensu, quam ex verbo verbum transferens" (aiming at giving sense for sense rather than adhering closely to the wording). He adds that his <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> differed much, and that he expresses in Latin only what he could clearly understand of the Chaldaic.

<p>Two Hebrew versions are known at present, a long one practically identical with the Greek text, and a short one which is entirely different; we shall return to the latter when discussing the origin of the book. The Chaldaic, from which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> made our present <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> version, is not recoverable unless it be identified with the longer Hebrew version mentioned above. If this be the case we can gauge the value of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> work by comparing the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> with the Greek text. We at once find that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> did not exaggerate when he said that he made his translation hurriedly. Thus a comparison between vi, 11, and viii, 9 shows us a certain confusion relative to the names of the elders of <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a> &#151; a confusion which does not exist in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, where also x, 6, should be compared. Again in iv, 5, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> is Eliachim, which name is later changed into Joachim (xv, 9) &#151; an allowable change but somewhat misleading: the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> is consistent in using the form Joachim. Some of the historical statements in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> directly conflict with those of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>; for example, the thirteenth year (<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>) of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> becomes the eighteenth in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, which also adds a long address of the king to Holofernes. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> has also frequently condensed the original-always on the supposition that the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> and the longer Hebrew version do really represent the original. To give but one instance: <blockquote> <em><a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> (2:27):</em> "And he came down into the plain of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> at the time of the wheat harvest, and burnt up all their fields, their flocks and their herds he delivered to destruction, their cities he ravaged, and the fruits of their fertile plains he scattered like chaff, and he struck all their young men with the edge of the sword."

<p><em>Vulgate (2:17):</em> "And after these things he went down into the plains in the days of the harvest, and he set all the corn on fire, and he caused all the trees and vineyards to be cut down." </blockquote>

<p>With regard to the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint version</a> of the Book of Judith it should be noted that it has come down to us in two recensions: Codex B or <a href="../cathen/04086a.htm">Vaticanus</a> on the one hand, and <a href="../cathen/04080c.htm">Codex Alexandrinus</a> with <a href="../cathen/04085a.htm">Codex Sinaiticus</a> on the other.
<h2>Historicity</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with very few exceptions accept the book of Judith as a narrative of facts, not as an allegory. Even Jahn considers that the genealogy of Judith is inexplicable on the hypothesis that the story is a mere fiction ("Introductio", <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1814, p. 461). Why carry out the genealogy of a fictitious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> through fifteen generations? The Fathers have ever looked upon the book as historical. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, who excluded Judith from the Canon, nonetheless accepted the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the valiant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> as historical (Ep. lxv, 1).

<p>Against this traditional view there are, it must be confessed, very serious difficulties, due, as <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Calmet</a> insists, to the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> and disputed condition of the text. The historical and geographical statements in the book, as we now have it, are difficult to understand: thus <ul><li><a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> was apparently never King of Nineveh, for he came to the throne in 605, whereas Nineveh was destroyed certainly not later than 606, and after that the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> ceased to exist as a people; <li>the allusion in i, 6, to Erioch, King of the Elicians, is suspicious; we are reminded of the Arioch of <a href="../bible/gen014.htm#vrs1">Genesis 14:1</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> makes him King of the Elumaens, presumably the Elamites, <li>the character of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> is hardly that portrayed for us on the monuments: in the <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> House Inscription, for example, his sentiments are remarkable for the modesty of their tone. On the other hand, we must remember that, as Sayce says, the "Assyrian kings were most brazen-faces liars on their monuments"; <li>the name Vagao, or the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> Bagoas, for the eunuch of Holofernes is suggestive of the Bagoses, who, according to <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Antiquities, XI, vii, 1), polluted the temple and to whom apparently we have a reference in the recently discovered papyri from Assuan; <li>the mixture of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a>, Greek, and Persian names in the book should be noted; <li>the genealogy of Judith as given in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> is a medley: that given in the three principal Greek <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> is perhaps better but varies in every one. Still it is an historical genealogy, though ill-conserved; <li>a geographical puzzle is presented by the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> of ii, 12-16; the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> is much superior, and it should be noted that throughout this version, especially in <a href="../cathen/04086a.htm">Codex B</a>, we have the most interesting details furnished us (cf. particularly i, 9; ii, 13, 28-9). The <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> also gives us information about Achior which is wanting in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>; it is apparently hinted in vi, 2, 5, that he was an Ephraimite and a mercenary hired by Moad; <li>Bethulia itself is a mystery: according to the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> it was large, had streets and towers (vii, 22, 32), and withstood a long siege at the hands of a vast army. Its position, too, is stated with minuteness; it stood on the edge of the Plain of Esdrelon and guarded the pass to Jerusalem; yet no trace of the existence of such a place is to be found (unless we accept the theory of Conder, "Handbook", 5th ed., p. 239); <li>the names, Judith (Jewess), Achior (brother of light), and <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a> (?Bethel, i.e. ?Jerusalem, or perhaps from the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> meaning "virgin" &#151; in the shorter Hebrew version Judith is called not "the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>" but "the virgin", i.e. <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>), sound rather like symbolic names than those of historical places or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; <li>in Judith's speech to Holofernes there is (xi, 12, 15) some apparent confusion between <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; <li>while the events are referred to the time of <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>, and therefore to the close of the Hebrew monarchy, we seem to have in v, 22, and viii, 18-19, an allusion to the time subsequent to the Restoration; <li>there is no king in Palestine (iv, 5), but only a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, Joachim or Eliachim; and in iv, 8; xi, 14; xv, 8 (Sept.), the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> is apparently mentioned; <li>the book has a <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> and even a Greek colouring, as is evidenced by the recurrence of such names as Bagoas and Holofernes.</ul> These are serious difficulties, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> student must be prepared to meet them. There are two ways of doing so.

<p>(a) According to what we may term "conservative" criticism, these apparent difficulties can every one be harmonized with the view that the book is perfectly historical and deals with facts which actually took place. Thus, the geographical <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> may be ascribed to the translators of the original text or to copyists living long after the book was composed, and consequently <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the details referred to. <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Calmet</a> insists that the Biblical <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> is meant, while in Arphaxad he sees Phraortes whose name, as Vigoroux (Les Livres Saints et La Critique Rationaliste, iv, 4th ed.) shows, could easily have been thus perverted.

<p>Vigoroux, however, in accordance with recent Assyrian discoveries, identifies <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> with Assur-bani-pal, the contemporary of Phraortes. This enables him to refer the events to the time of the captivity of Manasses under Assur-bani-pal (<a href="../bible/2ch033.htm#vrs11">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>; cf. Sayce, "Higher Criticism and the Verdict of the Monuments", 4th ed., p. 458). It is further maintained that the campaign conducted by Holofernes is well illustrated in the records of Assur-bani-pal which have come down to us. And these facts will undoubtedly afford an explanation of the apparent allusion to the captivity; it was indeed a Restoration, but that of Manasses, not that under Esdras. The reference, too, to the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>; the term <em>gerousia</em> is used of the "ancients" in Lev., ix, 3, etc. Lastly, Conder's identification of <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a> with Mithilia (loc. cit. supra) is highly probable. Moreover, the writer who described the strategical position in iv, 1-6, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the geography of Palestine thoroughly. And we are given details about the death of Judith's husband which (viii, 2-4) can hardly be attributed to art, but are rather indications that Judith represents a really existing heroine. With regard to the state of the text it should be noted that the extraordinary variants presented in the various versions are themselves a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the versions were derived from a copy <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from a period long antecedent to the time of its translators (cf. Calmet, "Introd. in Lib. Judith").

<p>(b) Some few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers are not satisfied with <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Calmet's</a> solution of the difficulties of the Book of Judith; they deem the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of translators and of scribes to be no sufficient explanation in this matter. These few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, together with the non-Catholics that do not care to throw the book over entirely into the realm of fiction, assure us that the Book of Judith has a solid historical foundation. Judith is no mythical personage, she and her heroic deed lived in the memory of the people; but the difficulties enumerated above seem to show that the story as we now have it was committed to writing at a period long subsequent to the facts. The history, so it is maintained, is vague; the style of composition, the speeches, etc., remind us of the Books of Machabees. A remarkable <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> is evinced (cf. 7:19 and <a href="../bible/psa105.htm#vrs6">Psalm 105:6</a>; <a href="../bible/psa007.htm#vrs21">7:21</a>, and <a href="../bible/psa078.htm#vrs10">Psalm 78:10</a>, <a href="../bible/psa093.htm#vrs2">93:2</a>; <a href="../bible/psa009.htm#vrs6">9:6, 9</a>, and <a href="../bible/psa019.htm#vrs8">Psalm 19:8</a>; <a href="../bible/psa009.htm#vrs16">9:16</a>, and <a href="../bible/psa146.htm#vrs10">Psalm 146:10</a>; <a href="../bible/psa013.htm#vrs21">13:21</a>, and <a href="../bible/psa105.htm#vrs1">Psalm 105:1</a>). Some of these psalms must almost certainly be referred to the period of the Second Temple. Again, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a> Joachim must presumably be identified with the father of Eliashib, and must therefore have lived in the time of Artaxerxes the Great (464-424 B.C. Cf. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, "Antiquities", XI, vi-vii). We referred above to a shorter Hebrew version of the book; Dr. Gaster, its discoverer, assigns this <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> to the tenth or eleventh century A.D. (Proceedings of Soc. of Bibl. Archaeol., XVI, pp. 156 sqq.). It is exceedingly brief, some forty lines, and gives us only the gist of the story. Yet it seems to offer a solution to many of the difficulties suggested above. Thus Holofernes, <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>, and Achior, all disappear; there is a very natural explanation of the purification in xii, 7; and, most noticeable of all, the enemy is no longer an Assyrian, but Seleucus, and his attack is on <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, not on <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a>.

<p>If it could be maintained that we have in this <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> the story in its original form, and that our canonical book is an amplification of it, we should then be in a position to explain the existence of the numerous divergent versions. The mention of Seleucus brings us down to <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> times, the title of Judith, now no longer the "widow" but the "virgin", may explain the mysterious city; the <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm">Machabean</a> colouring of the story becomes intelligible, and the theme is the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (cf. 6:14-21; 7:4; <a href="../bible/2ma015.htm#vrs12">2 Maccabees 15:12-16</a>).
<h2>Canonicity</h2>

<p>The Book of Judith does not exist in the <a href="../cathen/07175a.htm">Hebrew Bible</a>, and is consequently excluded from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/03267a.htm">Canon</a> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always maintained its <a href="../cathen/03267a.htm">canonicity</a>.

<p>St. Jerome, while rejecting in theory those books which he did not find in his Hebrew <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, yet consented to translate Judith because "the Synod of Nicaea is said to have accounted it as <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>" (Praef. in Lib.). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that no such declaration is to be found in the Canons of Nicaea, and it is uncertain whether <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> is referring to the use made of the book in the discussions of the council, or whether he was misled by some spurious canons attributed to that council, but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the Fathers of the earliest times have reckoned Judith among the canonical books; thus <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> seems to quote the Greek text of <a href="../bible/jth008.htm#vrs14">Judith 8:14</a>, in <a href="../bible/1co002.htm#vrs10">1 Corinthians 2:10</a> (cf. also <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs10">1 Corinthians 10:10</a>, with <a href="../bible/jth008.htm#vrs25">Judith 8:25</a>). In the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> we find it quoted as part of Scripture in the writing of <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a> (First Epistle of the Corinthians, lv), <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>.
