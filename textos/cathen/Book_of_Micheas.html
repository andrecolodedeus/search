<h1>Book of Micheas</h1>  

<p>Micheas (Hebr. Mikhah; <a href="../bible/jer026.htm#vrs18">Jeremiah 26:18</a>: Mikhayah keth.), the author of the book which holds the sixth place in the collection of the Twelve Minor <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>, was born at Moresheth (<a href="../bible/mic001.htm#vrs1">Micah 1:1</a>; <a href="../bible/jer026.htm#vrs18">Jeremiah 26:18</a>), a locality not far from the town of Geth (<a href="../bible/mic001.htm#vrs14">Micah 1:14</a>). <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was the scene of his ministry, and it occurred, as we learn from the title of his book, under the Kings Joathan (c. 740-735 B. C.), Achaz (735-727?), and Ezechias (727-698?). We do not, however, appear to possess any of his addresses prior to the reign of Ezechias. He was thus a contemporary of the Prophet Isaias. His book falls into three parts.
<h2>Part one (chapters 1-3)</h2>

<p>The first part consists of chapters 1-3. Micheas begins by announcing the impending destruction of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> as a punishment for its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> also is threatened. In chapter 2 the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> develops his threats against the Kingdom of Juda and gives his reasons for them. In chapter 3 he utters his reproaches with greater distinctness against the chief culprits: the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the princes, and the judges. Because of their transgressions, Sion shall be ploughed as a field, etc. (3, 12). This passage was quoted by the defenders of Jeremias against those who wished to punish with death the boldness with which the latter had announced <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> chastisements: Micheas of Morashti was not <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">punished with death</a>, but, on the contrary, Ezechias and the people did penance and the Lord withdrew his threat against <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/jer016.htm#vrs18">Jeremiah 16:18 sq.</a>). There is a general consensus of opinion to attribute to the Prophet Micheas the authorship of this part of the book; serious <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> have been expressed only concerning 2:11-12. Chapters 1-3 must have been composed shortly before the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Kingdom of Samaria</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> (722 B.C.).
<h2>Part two (chapters 4-5)</h2>

<p>In the second part (4-5), we have a discourse announcing the future conversion of the nations to the Law of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> and describing the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> peace, an era to be inaugurated by the triumph of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> over all its enemies, symbolized by the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>. In 5:1 sq. (Hebr., 2 sq.), the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> introduces the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> king whose place of origin is to be Bethlehem-Ephrata; <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> will only give up his people "till the time wherein she that travaileth shall bring forth", an allusion to the well-known passage of Isaiah 7:14. Several recent critics have maintained that chapters 4-5, either wholly or in part, are of post-exilic origin. But their arguments, principally based on considerations inspired by certain theories on the history of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, are not convincing. Neither is it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to suppose that in 4:8, the comparison of the citadel of Sion with the "tower of the flock" alludes to the ruinous condition of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at the time of the composition of the address; this comparison merely refers to the moral situation held towards the rest of the country by the capital, whence <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> is presumed to keep watch. The connexion of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is interrupted in 4:10, and in 5:4-5 (<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> 5-6), both of which may be later additions. A characteristic trait of Micheas's style in chapter 1 is found in the puns on the names of localities, and it is noticeable that an entirely similar pun can be seen in 5:1 (<a href="../bible/heb004.htm#vrs14">Hebrews 4:14</a>), particularly when the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">LXX version</a> is taken into account. The reading supposed by the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">LXX</a> suggests a very satisfactory interpretation of this difficult passage: "And now, surround thyself with a wall (gadher), Beth-Gader." The difference of tone and contents clearly show that 4-5 must have been composed in other circumstances than 1-3. They probably date from shortly after the fall of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> in 722 B.C. In 1-3 Micheas had expressed the fear that after the conquest of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrian</a> army would invade <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>; but ?Yahweh withdrew His threat (<a href="../bible/jer016.htm#vrs19">Jeremiah 16:19</a>), and the enemy left Palestine without attacking <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Chapters 4-5 have preserved us an echo of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> caused in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by the removal of the danger.
<h2>Part three (chapters 6-7</h2>

<p>Chapters 6-7 are cast in a dramatic shape. <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> interpellates the people and reproaches them with ingratitude (6:3-5). The people ask by what offerings they can expiate their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (6:6-7). The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> answers that <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> claims the observance of the moral law rather than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> (6:8). But this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has been shamefully violated by the nation, which has thus brought on itself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> punishment (6:9 sqq.). The passage 7:2-13 could be transposed to follow 7:6; in this way the justification of the punishments assumes a connected form in 6:6 to 7:6 and 7:11-13. The rest of chapter 7 (7-11 + 14 sqq.) contains a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in which the fallen city expresses hope in a coming restoration and confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The opinions of critics are much divided on the composition of these chapters. Several consider them a mere collection of detached fragments of more or less recent origin; but the analysis just given shows that there is a satisfactory connexion between them. The chief reason why critics find it difficult to attribute to Micheas the authorship of chapters 6-7, or at least of a large portion, is because they identify the fallen city of 7:7 sqq., with <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> never mentions <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and there is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> is the city intended. On the contrary, certain traits are better explained on the supposition that the city in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> mind is Samaria; see especially 6:16, and 7:14. According to this hypothesis, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in 6-7:6 and 7:11-13, casts a retrospective look at the causes which brought about the fall of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and in 7:7-11 + 14 sqq., he expresses his desires for its return to the Lord's favour. As in the historical situation thus supposed there is nothing which does not exactly tally with the circumstances of Micheas's time, as there is no disagreement in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> between Micheas 1 sqq., and 6-7 as on the contrary real affinities in style and vocabulary exist between Micheas 1 sqq., and 6-7, it seems unnecessary to deny to the Prophet Micheas the authorship of these two chapters.
