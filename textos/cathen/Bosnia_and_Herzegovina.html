<h1>Bosnia and Herzegovina</h1>  

<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina form the north-western corner of the Balkan Peninsula. Taking the two together as one territory, Bosnia-Herzegovina is bounded on the north by the Austrian provinces and titular kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a> and Slavonia, on the east by the Kingdom of Servia, on the south by one of the nominal provinces of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, the principality of <a href="../cathen/10529c.htm">Montenegro</a>, and the titular kingdom and Austrian province of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, and on the west by <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and Croatia. The Dinaric Alps and the Save and Drina Rivers form a large part of the boundary line of the country which in shape closely resembles an equilateral triangle. The joint territory has an area of about 19,702 square miles and belongs nominally to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire. Article 25 of the Treaty of Berlin, 13 July, 1878, granted <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to occupy and administer the two provinces. Since then they have been under the control of the Minister of Finance of the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> monarchy as crown provinces. Bosnia and Herzegovina belong, with their alternating highlands and mountain chains, to the region of the Karst mountains. The Karst region forms a part of the spurs of the southern Alps. It is a mountainous limestone district of the mesozoic period with valleys of incomplete formation. The rocky, unfruitful character of the Karst region is more evident in the southern part of the territory than in the northern, for in the north the forest-covered ranges, running chiefly from south-east to north-west, enclose fertile valleys. The only flat country is the district called Posavina, lying on the Save. There is in general a terrace-like descent from the mountainous region towards the Adriatic and the Hungarian depression.

<p>Bosnia may be regarded as a succession of great terraces, but Herzegovina, in which the mountain sides slope down towards the Narenta River, has more the shape of a basin. The former belongs to the region of the Black Sea, the latter to that of the Adriatic. The highest peaks, the Locike (6,913 feet), the Treskavica-Planina (6,851 feet), and the Bjelasnica-Planina (6,782 feet) lie near the border of Herzegovina, respectively west and south-west of <a href="../cathen/13725a.htm">Serajevo</a>. The Save is the chief river of Bosnia and its tributaries are the Una, the Vrbas, the Ukina, the Bosna, and the Drina. Herzegovina is drained by the Narenta (Neretva) River. As Bosnia falls away towards the north until it descends into the low-lying region of the Save, it is easy of access from central <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and was, consequently, exposed to incursions by the kings of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. After crossing the Saxe the Hungarian armies could penetrate into the heart of the country without encountering any natural obstacles. Bosnia was also, in consequence of the physical formation of the land, frequently divided into two parts, the upper or mountainous Bosnia, which extended to where the rivers pass into the flat country of the Save, and the Bosnian plain along the Save. The Romans observed this natural line of division and made it the boundary between the provinces of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and Pannonia. Just as the political unity of Bosnia was made more difficult by its natural configuration, so on the other hand, the development, of a compact principality was favoured in Herzegovina (called also Hum, Chulm, and Chulmo) by basin-like shape.
<h2>Physical formation</h2>

<p>Mesozoic formations appear throughout this territory especially in the shape of Triassic rooks: where there are dislocations the underlying palaeozoic rocks frequently project. These latter are made of slate, sandstone, and limestone, as for example, the famous mountain range of slate rock called Kresevo, in the western part of the Serajevo district, and the range called Posara on the Save. Jurassic rock and chalk formations appear chiefly in Herzegovina and western Bosnia. Of far greater extent are the neogenic fresh water formations containing the great coal deposits of the two territories. There is also much volcanic rock of various The climate of Bosnia is in general the usual continental one of cold winters and hot summers, while in Herzegovina the nearness of the sea makes the climate almost semi-tropical. The average yearly temperature is from 48.2&#176; to 50&#176; Fahr. The average temperature of Travnik, situated at a height of 1,640 feet in about the centre of the country, is in January 28.4&#176; Fahr., in April 50.5&#176;, in July, 68.3&#176;, and in October 50.3&#176;. Since the time of the Romans Bosnia has yielded a large amount of iron; lignite or brown coal and salt are also obtained in a number of places. Mineral and hot springs abound; among these are the hot spring at Ilidze near <a href="../cathen/13725a.htm">Serajevo</a>, the chalybeate spring at Kiseljak, and a spring impregnated with arsenic at Srebrenica. Bosnia contains a large amount of timber; 50 per cent of its area is covered with forests; 34 per cent is productive farming-land, and the remaining 16 per cent is in the rocky Karst region. The Bosnian forests are full of boars, bears, wolves, foxes, lynxes, and deer. Agriculture is of a primitive character and could be made far more productive. The chief agricultural products of the country are maize and wheat; oats, rye, barley, hemp, and buckwheat are also raised. In Herzegovina in addition to these staples wine and oil are produced and figs are cultivated.
<h2>Population</h2>

<p>According to the census of 22 April 1895, Bosnia has 1,361,868 inhabitants and Herzegovina 229,168, giving a total population of 1,591,036. The number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to the square mile is small (about 80), less than that in any of the other Austrian crown provinces excepting Salzburg (about 70). This average does not vary much in the six districts (five in Bosnia, one in Herzegovina). The number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to the square mile in these districts is as follows: Doljna Tuzla, 106; Banjaluka, 96; Bihac, 91; Serajevo, 73, Mostar (Herzegovina), 65, Travnik, 62. There are 5,388 settlements, of which only 11 have more than 5,000 inhabitants, while 4,689 contain less 500 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Excluding some 30,000 Albanians living in the south-east, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> in earlier times from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, a few Osmanli <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the merchants, officials. and Austrian troops, the rest of the population (about 98 per cent) belong to the southern Slavonic people, the Serbs. Although one in race, the people form in religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> three sharply separated divisions: the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, about 550,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (35 per cent), Greek Schismatics, about 674,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (43 per cent), and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, about 334,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (21.3 per cent). The last mentioned are chiefly peasants. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> form the mass of the population in the region called the Krajina in the north-west, in the district of <a href="../cathen/13725a.htm">Serajevo</a> and in the south-eastern part of the territory; the Greek Schismatics preponderate in the district of <a href="../cathen/02252a.htm">Banjaluka</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> exceed the other two <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> only in the district of Travnik and in northern Herzegovina. There are in addition 8,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and 4,000 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Divided according to occupation 85 per cent of the population are farmers or wine-cultivators (1,385,291). There are 5,833 large estates, the owners of which are chiefly <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, 88,970 cultivators of land not their own (<em>kmeten</em>), 88,867 free peasants who own the land they till, and 22,625 peasants who own farming-land and also cultivate the land of others. The population of the towns is small.


<h2>History</h2>

<p>There are traces of human settlements in Bosnia <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the Stone Age. The earliest inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina of whom there is any <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> are the Illyrians, an exceedingly rapacious pastoral people who were divided into various tribes. The best known of these are: a small tribe called the Liburnians living in the northwest, who were <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> pirates; the Ardiaeans living south of the Liburnians, and the Antiariats, who were neighbours of the Ardiaeans living still farther to the south. The migrations of the Celts in the third and fourth centuries before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> drove various Illyrian tribes out of their former possessions. From the third century until 167 B.C., a powerful Illyrian kingdom existed, under rulers called Agron, Teuta, and Genius, in southern <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, and the adjoining Herzegovina and Montenegro. The Romans had a hard struggle before they succeeded finally in breaking the power of the Illyrians and in getting control of Bosnia and Herzegovina (6 B.C.-A.D. 9). The sagacious Romans saw that in order to control the line of the Danube and the east coast of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to absorb the triangular shaped country of the Illyrians. No part of the peninsula contains so many traces of Roman civilization as <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and the adjoining Bosnia. The Romans built a road from Mitrovic or Mitrovitza (Sirmium) near the Save to Gradisca and continued it from Gradisea through what is now western Bosnia or <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Croatia as far as <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Salona</a>; they constructed a second road through upper Bosnia across the present district of <a href="../cathen/13725a.htm">Serajevo</a> to Domavia on the Drina, and from here to Mitrovie a third road went from <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Salona</a> to Narona (near Dubrawa) and to Scodra (Scutari). The Romans named the province <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> after the largest and bravest of the tribes living on the coast. They divided it into three administrative <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the chief cities being, respectively, <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Salona</a>, the capital of the whole province, Scardona and Narenta. The northernmost part of Bosnia, extending for some distance from the Save, was included in the province of Pannonia. The Illyrians who had been familiar only with <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and cattle-raising now turned their attention, under the guidance of the Romans, to mining, placer-mining for gold and agriculture. They became largely Romanized and for hundreds of years their legions <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> defended the empire.

<p>After the fall of the Western Roman Empire <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and Pannonia came into the possession of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> under <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">King Theodoric</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that followed (535-554) between Justinian and the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> made repeated incursions into the provinces. It may be that they were called in by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> the Avars raided the territory and in 598 turned <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> almost into a wilderness. After this the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> greatly desired the country and succeeded in taking possession during the first half of the seventh century. Among the tribes which now owned the land, the Hroati (later called Croats) lived on the Dalmatic coast and the Serbi in the interior. Up to the eighth century the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> was paramount. At the end of the ninth century when the power of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> dynasty extended as far as the south-eastern Alpine provinces, the Croats came under the influence of Western civilization and embraced <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Christianity</a>. The tribes of the interior retained the patriarchal form of government and the old <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> worship much longer than the dwellers on the coast, notwithstanding the connection which they had had for centuries with Constantinople. Bosnia seems to have belonged to Croatia as late as the beginning of the tenth century. A little later the Servian prince Ceslav (931-960) succeeded in freeing Servia from the suzerainty of <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> and built up a confederation of which Bosnia formed a part. About 955 Ceslav was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to defend the dependent <em>banat</em>, or district, of Bosnia (originally merely the valley of the upper Bosna) from an incursion of the Magyars. After the death of Ceslav and the dissolution of his kingdom Bosnia was ruled by native bans or chiefs. In 968 however, Bosnia was conquered by the Croatian king Kresimir and in 1019 the whole north-western part of the Balkan Peninsula came under the sway of the Eastern Roman Emperor, Basil II. After Basil's death Bosnia regained its independence and was ruled by native bans until it was united with the domain of Bela II, King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. In 1135 this ruler called himself for the first time King of Rama (Bosnia).

<p>During the entire reign of the Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, (1143-80) a long and fierce struggle went on between the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> on the one side and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and the southern <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> on the other; in this Ban Boris, the first ruler of Bosnia known by name, remained faithful to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. In 1163, however, Boris took sides against Stephen III in the quarrel over the succession to the Hungarian throne. He was defeated by Gottfried of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> who was sent with an army against him, and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> lost their power in Bosnia. The Banat of Boris extended from Livno and the valley of the Rama in the west to the Drina River in the east. Three years later Bosnia, Syrmia, <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> became subject to the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. After the death of Manuel I, Comnenus (1180) the new Ban, Kulin, was able to shake off the foreign yoke. But Bela III of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, desiring to make Bosnia a dependency of his own kingdom, persuaded the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to place the Bishopric of Bosnia and the Diocese of Ston in Herzegovina under the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Spalato</a>, the territory of which belonged to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Before this Bosnia had been suffragan to Ragusa. In order to counteract this indirect Hungarian control Kulin, his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and 10,000 Bosnians between the years 1190-99, became adherents of the Paterine <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. When <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> and King Emmerich of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> joined forces to exterminate the Paterines and to conquer Bosnia, Kulin preserved Bosnia's independence of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a> control by returning in 1203 to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Johannes de Casamaris. During the reign of his successor, Ban Stephen, the Paterines grew so powerful that they deposed Stephen and substituted one of their own adherents, the able Matthias Ninoslav (1232-50), who was probably related to Kulin. In 1233 Ninoslav returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, but notwithstanding this the land was filled with the adherents of the Paterine <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and in 1234-39 a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> was preached against Bosnia but was not, however, carried out. Although Ninoslav maintained his position as Ban of Bosnia, he was not able to found a dynasty and after his death his principality gradually fell to pieces. The districts of Herzegovina near Ragusa aimed at individual independence, while the rest of the territory now included in Bosnia and Herzegovina gradually came into a more complete dependence on <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>.

<p>During the reign of Bela IV of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (1235-70) upper Bosnia and the district of Posavina were formed into the Banat of Bosnia, the region in the west on the Usora into the Banat of Usora, and the region in the east on the Drina into the Banat of <a href="../cathen/14134a.htm">Soli</a> or Tuzla, while the western part of the present territory of Herzegovina, the region of the Rama, and southern Bosnia were ruled by various powerful Croatian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. At this time a relative of Ninoslav named Pryezda lived on the upper part of the Bosna River. Pryezda's son, Stephen Katroman (1322-53), was the first of the Katroman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> from which for a century and a half came the bans and kings of Bosnia. Stephen was a vassal of the kings of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, who were his relatives and members of the house of Anjou. Through this connection Stephen was able, after defeating the rulers of the present Herzegovina, to unite this territory to his domains. From the tenth century Herzegovina had formed a so-called buffer district between the Dalmatic coast and Bosnia on the one side and Servia on the other of the dismemberment of the great <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servian</a> empire of Dusan the Strong, Tvrtko, Stephen Katroman's nephew and successor, with the help of King Louis I (the Great) of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, became master of the district of the upper Drina, Trebinje, and Canale. Tvrtko now, with the consent of Louis, took the title of King of Bosnia. A few years later (1384) Bosnia and Herzegovina were laid waste for the first time by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. After the death of Louis the Great (1382) Tvrtko threw off the suzerainty of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and conquered the cities on the Dalmatie coast. During the reigns of his successors Stephen Dabischa (1391-95), Queen Helena (1395 98), Stephen Osoja (1398-1418), Stephen Ostojitsch (1418-21), Stephen Tvrtko II (1404-31) (the rival of the two last-named kings), Stephen Thomas (1443-61), and Stephen Thomaschewitz (1461-63) the kingdom rapidly declined in power so that these rulers were not able to maintain their authority over the conquered districts or to keep the insubordinate vassals and nobles in check. The nobles ruled their territories with little regard for the king; they had their own courts with state officials, granted pardons, had relations with foreign powers, and carried on bloody <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with one another.

<p>The last king, who possessed only the land on the right bank of the Bosna, sought to strengthen his position by becoming a vassal of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He hoped by this means to obtain the aid of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> countries of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in defending himself against the threatening power of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. In 1462 he refused to pay tribute to the Sultan Mohammed II; but when in the following spring Mohammed invaded Bosnia with a powerful army, the young king found himself deserted. Deceit and treason, especially on the part of the Bogomili, completed his ruin. He was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and beheaded, by the order of the sultan, July, 1463, probably near Jajce (Jaitza). The campaign of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> ended in the overthrow of the Bosnian kingdom; only Herzegovina maintained its independence. One hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> of both sexes were taken; 30,000 Bosnian youths were compelled to join the janizaries. The nobility, especially the Bogomili, became <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>. A large part of the remaining population left the country. The following year <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">King Matthias Corvinus</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> freed from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> yoke a part of Bosnia, the Banats of Jajce and Srebrenica (Srebrenitza) which belonged to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> until the battle of Mohacs (1526). Herzegovina came under the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> twenty years after the fall of Bosnia (1483). The long period of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> oppression is lightened by the daring feat of Prince Eugene, who in the autumn of 1697 after the battle of Zenta, with 4,000 cavalry and 2,000 infantry advanced towards the capital of Bosnia; as the expected rising of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population failed to take place, he retreated carrying with him 40,000 liberated <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. By the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718) the northern part of Bosnia and Servia was given to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, but the Treaty of Belgrade restored this district to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>.

<p>Among the many revolts in Bosnia against the bureaucratic rule of the Osmanli <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> that of 1830-31 under Hussein Aga deserves mention of the revolts in Herzegovina that of 1875. Article 25 of the Treaty of Berlin, 13 July, 1878, granted <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to occupy and govern Bosnia and Herzegovina. The main column of the Austrian troops (thirteenth army corps), under the command of General of the Ordnance Joseph Freiherr von Philoppovich crossed the Save into Bosnia near Brod 29 July; two days later Major-General Jovanovic entered Herzegovina with a division. As the occupation took place with the consent of the <em>Porte</em>, it was thought that there would be no fighting. But the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> population, secretly incited by Servia, rose under the leadership of the adventurer, Hadschi Loja, against the "foreign conquerors". They were joined by large bands of Arnauts from <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albania</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> troops who had received no instructions The insurgents were defeated in bloody battles at Maglaj, Zepce, Jajce, Tuzla, and other places. On the evening of 18 August the Austrian troops stood before Serajevo which was taken by storm the next day. In order to hasten the end of the revolt three other <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> army corps entered the contested district; by the end of September, 1878, both territories were subdued with the exception of a few points in the north-western part. In the <em>sanjak</em> (subdivision of a <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> province) of Novibazar <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> holds some important military positions and controls the commercial routes; the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> still retain the civil administration.
<h2>Introduction of Christianity</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced into both Bosnia and Herzegovina from <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Salona</a> at a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Many of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> which were suffragans of the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Salona</a> in the sixth century must be sought within the present limits of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is especially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the Bishopric of Bistue (<em>Bestoeensis ecclesia</em>) which was situated in the heart of the upper part of the present Bosnia. When the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> came into possession of these districts they did not interfere with the organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> nor did they persecute the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The acts of the two <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> which were held at <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Salona</a> in 530 and 532 have been preserved and these show that in the year 530 four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> existed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the second synod two new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were founded, Ludricensis (Livno), and Sarsenterensis (Sarsitero), the last named lying north of Mostar. During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that lasted twenty years between Justinian and the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a>, the latter changed their policy towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them. Only one of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> just mentioned, Bistue, survived the Slavonic invasion. Until the middle of the eleventh century Bistue was suffragan to the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Spalato</a>; in 1067 it was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/05007a.htm">Archdiocese of Dioclea</a>-Antivari, and shortly after it was made suffragan to the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/12633c.htm">Ragusa</a>. Disputes now arose between the two last mentioned <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> as to the administration of the Bosnian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>; the strife was unfortunate for it allowed the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Bogomili to gain a firm footing in Bosnia.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Bogomili was started in the tenth century by Jeremiah, also called Bogomil, a <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. His followers called themselves <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and considered their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one. In Bosnia they were named Paterines. The Paterines, or Bogomili, rejected marriage, forbade intercourse with those of other faiths, disbelieved in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, in any execution of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human beings</a>, in <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, in seeking for wealth, and in subjection to <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>. The Paterines greatly increased in number and influence in Bosnia after the accession to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Ban Kulin, and gained numerous adherents in the neighboring districts of <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a> and Slavonia and in the cities of the Dalmatic coast. A similar <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, appeared at the same time. At the beginning of the thirteenth century even the Bosnian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was an adherent of the Paterines; <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a>, therefore, deposed him in 1233 and raised to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> Johannes, a German <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> from Wildhausen in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. It is to the great credit of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> that they entered upon a successful spiritual campaign against the Paterines in Bosnia and <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> who had an intimate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the common people had even greater success. They not only brought back the population of the Dalmatic coast to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but they also extended their spiritual activity to the interior of the country. Yet notwithstanding these efforts and those of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, in spite of two Bosnian <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>, and of the transfer of the Diocese of Bosnia to the Archdiocese of Kaloesa in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was not suppressed. The formal return of the Bosnian nobles and monarchy to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> was merely superficial.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> conquest of 1463 drove a large part of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population out of Bosnia. This led the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Angelus Zojezdovic, to go before the Sultan Mohammed II to call his attention to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> inhabitants were going out of Bosnia in all directions. The sultan, not wishing to have the newly conquered province depopulated, granted as a favor to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should be allowed the free exercise of their religion. From that time until the present the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> has been the only shield of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in these two territories.
<h2>Church statistics</h2>

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> conquest the Bishopric of Bosnia had only a nominal existence. In 1735 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was reorganized as the Vicariate Apostolic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its administration confided to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. Since 1846 the country has been divided into two vicariates. Three years after the Austrian occupation <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> erected the <a href="../cathen/13725a.htm">Archdiocese of Serajevo</a> with the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/02252a.htm">Banjaluka</a> in the north-western part of Bosnia, Mostar-Duvno in the northern part of Herzegovina, and Markana-Trebinje in the southern part of the same province. The Diocese of Markana-Trebinje which was founded in 870 has no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of its own but is administered by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mostar-Duvno. The training of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> in all four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> is in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The other male <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders represented are: the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> who possess 17 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and have almost entire charge of the work of the sacred ministry in the <a href="../cathen/13725a.htm">Archdiocese of Serajevo</a> and the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno; and the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, with 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and 182 members. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> congregations are: the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, with 12 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>; the Daughters of Divine Love, 5 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, the Sisters of the Precious Blood, 9 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>; the School Sisters, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>.

<p>The Austrian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1878 has not only done much for the material prosperity of these provinces, but has also been of great assistance to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. This is shown by a comparison with earlier years. In 1850 the two territories contained 150,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inhabitants; in 1874, 185,503, in 1897, 334,142, or one-fourth of the whole population, and in 1907,334,000. About 1880 there were no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in the district between Gradisea and Banjaluka, now there are 10 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in this region. Before the Austrian ocoupation there were only 7 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in Trebinje; Trebinje has now several <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and churches. In Herzegovina 8 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 25 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 36,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have increased to 45 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 100 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 110,000 Catholies. The many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, school-houses, etc., which have come into existence since 1878 are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the advance in intelligence and religion. Both territories show how beneficent has been the action of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in the Balkan Peninsula. In the agreement made between <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> and Turkey of 21 April, 1879, the former country bound itself to protect in Bosnia and Herzegovina the religious liberty of the inhabitants as well as of temporary residents. This agreement includes <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The regulations in regard to marriage and <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, as well as the exemption of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from public services and military <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, are about the same as those in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The cemeteries are still denominational institutions and are reserved even more exclusively than in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> for the adherents of each <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
