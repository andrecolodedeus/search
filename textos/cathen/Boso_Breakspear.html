<h1>Boso (Breakspear)</h1>  

<p>Third <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth uncertain, d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, about 1181. He was a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a> Abbey and the nephew of <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a>. Though this relationship was on the maternal side, Cardella states that Boso as well as <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> bore the surname of Breakspear. He had a reputation not only for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, but also for learning, and was esteemed by contemporary writers as among the most eminent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of his age. He compiled or wrote the lives of several eleventh and twelfth century <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, among them the life of his uncle, and indulged in the lighter accomplishment of versifying, examples of his poetic powers still existing in the Cotton <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in the British Museum, in the form of metrical lives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. He followed his uncle to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and on the latter's elevation to the Papal Chair, was created by him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of the title of Sts. Cosmas and Damian, in December, 1155, and was also appointed Camerlengo of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Adrian sent Boso on a mission to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>; for what precise purpose does not transpire, but the fact is attested by the registers of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>. He also confided to him the governorship of the Castle of Sant' Angelo, being somewhat suspicious of the fidelity of the Roman populace. When <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> died in 1159, dissensions arose in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> as to the choice of his successor, the result of which was the creation of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> lasting seventeen years. Four <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in the imperial interest voted for <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Cardinal Octavian</a>, who assumed the name of <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Victor IV</a>, but he was acknowledged only by the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>. On the very day of Adrian's burial in the Vatican basilica, 5 September, Cardinal Boso, who appears to have taken the lead, withdrew with the majority, twenty-three, of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> within the fortress of Sant' Angelo to escape the vengeance of the <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">antipope</a>, and straightway elected as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Cardinal Rolando (Bandinelli) of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was not unmindful of his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to Boso, and soon (1163) promoted him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of the title of St. Pudentiana. When Alexander made his memorable journey to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to receive the submission and allegiance of the Emperor Frederick, and to ratify the "Peace of Venice" (24 June, 1177) which closed the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, he was accompanied by Boso. Alexander also entrusted Boso with a mission to <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, an event attested by the registers of <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>. Boso's name appears attached to many <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, both of <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>.
