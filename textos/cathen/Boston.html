<h1>Boston</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a>; comprises Essex, Middlesex, Suffolk, Norfolk, and Plymouth counties in the <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">State of Massachusetts</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a>, the towns of Mattapoisett, Marion, and Wareham excepted, embracing an area of 2,465 square miles.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was erected 8 April, 1808, and created an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> in 1875. When the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Boston was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extended over all New England and a mere handful of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. There are now eight <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the same territory with about 2,100,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of whom 850,000 are within the limits of the Archdiocese of Boston where the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> found a scant hundred. The growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been due mainly to the immigrants attracted by the advantages offered by the great and varied manufacturing interests of New England. The <a href="../cathen/08132b.htm">Irish</a> came first, after them the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, the Poles, the Portuguese, and representatives of nearly all the peoples of the globe.
<h2>Early history</h2>

<p>Early <a href="../cathen/08132b.htm">Irish</a> emigration to America took place in three distinct periods, from 1621 to 1653, from 1653 to 1718, and from 1718 to 1775. But the mistake must not be made, as it often is, that these immigrants were all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Many of them were not, and those who were had few inducements to settle in the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> colony where their Faith was held in detestation. Some who were sold to the Barbados in the time of Cromwell were afterwards found in the <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> settlements. One of these, Ann Glover, and her daughter had lived in Boston before she fell a victim, in 1688, to Cotton Mather's <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a> mania. In his "Magnalia" he calls her "a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> old Irishwoman, very poor, a <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> and obstinate in <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>". Robert Calef, a Boston merchant who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her, says "Goody Glover was a despised, crazy, poor old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who was tried for afflicting the Goodwin children. Her behaviour at her trial was like that of one distracted. They did her cruel. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> against her was wholly deficient. The jury brought her guilty. She was hung. She died a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>." (More Wonders of the Invisible World, London, 1700.) Other immigrants came as bond slaves or "redemptioners" and were not so steadfast in the Faith as Goody Glover. Their environment precluded any open manifestation of their religion or the training of their children in its <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> As an instance of many such may be cited the famous Governors Sullivan of <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>. Their grandfather was one of the "Wild Geese" who fled with <a href="../cathen/13478a.htm">Sarsfield</a> from <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. His son married Margaret Brown, a fellow "redemptioner", and with their six children all drifted into <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. One of their sons General John Sullivan, of Revolutionary fame, writing on 5 September, 1774, of the "Quebec Act" that gave religious freedom to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> under British rule, denounced these co-religionists of his grandfather as "determined to extirpate the race of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> from America to make way for their own cursed religion".

<p>Traces of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in New England begin with the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missioner, <a href="../cathen/02541d.htm">Peter Biard</a> among the <a href="../cathen/01039b.htm">Abenaki Indians</a> of Maine in June, 1611. Others, notably <a href="../cathen/05164a.htm">Father Gabriel Druilletes</a> (15 August, 1643), followed. About the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, the ship of La Tour, the French commander of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, which visited Boston harbor had "two <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>" on board but they did not land. In September, 1646, another French ship, commanded by D'Aulnay, also having two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on board, was in port. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> visited the governor, who entertained them at his residence. Four years later <a href="../cathen/05164a.htm">Father Druilletes</a> visited Boston to confer with General Gibbons as to the details of a trading pact and alliance with the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> French against the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>. The governor entertained him for two weeks at his home, which was on what is now Washington Street, near Adams Square (Memorial Hist. of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, II, p. xiv), and it is surmised that he said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in private there during that time. John Eliot, John Endicott and other noted men of the time were among those he met there and who united in urging him to prolong his visit though their efforts were unsuccessful. The "Andros Papers" (quoted in Memorial Hist. of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>) declare that in 1689 there was not a single "Papist" in all New England. They began to drift in soon, however, for in the Boston "Weekly Rehearsal" of 20 March, 1732, is this statement: "We hear that <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> has been performed in town this winter by an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> among some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of his own nation of whom it is not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> we have a considerable number among us." During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> one hundred <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were arrested in Boston in 1746 "to prevent any danger the town may be in" but the sheriff much to the disgust of their captors refused to hold them. In 1756 the exiled Acadians of whom nearly 2000 had landed in <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> were denied the services of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> because, as Governor Hutchinson declared, "the people would upon no terms have consented to the public exercise of religious worship by <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> priests" The Boston "Town Records" (1772, pp. 95-96) while admitting that toleration in religion was what all good and candid minds in all ages have ever practiced" excluded <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">"Roman Catholicks"</a> because their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> was "subversive of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>".

<p>With the Revolution, however, came the dawn of a better era, the upsetting of religious as well as political barriers, and the beginning of the slow but sure growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which has resulted in the wonderful change of the present. A favorite New England diversion was an annual procession, on 5 November, of the Pope and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> in celebration of the famous <a href="../cathen/07081b.htm">"Gunpowder Plot"</a>. In Boston it was usually attended by riot and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. In 1775 Washington, while at Boston, issued an order in which he could not "help expressing his surprise that there should be officers and soldiers in this army so void of Common sense" as to thus insult the religious feelings of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> with whom friendship and an alliance was then being sought. The stay of the French fleet in New England waters and the settling of some of the allies there after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> had ended laid the foundations of the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in the heart of New England. There appeared in Boston, in 1788, a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who called himself Claudius Florent Bouchard de la Poterie, "Priest Doctor of Divinity, Clerk, and Apostolic Missionary". He had faculties from the <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>, Dr. Carroll, and announced his advent in a pompous "pastoral letter". He secured the old <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Huguenot</a> church at what is now No. 18 School Street and opened there on <a href="../cathen/01315a.htm">All Saints' Day</a>, 1788, under the patronage of the Holy Cross, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in New England. The report of the celebration of the first Mass on that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> can be read in the Boston "Independent Chronicle", 6 November, 1788. To the aid of this church subscriptions were received from <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in answer to an appeal from the little French colony in Boston, sent a needed outfit of vestments and vessels for the altar. He also notified them that the Abb&eacute; de la Poterie was an unworthy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (Campbell in U. S. Cath. Magazine, VIII, 102). His conduct in Boston <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> this, and the <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>, finding he had been imposed on, sent the Rev. William O'Brien, O. P., of New York to Boston to depose de la Poterie. A violent pamphlet printed in Philadelphia (1789) followed. It was dedicated "To the new Laurent Ricci in America the Rev. Fr. John Carroll, Superior of the Jesuits in the United States also to the friar-monk-inquisitor William O'Brien", and represented de la Poterie as a victim to their wiles.



<p>After his suspension de la Poterie went to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and was succeeded in Boston by the Rev. Louis Rousselet, who was in turn suspended and went to <a href="../cathen/07044a.htm">Guadeloupe</a>, where he was killed in a revolution. In 1790 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colony numbered less than two hundred, and the Rev. John Thayer, a convert, was sent to take charge of the church which he found "dilapidated and deserted" after his predecessor's departure. Thayer had been a Congregationalist minister, and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Governor Hancock. At the close of the Revolution, being in his twenty-sixth year, he went abroad, and became a convert in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 25 May, 1783. He determined to become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in order to labor for the conversion of New England to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at St. Sulpice in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1787. He returned to Boston 4 January, 1790. The first of a genuine New England <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to enter the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, he retained much of his inherited <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritanical</a> oppressiveness, and, as Bishop Carroll said of him, he lacked "amiable and conciliatory manners" and was not a success as an administrator. Rousselet, who did not leave Boston immediately, set up a rival church and divided the little congregation, the French element siding with him and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> with Thayer. In the spring of 1791 Bishop Carroll had to visit the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> to restore unity. He was received with courtesy by all citizens and was made the guest of honor at the annual dinner of the most important social and military organization there, the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company. Governor John Hancock attended Mass as a mark of respect for him. "It is wonderful", the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> wrote, "to tell what great civilities have been done to me in this town, where a few years ago a Popish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was thought to be the greatest monster in the creation. . . . If all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> here were united their number would be about one hundred and twenty" (U.S. Cath. Magazine, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, VIII, 149).

<p>Father Thayer having failed as a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> he was relieved by the Rev. Francis A. Matignon, one of the many <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> exiled by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, and to whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> owes so much. Born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1753, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1773 and taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the College of Navarre. Having arrived in Boston, 20 August, 1792, he soon healed all the local dissensions and by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, eloquence, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and winning courtesy made an immediate success of his pastorship. In 1796 he invited his old friend and associate, the Rev. John Louis de <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a>, then an exile in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to Boston to help him, and to his great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> the call was heeded. The Abb&eacute; de <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> arrived on the third of October of that year. He remained in Boston with Father Matignon until July, 1797, when he went at Bishop Carroll's request to visit the Indian missions in <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>. On his way, he looked after the scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> between Boston and the Penobscot. According to a report then made to Bishop Carroll of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Communions of 1798 there were 210 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Boston, 15 in Plymouth; 21 in Newburyport, and 3 in Salem. Outside Boston the only important <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colony was at Damariscotta Lincoln County, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, where Roger and Patrick Hanly, two <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irishmen</a>, had settled some time before, and their descendants and friends made up the community. The leading merchants and shipbuilders of Newcastle, James Kavanagh (father of <a href="../cathen/08612a.htm">Edward Kavanagh</a>, later Governor of Maine, the hero of Longfellow's novel "Kavanagh", and the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> governor of a New England State) and Matthew Cottrill, built a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and later, in 1808, a brick structure, St. Patrick's church, for the use of their fellow <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. This was the only church in New England outside Boston. Having put these missions in order Father <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> returned to Boston and with Father Matignon exhibited heroic <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and charity during the yellow fever epidemic of 1798. By this time the old church in School Street was no longer fit for Divine service and another site on Franklin Street near Devonshire Street, was secured for $2,500. Speaking at the centennial observance (29 September, 1903) of the dedication of this church, Archbishop Williams said: "We bought that land from the Boston Theatre. Remember the site of the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was in the most beautiful part of the town at the end of Franklin Square and the theatre owned both sides of the lower part of the street. The theatre people agreed to sell us that lot at one-half what they could get for it when we bought it. And remember in that street in those days were some of the principal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the city. I remember the Bradleys, the Wigglesworths, the Amorys, and others who lived each side of the street, showing what a choice spot it was and one of the select streets of the city." The Spanish consul-general, Don Juan Stoughton, father of the Don Tomas Stoughton, who had so much to do with the building of St. Peter's, the first church in New York, lived opposite the site selected. At a meeting held 31 March, 1799, he and John Magner, Patrick Campbell, Michael Burns, Owen Callahan, John Duggan, and Edmund Connor were named the committee to take charge of the new project. From the congregation they collected $16,000. Members of the leading <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> headed by President John Adams added $11,000 to this, and from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in other places and other sources $5 500 more was received. The famous architect Charles Bulfinch, also a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, who designed the capitol at Washington and the State House in Boston, supplied the plans without charge for a brick building 80 feet long and 60 wide of Ionic style, severely simple but impressive. Ground was broken for it on St. Patrick's Day 1800 and it was ready for dedication 29 September, 1803, having cost $20,000. Prominent among this first congregation, besides those already mentioned, were James Kavanagh, John Ward, David Fitzgerald, Stephen Roberts, John Driscoll, William Daly, Daniel English, Thomas Murphy, John Hanly, Abraham Fitton, Mary Lob, and representatives of the Duport, Dusseaucoir, Dumesnil, Lepouse, and Julien <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> Bishop Carroll went on from <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> to perform the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of dedication. This visit of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> occasioned the greatest local satisfaction, and the two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> continued their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> ministrations with such success that in 1805 their flock had increased to about 500. Soon Bishop Carroll saw the necessity of having a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in Boston and desired to nominate Father Matignon for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, but the latter refused to allow his name to be considered. "The good accomplished here", he wrote, "is almost exclusively the work of Mr. <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a>; he it is who fills the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> who is most frequent in the confessional." Bishop Carroll therefore sent the name of the Rev. John Louis <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> declaring him to be "in the prime of life, with health to undergo any <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> exertion, universally esteemed for his unwearied <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and his remarkable facility and eloquence in announcing the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, virtuous, and with a charm of manner that recalled <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and disarmed <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of their prejudices". Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> was appointed 8 April, 1808, but owing to the difficulties of communication the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> did not reach him for nearly two years afterwards, when he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Boston, in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 1 November, 1810. He then went back to Boston to continue his simple, modest way of life. His old friend, Father Matignon, enjoyed honor and the esteem of all to the end of his long and useful career which came on the 18th of September, 1818.

<p>His many years of hard work at length began to tell on Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> and his physicians advised a return to his native land to escape repeated attacks of asthma. In 1823 King Louis XVIII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> nominated him to the vacant <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">See of Montauban</a>, and to the regret of all in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> he embarked for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, 1 October 1823. He remained in charge at <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a> until 30 July, 1826, when he was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Archbishopric of Bordeaux</a>. On 1 February he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. He died at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, 19 July 1836, in his sixty-ninth year. (See JOHN LOUIS DE CHEVEROUS.) During the administration of Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were introduced into the Diocese of Boston through the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the Rev. John Thayer, who, when on a visit to <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where he died in 1815, enlisted the sympathy of Mary and Catharine, daughters of James Ryan of that city, in the project of founding a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in Boston. They <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to Boston in 1817 and by direction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> went to the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Convent at <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. They made their profession, 4 October, 1819. They returned to Boston, and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was secured for them on Federal Street near the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Here they remained until 17 July, 1826, when their new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, Mount Benedict, Charlestown, was opened. This was the institution sacked and burned by an anti-Catholic mob on the 11th of August, 1834. Assisting in the work at the old School Street and Franklin Street Churches at various times were the Rev. James Romagne, a West Indian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who also looked after the Indian missions in <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, the Rev. J.S. Tisseraud, Fathers Matthew O'Brien and F.X. Brosius, an Alsatian, who opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> near Harvard University and was the only teacher of German then in Boston, also the Revs. Gabriel Richard, John Grassi, S.J., Philip Lariscy, the Augustinian, and Paul McQuade. In twenty years the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had no regular assistant. In 1817 he <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> his first <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> student, Denis Ryan, a native of Kilkenny, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In 1820 he <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> the second of his pupils Patrick Byrne, also from Kilkenny. In December, 1822, Virgil Barber (see <a href="../cathen/02286b.htm">BARBER FAMILY</a>) was raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> he opened at Claremont. <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, were sent as further recruits for the work of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> <a href="../cathen/06084b.htm">James Fitton</a>, William Wiley, who later became successful and long-lived <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, and William Tyler, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>. Churches were built in Salem, South Boston, and other places. A cemetery was purchased near Dorchester Heights, South Boston, and a memorial erected there to Father Matignon. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in compliment to Father Larisey who collected most of the funds for the purchase of the ground. There were a number of converts through the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and instruction of Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a>, notable among them being Thomas Walley, who had a private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at his residence in Brookline; Dr. Henry B.C. Greene, who was elected to the State legislature in 1841 and served for four terms, being the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> office-holder in the State; Stephen Cleveland Blythe, the Rev. Calvin White, William Wiley, afterwards a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Mrs. John C. Sefton, Samuel Bishop, Captain Bela Chase, Nicholas Hazelborn, the Barber <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and General Ethan Allen's daughter Frances, who was the first <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> from New England.
<h3 id="B">Benedict Joseph Fenwick</h3>

<p>Second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, appointed 10 May, 1825. He was born 3 September, 1782, near Leonardstown, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, Cuthbert Fenwick, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in America, being one of the original <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers of Lord Baltimore's colony in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. He was sent with his brother Enoch to <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a> in 1793, and in 1805 entered the Sulpician Seminary at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> to study for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was restored in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1806 he and his brother were among the first scholastics received. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 12 March, 1808. In the succeeding years he was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in New York, director of its first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Collegiate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, administrator and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, missionary in <a href="../cathen/14157a.htm">South Carolina</a>, and twice president of <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a>. He was then named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Boston, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Baltimore on 1 November, 1825, and took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, 3 December. There were then only two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the Revs. P. Byrne in Boston and D. Ryan at New Castle, Maine; and besides the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> only three churches. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at once started a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in his own house and, having prepared Fathers <a href="../cathen/06084b.htm">Fitton</a>, Wiley, Smith, Tyler, and Thomas J. O'Flaherty, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> them. Other students were sent to study at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Paris, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. The Rev. John Mahony was sent to take charge at <a href="../cathen/13396a.htm">Salem</a>; C. D. Ffrench, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, to Maine in 1826, and Robert D. Woodley to look after the scattered congregations in <a href="../cathen/13020a.htm">Rhode Island</a> and Connecticut. In 1828 Bishop Fenwick enlarged the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and began a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the basement, which was taught by his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students, assisted by Patrick Haney, a mulatto from the West Indies. The erection of new churches, the providing of more <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the increasing number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the promotion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and the regulation of the general <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> took up the remaining years of his life, which ended on the eleventh of August, 1846. In 1844 he was given a coadjutor, the Right Rev. John Bernard Fitzpatrick. Bishop Fenwick began, on 8 September, 1829, for the defense of the Faith, the publication of "The Jesuit, or Catholic Sentinel", one of the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers printed in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In 1843 he founded the College of the Holy Cross at <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> and entrusted it to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In 1829 he attended the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. At his death Boston had about fifty churches with attendant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, and numerous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and a portion of its original territory the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island had been erected into the new <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Diocese of Hartford</a> (28 November, 1843) Three Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, opened the first <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> in 1831. The first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was held n 1842 and was attended by thirty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of this period were all men of broad, solid culture and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Among others not named above may be mentioned the Rev. Jeremiah O'Callaghan, a native of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, whose strict views on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> brought him into conflict with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that place. He later became a tutor in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of William Cobbett and came to New York in 1830 The mission of <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, was given to his care, and there in 1834 he published a book under the title "Usury, Funds and Banking". Dr. Thomas J. O'Flaherty, a physician from <a href="../cathen/08627a.htm">Kerry</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1829. He edited "The Jesuit" for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and made a translation of <a href="../cathen/09554a.htm">Joseph de Maistre's</a> "Spanish <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>". The Rev. C. E. Brasseur de Bourbourg was for a time in the diocese and two years after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> death went to Mexico where he devoted much time to decyphering the native picture writings. In 1845 it was estimated there were 53,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the State, an increase of more than 20,000 in ten years.

<p>Third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03183c.htm">Callipolis</a> and coadjutor of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, 24 March, 1844. He was born in Boston, 1 November, 1812, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> having <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1805. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received in the local grammar and Latin <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and in 1829 he went to the Sulpician college at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. After eight years spent there as student and professor he entered the Seminary of St. Sulpice, Paris, to complete his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> course and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> there 13 June, 1840. He then returned to Boston and after a year as assistant at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the church at East Cambridge. In 1844 he was appointed coadjutor to Bishop Fenwick. He took part in the Sixth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1846 and attended the subsequent provincial councils and the first plenary council (1853), which further reduced the original limits of his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> by creating the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a> and <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>. During 1854 he paid his official visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after having suffered, together with his people the utmost indignities and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> at the hands of bigots. In July of that year the churches at <a href="../cathen/05133c.htm">Dorchester</a>, at <a href="../cathen/02347a.htm">Bath</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, were destroyed by mobs. In October, at Ellsworth, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02258a.htm">Rev. John Bapst, S.J.</a>, was taken by a band of masked men, stripped, smeared with tar and feathers, and forced out of the place. The legislature of <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> also appointed a special committee to investigate <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and the members forced their way into several institutions. From the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> Bishop Fitzpatrick received consolation and encouragement and the message to his people to "persevere under afflictions". The anti-Catholic sentiment in the community continued. On 14 March, 1859, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> boy named Thomas J. Wall was whipped for refusing to read the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Bible and recite <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in one of the Boston public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Thereupon so strong a protest was made by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> done to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the community by the system and regulations then in operation that for the first time in the history of the city a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and several <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were named on the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> committee. For many years the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was an invalid and a great sufferer, but he kept up his activities to the end and before his death on 13 February, 1866, saw the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> increased nearly threefold. In 1860 Bishop Fitzpatrick, intending to build a new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, sold the old church in Franklin Street For $115,000, the neighborhood having changed into a business centre. Among his prominent converts may be noted Josue Moody, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Erie</a>, Fathers George J. Goodwin, H. Tucker, J. Coolidge Shaw, S.J., Edward H. Welch, S.J., <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Orestes A. Brownson</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, Buckley Hastings, General Joseph W. Revere (Paul Revere's grandson), and other members of old New England <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. Chaplains in the regiments who volunteered in the Civil War were Fathers Thomas Scully, Charles L. Egan, Nicholas O'Brien, and Lawrence S. McMahon (afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>). Editors and writers were Fathers <a href="../cathen/06077b.htm">Joseph M. Finotti</a>, John P. Roddan, and <a href="../cathen/02725b.htm">John Boyce</a>.
<h3 id="D">John Joseph Williams</h3>

<p>Fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 11 March, 1866; created first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> 12 February, 1875. He was born in Boston of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> 27 April, 1822, and died in Boston, 30 August, 1907. His boyhood and early manhood were spent under the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of Bishop Fenwicl He attended the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and thence passed to the Sulpician college in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and their <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1845. He was the special friend of Bishop Fitzpatrick who made him his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> at an early age and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. James's church, where in 1842 he established the first Conferenoe of the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a> in New England. Two other rectors of this church became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: the Rev James A. Healy, appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a> in 1875, and M. A. Harkins <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a> in 1887. Shortly before his death Bishop Fitzpatrick sought to have Father Williams made his coadjutor, but he did not live to see him <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Boston was made an archdiocese in 1875, and Bishop Williams was promoted to be its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. He received as an <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary</a> the Right Rev. John Brady, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01244a.htm">Alabanda</a>, 5 August 1891, and a coadjutor with the right of succession in the Right Rev. William H. O'Connell of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, who was promoted to be Titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14775a.htm">Tomi</a> and coadjutor of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, 8 February, 1906. Archbishop Williams also saw organized, within the limits of the Diocese of Boston as it was when he was born, the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/14236c.htm">Springfield</a>, 1870; Providence, 1872; Manchester, 1884; and Fall River, 1905, and among those immediately under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> representatives of nearly every country and language of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Prominent among the memorials of his long episcopate and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> were the new Cathedral of the Holy Cross, dedicated 8 December, 1875, and St. John's Ecclesiastical Seminary at Brighton, erected in 1884, which is in charge of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>. Boston College was opened by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1863. In the same year the Carney Hospital was established through the generosity of Andrew Carney, who with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> has given it $75,000. The House of the Angel Guardian for boys, founded in 1849 by the Rev. G. F.  Haskins, in 1876 was entrusted to the care of the Brothers of Charity from <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. St. Mary's Infant Asylum was opened in 1872; the Home for the Aged by the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, in 1870; the House of the Good Shepherd in 1867, and the Daly Industrial School was made possible by the gift in 1899 of $50,000 from the Rev. Patrick J. Daly. The Home for Destitute children was opened in 1864; the Working Boys Home in 1883, and the Home for Girls in 1884. St. Elizabeth's Hospital dates from 1868, the Free Home for Consumptives from 1891 the Holy Ghost Hospital for Incurables from 1893 The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> made their first foundation in the diocese in 1873; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters, in 1884; the Religious of the Sacred Heart, in 1880; and the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> from <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, in 1890. The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> began a mission in the late sixties, and built their first church in the Roxbury District in 1871. In 1883 the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a> began their local work, and the Augustinians established themselves in Lawrence in 1861. French immigration from <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, which had been going on since 1815, began to attract special attention about 1870. In 1868 the first distinctively <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was organized in Lowell. Italian and Portuguese congregations date from 1872, the former in Boston and the latter in Gloucester. One congregation in Gloucester has a respectable section made up of Gaelic speaking Scotch from Cape Breton and <a href="../cathen/01562c.htm">Antigonish</a>. There is one German Congregation in Boston, and one in Lawrence; that in Boston, the church of <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, dates from 1836 and has the distinction of starting in 1844 one of the first <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in New England. There are also Polish, Lithuanian, and Syrian congregations in Boston. Archbishop Williams was a quiet, conservative <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, known best as an administrator. He was one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who attended the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> and helped largely to establish the American College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
<h3 id="E">William Henry O'Connell</h3>

<p>Second <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, was born 8 December, 1859, at Lowell, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, and received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in its local <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and at St. Charles's College, Ellicott City, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. He then graduated in 1881 at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> in Boston and was sent to the American College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to make his studies for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> there 8 January 1884, and returned to Boston in 1886. The following years he was stationed as an assistant at Medford, and at Boston until 1895 when he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the American College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He held this office five years, and was then appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 19 May, 1901. In the fall of 1905 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent him as a special envoy to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> in the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was decorated by the Mikado and on his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was warmly commended for the success of his efforts by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who on 26 January, 1906, named him titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14775a.htm">Tomi</a>, and coadjutor of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. On the death of Archbishop Williams, he immediately took possession of the See of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>.

<p>The Right Rev. John Brady, <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, was born at Crosserlough, County Cavan, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 11 April, 1842. He made his first studies in the local <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and then completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course at the Missionary College of All Hallows, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for the Diocese of Boston, 4 December, 1864. He served as a <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> in Boston and at Newburyport until 1868, when he was made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Amesbury. He continued in this charge until he was nominated Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01244a.htm">Alabanda</a> and Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Boston for which see he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 5 August, 1891.
<h2>Social progress</h2>

<p>"The foundation of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Boston could only be surpassed by devoting a chamber in the Vatican to a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Chapel" said William Tudor, writing in his "Letters on the Eastern States" (Boston, 1819). The records show that the notable constructive <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> social period of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> did not begin until after the Civil War. Though the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> formed a quarter of the population of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> in 1844 and two-fifths in 1853, not a single one of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ever held an elective or appointive public office in the city of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. There were only three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers in the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> until 1860. The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Member of the Common Council, John H. Barry, was elected in 1857, the first alderman, Christopher A. Connor, in 1870, and the first Member of Congress, Patrick A. Collins, in 1882. The changed conditions are shown by the fact that for ten of the past twenty-three years Boston has been ruled by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Mayors, and public memorials have been set up amid general approval to the soldier, Colonel Thomas Cass; the poet journalist, <a href="../cathen/11294c.htm">John Boyle O'Reilly</a>; and the statesman, Patrick Andrew Collins. In <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> it must be said that much of the progress thus made was owing to <a href="../cathen/05115c.htm">Patrick Donahoe</a>, who after the failure of "The Jesuit" continued in "The Pilot" (begun 2 January, 1836) the illustrations of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the defense of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. From his publication house issued for more than half a century a steady output of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature that aided materially the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his fellow <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and won for the Faith a general popular appreciation. Other periodicals and publications in the archdiocese are the weeklies "The Republic" and the "Sacred Heart Review" (Boston), "The Catholic Citizen" (Chelsea); "The Sunday Register" (Lawrence); the monthlies "Donahoe's Magazine" (Boston); "The Index" (Haverhill), the French weeklies "Le Defenseur", "La Justice" (Holyoke); "L'Etoile", daily and weekly (Lowell).
