<h1>Bourges</h1>  

<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF BOURGES (BITURIC&AElig;).

<p>Coextensive with the departments of Cher and Indre. After the Concordat of 1802 it became the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the Sees of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, <a href="../cathen/13347b.htm">Saint-Flour</a>, and Limoges, and in 1822 received as new suffragans the Sees of <a href="../cathen/15086c.htm">Tulle</a> and <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>. As <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> assigns a date subsequent to the "mission of the twelve bishops", that is, to the year 250, for the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Bourges; and as Leo, who occupied the See of Bourges in 453, was its twelfth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; Duchesne, after most careful calculation, places the episcopate of St. Ursinus, founder of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, near the close of the third century. He explains that the legend which makes Ursinus one of the seventy-two disciples seems to be of the later origin than that of <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a>, being met with for the first time in an eleventh-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. Fifteen <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> figured among Leo's successors up to the end of the ninth century: Sevitianus, &AElig;therius, Thecretus, Marcellus (all prior to 337); <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> (377-384); Simplicius (472-480); Desideratus (549-550); Probianus, Felix, Remedius, and the first Sulpicius (all in the second half of the sixth century); Austregisilus (612-624); the second Sulpicius (624-644), after whom the celebrated church of St.-Sulpice in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was named; David (793-802); and Agilulfus (c. 820-840). Among later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are: St. Guillaume de Donjeon (1200-09); the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, &AElig;gidius a Columnis (1298-1316); and Jean Coeur and during whose episcopate the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Bourges was founded.

<p>The claims of the See of Bourges to the primacy in Aquitaine are treated at length in the article on <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Pope Clement V</a> (1305-14) opposed these claims; nevertheless the See of Bourges always prided itself upon a sort of platonic supremacy and when, in 1678, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a> became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, he recognized explicitly the claims of Bourges. Even today the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Bourges retains the title of Primae of Aquitaine; in this way, the name of Aquitaine which, after the thirteenth century, disappeared from political geography (being replaced by that of Guyenne) has been perpetuated in the terminology of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1107 <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pascal II</a>, and in 1163 <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, visited the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Bourges. Many councils were held at Bourges, the principal among them being those of 1225 and 1226 which dealt with the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>; that of 1438, after which Charles VII <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> whereby the decrees of Basle were ratified in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the organization of a Gallican Church was attempted; and the council of 1528 which combated the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> encroachments favoured at Bourges on the one side by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in which <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> and Theodore Beza studied, and on the other by the court of Margaret of Valois.

<p>The following great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were located within the diocese: the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of D&eacute;ols near Ch&acirc;teauroux, founded in the tenth century, where St. Lusorius, son of the senator Leocadius, was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a>; the Abbey of St.-Satur near Sancerre, founded in 463; and that of Chezal-Beno&icirc;t founded in 1098 by Blessed Andr&eacute; of Vallombrosa, and mother-house of the great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> congregation which included the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> Abbey of St.-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s and was later merged into the Congregation of St.-Maur. St. Leman, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, who fled the persecutions of Totila, suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at Vatan in the middle of the sixth century. Louis VII (1120-80) was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Bourges, and Louis XI (1423-83) and the great Cond&eacute; (1621-86) were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at Bourges. Labbe, author of the "Collection of Councils" (1607-67) and <a href="../cathen/02717a.htm">Bourdaloue</a>, the illustrious preacher (1632-1704), both <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, were born at Bourges. The Cathedral of Bourges (thirteenth century) has beautiful windows and its <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> (fifteenth century) was built at the expense of Jacques Coeur.

<p>The places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: (1) Notre Dame of D&eacute;ols near Ch&acirc;teauroux, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> begun in the tenth century by Ebbo. The church was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pascal II</a>. <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a> when in exile lived there and received Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> visited it. (2) Notre Dame du Bien Mourir at Fontgombault. (3) The <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Ste.-Solange, <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the County of Berry. Ste.-Solange was born at Villemont, three leagues from Bourges, and suffered death to preserve her virginity. (4) Notre Dame du Sacr&eacute; Coeur at Issoudun. (5) Notre Dame de Pellevoisin, famous for the visions that date back to 1876 and concerning which <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority is still silent.

<p>In 1899, the following institutions were found in the archdiocese: 36 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in Cher and 29 in Indre, conducted by sisters, 3 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> in Cher and 2 in Indre, 1 house of refuge for young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in Cher, 2 patronages for girls in Cher, 20 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or hospices in Cher and 14 in Indre, 5 communities for the care of the sick in their homes in Cher and 4 in Indre, 1 insane asylum in Cher, 6 homes for the aged in Cher and 2 in Indre, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for deaf-mute and blind girls in Indre, and 1 home for incurables in Indre, all conducted by <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>.

<p>In 1900 the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men in the diocese were: <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Bourges; <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> at Fontgombault. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> peculiar to the diocese were: Men: Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, founded in 1854 with the mother-house at Issoudun. This house is the centre of the universal Archconfraternity of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart which has <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> in Oceanica. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a>: (1) <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of the Holy Sacrament or of St. Laurence, a congregation said to date back to the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. They are Sisters of the perpetual Adoration and teachers. (2) Sisters of Charity and of the Holy Sacrament, called de Montoire, with the mother-house at Bourges. This congregation, founded in 1662 by Antoine* Moreau, devotes itself to teaching and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> nursing. It has 150 houses of which 106 are in the Diocese of Bourges. (3) Religious of the Immaculate Mary, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> nurses and teachers, with the mother-house at Bourges. After the Revolution, the congregation took the place of the lay confraternity of the Immaculate Mary, and, subsequent to 1857 had charge of the general <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. (4) Daughters of the Sacred Heart of Issoudun with houses in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and Australia. At the close of 1905 the Archdiocese of Bourges had 652,681 inhabitants, 65 pastorates 430 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (mission churches), and 28 curacies.
