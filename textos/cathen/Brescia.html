<h1>Brescia</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of Brescia takes its name from the principal city in the province of the same name in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, between the Mella and the Naviglio. The city of Brescia contains 60,000 inhabitants and is of great commercial importance. It was founded by the Gauls, and in 197 B.C. was captured by the Romans, who called in Brixia. When, in 312, Constantine advanced against <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a>, an engagement took place at Brescia in which the enemy was forced to retreat as far as <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. During the invasion of the Huns under <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a>, the city was besieged. In 774 <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> captured it from the Lombards.

<p>The Bishops of Brescia received the title of Count from Louis II, and in consequence became civil rulers of the city and the countship. Many struggles followed, however, in particular after Arduin Lord Marcher of <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>, who had proclaimed himself King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1002), had slain the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this city of holding allegiance to Emperor Henry II. Henry, to ensure the fidelity of the citizens of Brescia, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confirm the civil liberty granted them by Arduin, which is the origin of the commune of Brescia. In the successive struggles between the Lombard cities and the emperors, Brescia was implicated in some of the leagues and in all of the uprisings against them. Memorable in the history of these conflicts is the siege laid to Brescia by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> in 1238 on account of the part taken by this city in the battle of Cortenova (27 November, 1237). Brescia came through this assault victorious. After the fall of the imperial house of Swabia republican institutions declined at Brescia, as well as in the other free cities and the leadership was contested between several powerful <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, chief among them the Maggi and the Brusati, the latter of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> party. In 1311 Henry VII laid siege to Brescia for six months, losing three-fourths of his army. Later the Scaligeri of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, aided by the exiled <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>, sought to place Brescia under subjection. The citizens of Brescia then had recourse to John of Luxemburg; Mastino II della Scala, however, expelled the governor appointed by him. His mastery, in turn, was soon contested by the Visconti of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but not even their rule was undisputed, as Pandolfo Malatesta in 1406 took possession of the city, but in 1416 bartered it to Filippo Visconti, who in 1426 sold it to the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> nobles, however, forced Filippo to resume hostilities against the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, and thus to attempt the recovery of this city, but he was defeated in the battle of Maclodio (1427), near Brescia. In 1439 Brescia was once more besieged by Francesco Sforza, captain of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, who conquered Piccinino, Filippo's <em>condottiere</em>. Thenceforward Brescia acknowledged the authority of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, with the exception of the years between 1512 and 1520, when it was occupied by the French armies. From 1796 it shared the fortunes of the republic.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Brescia is suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Legend traces the beginnings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Brescia to St. Barnabas, who is said to have made St. Anatolus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. However, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> also claims Anatolus as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by St. Barnabas. In any case, the Faith was probably brought to Brescia by way of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. During the reign of Hadrian, Brescia was the scene of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/06019a.htm">Sts. Faustinus and Jovita</a> (cf. Acta SS., 15 February). From the time of the persecutions tradition mentions the names of several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but nothing authentic is known concerning them. In the fourth century there was the celebrated <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">St. Philastrius</a>, a most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> champion of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, of whom it is related that he converted many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. He was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/06393c.htm">St. Gaudentius</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (c. 387), who erected outside the city walls the church <em>Ad Concilia Sanctorum</em>, in which the holy matron Silvia was buried later. A great number of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who ruled this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> form the fourth to the seventh centuries are inscribed on the rolls of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, e.g. St. Paul, St. Theophilis, St. Silvinus, St. Gaudiosus, St. Ottapianus, <a href="../cathen/15426c.htm">St. Vigilius</a>, St. Hercalanus, St. Poterius, St. Anastasius (610), who built the church of San Pietro, and made it the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and St. Dominic (613), who with the many gifts he received from Queen Theodolinda, erected the church called the Rotonda. Bishop Ramperto brought to Brescia the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, who constructed a church to which they transferred the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06019a.htm">Sts. Faustinus and Jovita</a>; he also took part in the Council of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> of 827. Notingus (844) was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who bore the title of Count. Landolfo II (1007) built the church of Santa Eufemia outside the walls.

<p>During the episcopate of Manfredo Lucciaga (1133), <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a> disseminated his teachings, with the result that the governors of the city all but confiscated the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the churches of Brescia. Alberto Rezzato (1213) had the Paterines to contend against; he also brought many <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> from the Holy Land. Blessed Gualla Ronio (1229), of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>, was distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Berardo Maggi (1275), a <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a>, was made Duke and Count of the city, and constructed among other works two canals diverting the waters of the Rivers Chiese and Mella, in order to furnish the motive force for many factories. Tommaso Visconti (1388) did much for the maintenance of discipline among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Under Bishop Francesco de' Mareri (1418), the preaching of <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">St. Bernardine of Siena</a> wrought a great moral reform in the city of Brescia. Pietro dal Monte (1442) adorned the episcopal palace, erected a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, and wrote various works. Paolo Zane (1481) built the shrine of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> delle Grazie and established the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for incurables. In the sixteenth century three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> succeeded each other: Francesco Cornaro (1532), Andrea Cornaro (1543), and Durante de' Duranti (1551). Domenico Bollani (1559) convened a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod (1574) in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Giovanni Dolfin (1579) seconded <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> in his work of reform, and that saint by his own desire celebrated the obsequies of Bishop Dolfin. Bishop Pietro Ottoboni (1654) was later elevated to the chair of St. Peter under the name of <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a>. Cardinal Alb. Badoaro (1706) was a very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, combating in an especial manner the <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietism</a> which had infected his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. <a href="../cathen/12614d.htm">Cardinal Angelo M. Quirini</a> (1727) was a man of great learning; he founded the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the commune, which took its name from him, and did much towards the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. During the episcopate of Giovanni Nani (1773) the French invasion took place, with the attendant pillaging of churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>.

<p>The most important churches of the city have been mentioned in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. There is still to be noted that of San Francesco, Romanesque in style, with a beautiful <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>. Noteworthy, also, is the cemetery of Brescia, dating from the beginning of the nineteenth century, containing a large watch tower.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains 79 rural deaneries, 389 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 774 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, 997 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 77 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 398 seminarists, 283 members of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, 4 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, and 8 for girls, and a population of 527,475.
