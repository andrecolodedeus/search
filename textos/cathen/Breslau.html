<h1>Breslau</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Prince-Bishopric</a> seated at Breslau, on the River Oder in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>.
<h2>History</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was first introduced into <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> by missionaries from <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. After the conversion of the Polish Duke Misiko (later Mieczyslaus) the work of bringing the people to the new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> went on more rapidly. Up to about the year 1000 Silesia had no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of its own, but was united to neighbouring <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In this way arose the first connection of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> with <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The upper part of the River Oder formed the boundary of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; all the territory which is now Silesia lying on the right-hand bank of the Oder belonged, therefore, to the Diocese of Posen, which was suffragan to the Metropolitan See of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. This part of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> was thus under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of that Jordan who was, in 968, appointed first Bishop Posen. The part of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> lying on the left bank of the Oder belonged to the territory then included in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and was consequently within the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Prague. The See of Prague, founded probably in 973, was suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Archdiocese of Mainz</a>. The Polish ruler, Boleslaw Chrobry, the son of Misiko, obtained the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> part of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> during his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of conquest, and a change in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dependence of the province followed. By a patent of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, in 995, Silesia was attached to the See of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, which, like Posen, was suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Archdiocese of Magdeburg</a>. Soon after this the Emperor <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> and Duke Boleslaw Chrobry, who was then the ruler of the whole of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, founded the Diocese of Breslau, and Breslau, together with the Dioceses of Cracow and Colberg, was placed under the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, which was founded by Otto in the year 1000. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Breslau is said to have been named Johannes, but nothing more than this is known of him, nor is there extant any official document giving the boundaries of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> at the time of its erection. However, they are defined in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of approval and protection issued by <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Pope Adrian IV</a>, 23 April, 1155, and by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Pope Innocent IV</a>, 9 August, 1245.

<p>The powerful Polish ruler, Boleslaw Chrobry, was succeeded by his son Misiko II, who had but a short reign. After his death a revolt against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the reigning <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> broke out, the new Church organization of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> disappeared from view, and the names of the Bishops of Breslau for the next half century are unknown. Casimir, the son of Misiko, and his mother were driven out of the country, but through German aid they returned, and the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were brought into better order. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Breslau from probably 1051 to 1062 was Hieronymus, said by later tradition to have been a Roman nobleman. He was followed by Johannes I (1062-72), who was succeeded by Petrus I (1071-1111). During the episcopate of Petrus, Count Peter Wlast entered upon that work of founding churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which has preserved his name. Petrus was followed by: Zyroslaus I (1112-20); Heimo (1120-26), who welcomed <a href="../cathen/11353a.htm">St. Otto</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> to Breslau in May, 1124, when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was on his missionary journey to <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>; Robert I (1127-42), who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>; Robert II (1142-46); and Johannes II (1146-49), who became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>. With the episcopate of Bishop Walter (1149-69) the history of the Diocese of Breslau begins to grow clearer. At Walter's request <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Pope Adrian IV</a>, in 1155, took the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> under his protection and confirmed to it the territorial possessions of which a list had been submitted to him. Among the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then confirmed was that of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the lands belonging to the castle of Ottmachau which had been regarded as the patrimony of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> from its foundation. During Walter's episcopate the Polish Duke Ladislaus and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were driven from home and took refuge in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; in 1163 the sons of Ladislaus returned and, through the intervention of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, received as an independent duchy the part of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> which was included at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> in the See of Breslau. Bishop Walter built a new, massively constructed <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, in which he was buried. Zyroslaus II (1170-98) encouraged the founding of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09204a.htm">Leubus</a> by Duke Boleslaw the Long. In 1180 Zyroslaus took part in the national assembly at Lenczyc at which <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the protection of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. Jaroslaus (1198-1201), the oldest son of Duke Boleslaw, and Duke of Oppeln, was the first prince to become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Breslau. Cyprian (1201-7) was originally <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Vincent near Breslau, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lebus, and afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Breslau. During Cyprian's episcopate Duke Heinrich I and his wife, St. Hedwig, founded the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/15029a.htm">Trebnitz</a>. The episcopate of Bishop Lorenz (1207-32) was marked by his efforts to bring colonies of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> into the church territories, to effect the cultivation of waste lands. This introduction of German settlers by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was in accordance with the example set by Heinrich I and St. Hedwig. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>, <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> took an active part in carrying out the schemes of the rulers by placing great numbers of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, especially Thuringians and Franconians, on the large estates that had been granted them.



<p>One of the most noted <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was Thomas I (1232-68); he continued the work of German colonization with so much energy that even the marauding incursions of the Mongols (1241) made but a temporary break in the process. His defence of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> involved him in bitter conflicts with Duke Boleslaw of Liegnitz. Thomas began the construction of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> being the first part erected. St. Hedwig died during his episcopate; and he lived until the process of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> was completed, but died before the final solemnity of her elevation to the altars of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After Thomas I, Ladislaus, a grandson of St. Hedwig, and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, was Administrator of the Diocese of Breslau until his death in 1270. He was followed by Thomas II (1270-92), who was involved for years in a violent dispute with Duke Henry IV as to the prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>. In 1287 a reconciliation was effected between them at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and in 1288 the duke founded the collegiate church of the Holy Cross at Breslau. Before his death, on the Eve of St. John in 1290, the duke confirmed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to sovereignty over the territories of Neisse and Ottmachau. Thomas II <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; he was present at the cumenical Council of Lyons (1274) and in 1279 held a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod. Johann III, Romka (1292-1301), belonged to the Polish party in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. His maintenance of the prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> brought him, also, into conflict with the temporal rulers of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>; in 1296 he called a synod for the defence of these <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. In the election of Heinrich I, of W&uuml;rben (1302-19), the German party in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter won, but this victory cost the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the enmity of the opposing faction. He was made guardian of the youthful Dukes of Breslau, and this appointment, together with the factional disputes, led to the bringing of grave accusations against him. The researches of more recent times have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the groundlessness of these attacks. He was kept in <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> a number of years by a suit before the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> which was finally settled in his favour. Notwithstanding the troubles of his life he was energetic in the performance of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. He carried on the construction of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and in 1305 and 1316 held <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. The office of Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Breslau dates from his episcopate. After his death a divided vote led to a vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The two candidates, Weit and Lutold, elected by the opposing factions, finally resigned, and <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> transferred Nanker, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, to Breslau (1326-41).

<p>The constant division and subdivision of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesian</a> territory into small principalities for the members of the ruling <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> resulted in a condition of weakness that necessitated dependence on a stronger neighbour, and Silesia thus came, from the year 1327, under the control of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. A quarrel broke out between Bishop Nanker and the suzerain of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, King John of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, when the king seized the castle of Militsch which belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the king and those members of the Council of Breslau who sided with him. On account of this he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee from Breslau and take refuge in Neisse, where he died. Preczlaus of Pogarell (1341-1376) was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> while pursuing his studies at Bologna, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. Through his friendship with Carl, the son of King John, he was soon able to settle the discord that had arisen under his predecessor. The diocese prospered greatly under his rule. He bought the Duchy of Grottkau from Duke Boleslaw of Brieg and added it to the episcopal territory of Neisse. The Bishops of Breslau had, therefore, after this the titles of Prince of Neisse and Duke of Grottkau, and took precedence of the other Silesian rulers who held principalities in xxx. Carl IV, the emperor at this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, wished to separate Breslau from the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and to take make it a suffragan of the newly erected Archbishopric of Prague, but the plan failed, owing to the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>. Preczlaus added to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> the beautiful Lady Chapel, in which he was buried and where his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> still exists. Dietrich, dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, who was elected as successor to Preczlaus, could not obtain the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation, and the Bishop Olm&uuml;tz, who was chosen in his place, soon died. After a long contest with the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> King and German Emperor Wenzel, Bishop Wenzel of Lebus, Duke of Liegnitz, was transferred to Breslau (1382-1417). The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> devoted himself to repairing the damage inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Silesia by the despotic procedure of the Emperor Wenzel. He held two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, in 1410 and 1415, with the object of securing a higher standard of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>; and he settled the right of inheritance in the territory under his dominion by <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> the church <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> called "Wenzel's law". Resigning his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 1417, Wenzel died in 1419. The episcopate of Conrad, Duke of Oels, the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1417-47), fell in the trying time for Silesia of the Hussite <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. Conrad was placed at the head of the Silesian confederation which was formed to defend the country against hostile incursions. In 1435 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of which the chief intent was to close the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> in the Diocese of Breslau to foreigners, and thus prevent the Poles from obtaining these offices. The effort to shut out the Polish element and to loosen the connection with Gnesen was not a momentary one; it continued, and led gradually to a virtual separation from the Polish archdiocese some time before the formal separation took place. The troubles of the times brought the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the diocese into serious pecuniary difficulties, and in 1444 Conrad resigned, but his resignation was not accepted, and he resumed his office. In 1446 he held a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod and died in the following year. Conrad's successor was the provost of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Breslau, Peter Novak (1447-56). By wise economy Bishop Peter succeeded in bringing the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> finances into a better condition and was able to redeem the greater part of the church lands which his predecessor had been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to mortgage. At the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod of 1454 he endeavoured to suppress the abuses that had arisen in the diocese.

<p>Jodokus of Rosenberg (1456-67) was a <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> nobleman and <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">Grand Prior</a> of the Knights of St. John. His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of peace made his position a very difficult one during the fierce ecclesiastico-political contention that raged between the Hussite King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, George of Podiebrad, and the people of Breslau, who had taken sides with the German party. Jodokus was followed by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from the region of the Rhine, Rudolf von R&uuml;desheim (1468-82). As <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Rudolf had become popular in Breslau through his energetic opposition to George of Podiebrad; for this reason the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter requested his transfer from the small <a href="../cathen/09049a.htm">Diocese of Lavant</a> in Carinthia, after he had confirmed their privileges. From this time these privileges were called "the Rudolfian <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>". Under his leadership the party opposed to Podiebrad obtained the victory, and Rudolf proceeded at once to repair the damage which had been occasioned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during this strife; mortgaged church lands were redeemed; in 1473 and 1475 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held, at which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> took active measures in regard to church discipline. As coadjutor, he had selected a Swabian, Johann IV, Roth, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09049a.htm">Lavant</a>, a man of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> training. Urged by <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">King Matthias of Hungary</a>, to whom Silesia was then subject, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, somewhat unwillingly, chose the coadjutor as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1482-1506). His episcopate was marked by violent quarrels with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. But at the same time he was a promoter of art and learning, and strict in his conception of church <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. He endeavoured to improve the spiritual life of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by holding a number of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. Before he died the famous worker in bronze, <a href="../cathen/15475a.htm">Peter Vischer</a> of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, cast his monument, the most beautiful <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>. His coadjutor with right of succession was Johann V (1506-20), a member of the noble Hungarian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Turzo. Johann V took an active part in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of the time and sought at the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> to promote learning and church discipline, and to improve the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. On the ruins of the old stronghold of Fauernig he built the castle called Johannisberg, now the summer residence of the Prince-Bishop of Breslau.

<p>The religious disturbances of the sixteenth century began to be conspicuously apparent during this episcopate, and soon after Johann's death <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> began to spread in <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, which country had, since 1526, belonged to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Princes, nobles, and town councils were <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoters of the new <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>; even in the episcopal principality of Neisse-Grottkau <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> doctrines found approval and acceptance. The successors of Johann V were partly responsible for this condition of affairs. Jacob von Salza (1520-39) was personally a stanch adherent of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; yet the gentleness of his disposition <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to shrink from carrying on a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the powerful religious movement that had arisen. To an even greater degree than Jacob von Salza his successor, Balthasar von Promnitz (1539-63), avoided coming into conflict with <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. He was more friendly in his attitude to the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> than any other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Breslau. Casper von Logau (1562-74) showed at first greater energy than his predecessor in endeavouring to compose the troubles of his distracted diocese, but later in his episcopate his attitude towards <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> and his slackness in defending church <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> gave great offence to those who had remained true to the Faith. These circumstances make the advance of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> easy to understand. At the same time it must be remembered that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, although also secular rulers, had a difficult position in regard to spiritual matters. At the assemblies of the nobles, and at the meetings of the diet, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the deputies of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter were, as a rule, the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> against a large and powerful majority on the side of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The Austrian suzerains, who lived far from <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, and who were constantly preoccupied by the danger of a <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> invasion, were not in a position to enforce the edicts which they issued for the protection of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The Silesian <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had in great measure lost their high concept of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, although there were honourable exceptions. Among those faithful were the majority of the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Breslau; they distinguished themselves not only by their learning, but also by their religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. It was in the main due to them that the diocese did not fall into spiritual ruin. The chapter was the willing assistant of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the reform of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Martin von Gerstmann (1574-85) began the renovation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the special means by which he hoped to attain the desired end were: the founding of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, visitations of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and the introduction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. His successor, Andreas von Jerin (1585-96), a Swabian who had <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the German College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, followed in his footsteps. At the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod of 1592 he endeavoured to improve church discipline. Besides his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in elevating the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he was also a promoter of the arts and learning. The silver altar with which he adorned his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> still exists, and he brought the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the principality of Neisse into a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> also rendered important services to the emperor, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, at various times. Bonaventura Hahn, elected in 1596, as the successor of Andreas von Jerin, was not recognized by the emperor and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to resign his position. The candidate of the emperor, Paul Albert (1599-1600), occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> only one year. Johann VI (1600-8), a member of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Silesia named von Sitsch, took more severe measures than his predecessors against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, in the hope of checking it, especially in the episcopal principality of Neisse-Grottkau.

<p>Bishop Carl (1608-24), Archduke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, had greater success than his predecessor after the first period of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> had taken a turn favourable to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party. The battle of the White Mountain (1620) broke not only the revolt in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, but also the opposition of the allied <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of Silesia. Bishop Carl began the restoration of the principality of Neisse to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The work was completed by his successor, Carl Ferdinand, Prince of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1625-55). Carl Ferdinand spent most of his time in his own country, but appointed excellent administrators for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, such as the Coadjutor-Bishop Liesch von Hornau, and Archdeacon Gebauer. Imperial commissioners gave back to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> those church buildings in the chief places of the principalities which had become the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the sovereign through the extinction of xxx. According to the terms of the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, the remaining churches, 693 in number, of such territories were secularized in the years 1653, 1654, and 1668. This led to a complete reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who effected it was <a href="../cathen/13205a.htm">Sebastian of Rostock</a>, a man of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> birth who was <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (1656-62) and Archduke Carl Joseph (1663-64), neither of whom lived in the territory of Breslau. After <a href="../cathen/13205a.htm">Sebastian of Rostock</a> became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1664-71) he carried on the work of reorganization with still greater success than before. Friedrich, Landgrave of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">Grand Prior</a> of the Order of St. John, was the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Breslau (1671-82). The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> origin and had become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Under his administration the rehabilitation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> went on. He beautified the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and elaborated its services. For the red cap and violet almutium of the canons he substituted the red <a href="../cathen/10624b.htm">mozetta</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in a beautiful <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> which he had added to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his ancestress, St. Elizabeth of Thuringia. After his death the chapter presented Carl von Liechtenstein, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>, for confirmation. Their choice was opposed by the emperor, whose candidate was the Count Palatine Wolfgang of the ruling <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Pfalz-Neuburg. Count Wolfgang died, and his brother Franz Ludwig (1683-1732) was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The new ruler of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was at the same time <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Worms, Grand Master of the German Knights, Provost of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, and Elector of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and later, he was made Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. He separated the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration and that of the civil tribunals, and obtained the definition, in the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> of 1699, of the extent of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the vicariate-general and the consistory. In 1675, upon the death of the last reigning duke, the Silesian Duchy of Liegnitz-Brieg-Wohlau lapsed to the emperor, and a new secularization of the churches begun. But when Charles XII of Sweden secured for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to their former possessions in these territories, by the treaty of Altranst&auml;dt, in 1707, the secularization came to an end, and the churches had to be returned. The Emperor Joseph I endeavoured to repair the loss of these buildings to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> by founding the so-called Josephine vicarships.

<p>The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Philip, Count von Sinzendorf, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Raab (1732-47), owed his elevation to the favour of the emperor. During his episcopate the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was added to the territory of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. King <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (Frederick the Great) desired to erect a "Catholic Vicarite" at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, which should be the highest spiritual authority for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. This would have been in reality a separation from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the project failed through the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Bishop Sinzendorf had neither the acuteness to perceive the inimical intent of the king's scheme, nor sufficient decision of character to withstand it. The king desired to secure a successor to Sinzendorf who would be under royal influence. In utter disregard of the principles of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and heedless of the protests of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, he presented Count Philip Gotthard von Schaffgotsch as coadjutor-bishop. After the death of Cardinal Sinzendorf the king succeeded in overcoming the scruples of the Holy Father, and Schaffgotsch became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Breslau (1748-95). Although the method of his elevation caused the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be regarded with suspicion by many strict <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, yet he was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the fulfilment of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. During the Seven Years War he fell into discredit with Fredrick on account of his firm maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the return of peace did not fully restore him to favour. In 1766 he fled to the Austrian part of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in order to avoid confinement in Oppeln which the king had decreed against him. After this Frederick made it impossible for him to rule the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> part of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and until the death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> this territory was ruled by <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>.

<p>The former coadjutor of von Schaffgotsch, Joseph Christian, Prince von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein (1795-1817), succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. During this episcopate the temporal power of the Bishops of Breslau came to an end through the secularization, in 1810, of the church estates in <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>. Only the estates in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> remained to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> foundation, eight collegiate foundations, and over eighty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were suppressed, and their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> confiscated. Only those monastic institutions which were occupied with teaching or nursing were allowed to exist. Bishop Joseph Christian was succeeded by his coadjutor, Emmanuel von Schimonsky. The affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had been brought into order by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De salute animarum", issued in 1821. Under its provisions the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter elected Schimonsky, who had been administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as the first Exempt <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Breslau (1824-32). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> received for himself and his successors the title of prince as partial compensation for the loss of the secularized principality of Neisse. He combated the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> tendencies which were rife among his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> and the use of Latin in the church services and ceremonies. During the episcopate of his predecessor the Government had <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a law which was a source of much trouble to Schimonsky and his immediate successors; this was that in those places where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were few in number, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> should be declared extinct, and the church buildings given to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. In spite of the protests of the episcopal authorities, over one hundred church buildings were lost in this way. King Frederick William put an end to this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and sought to make good the injuries inflicted. For several years after Schimonsky's death the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>. It was eventually filled by the election, through Government influence, of Count Leopold von Sedlnitzki (1836-40). Bishop von Sedlnitzki was neither clear nor firm in his maintenance of the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; on the question of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, which had become one of great importance, he took an undecided position. At last, upon the demand of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>, he resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. He went afterwards to <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, where he was made a privy-councillor, and where he later became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, Dr. Ritter, administered the diocese for several years until the election of the Grand Dean of the countship of Glatz, Joseph Knauer (1843-44). The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was seventy-nine years old, lived only a year after his appointment.

<p>His successor was <a href="../cathen/04786b.htm">Melchior, Freiherr von Diepenbrock</a> (1845-53). This episcopate was the beginning of a new religious and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life in the diocese. During the revolutionary period the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> not only maintained order in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, which was in a state of ferment, but was also a supporter of the Government. He received unusual honours from the king and was made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He died 20 January, 1853, at the castle of Johannisberg and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His successor, Heinrich F&ouml;rster (1853-81) carried on his work and completed it. Bishop F&ouml;rster gave generous aid to the founding of churches, monastic institutions, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The strife that arose between <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">the Church and the State</a> brought his labours in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> part of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to an end. He was deposed by the State and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave Breslau and retire to the castle of Johannisberg. Here he died, 20 October, 1881. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Breslau. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> appointed as his successor in the disordered diocese Robert Herzog (1882-86), who had been delegate of the prince-bishop and <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of St. Hedwig's at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>. Bishop Herzog made every endeavour to bring order out of the confusion into which the quarrel with the State during the immediately preceding years had thrown the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Unfortunately, his episcopate was but short duration; he died after a long illness, 26 December, 1886. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> appointed as his successor a man who had done much to allay the strife between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, George Kopp. Bishop Kopp was born, 25 July, 1837, at Duderst&auml;dt in the <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Diocese of Hildesheim</a>; he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, 29 August, 1862; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and installed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, 27 December, 1881; transferred to Breslau, 9 August, 1887, installed 20 October, 1887; created a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, 16 January, 1893.
<h2>Extent and statistics of the diocese</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Breslau includes the whole <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Province of Silesia with the exception of a part of the districts of Ratibor and Leobsch&uuml;tz, which belong to the <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Archdiocese of Olm&uuml;tz</a>, and the Countship (<em>Grafschaft</em>) of Glatz, also in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Silesia, which is subject to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>. In Austrian Silesia the Diocese of Breslau includes the Principality of Teschen and the Austrian part of the Principality of Neisee. In the Province of Brandenburg the diocese still includes the districts of Schwiebus-Z&uuml;llichau and Krossen, as well as the part formerly called Nieder-Lausitz. With the exception of the districts of B&uuml;tow and Lauenburg, the rest of <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a> and the Province of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> have, since 1821, been supervised by delegation from the Prince-Bishop of Breslau. (See <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">BERLIN</a>, <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">BRANDENBURG</a>.)

<p>Including the district governed by delegation the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains, according to the last census (1 December, 1905), 3,342,221 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 8,737,746 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; and 204,749 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. There are actively employed in the diocese 1,632 secular, and 121 regular, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter includes the two offices of <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and dean, and has 10 regular, and 6 honorary, canons. The prince-bishopric is divided into 11 commissariates and 99 archpresbyterates, in which there are 992 cures of various kinds (<a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, curacies, and stations), with 935 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and 633 dependent and mother-churches. Besides the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Breslau, the diocese possesses, as episcopal institutions for the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 5 preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for boys, 1 home (recently much enlarged) for <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students attending the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<h2>University of Breslau</h2>

<p>The founding of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at Breslau was first debated in 1409, when the Czech made it impossible for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> to continue their studies at the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">University of Prague</a> and virtually drove them from it. But Leipzig and not Breslau obtained the new seat of learning. About a century later, under the quickening impulse of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>, the project was again taken up by the city of Breslau in conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Johann Roth, and his coadjutor, Johann Turzo, and a "generale literarum gymnasium" to contain all four faculties was planned. The charter of this institution had been signed at Ofen, 20 July, 1505, by King Ladislaus of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, to which Silesia then belonged, when the <a href="../cathen/04465a.htm">University of Cracow</a>, fearing competition, succeeded in bringing the scheme to naught. The efforts made in 1527 by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to found a <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesian</a> University at Liegnitz and in 1616 at Beuthen also failed. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> sought to establish a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the endeavour led to the founding at Breslau, in 1565, of a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> which was transferred in 1575 to Neisse. In 1623 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Breslau, Archduke Carl of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, founded at Neisse a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> to which he gave a large endowment. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> intended to unite with this college a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> having departments of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> and medicine, but his death soon after the founding of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> prevented the carrying out of these plans.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> founded by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Breslau in 1659 was more fortunate in its development. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> conducted in the imperial citadel a gymnasium, the higher classes of which corresponded to those in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> department of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Theological studies were introduced in 1666. These two courses were carried on as in a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> had no power to confer degrees. In order to obtain the charter <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the conferring of degrees and for the development of the institution, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Father Wolf sought, from 1694 on, to obtain the consent of Emperor Leopold I to the erection of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> into a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Father Wolf was also active in the negotiations between the courts of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> concerning the concession of the title of King to the Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg. The plans Father Wolf sought to carry out were far-reaching. He held it a misfortune that <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesians</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> outside of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> often had no opportunity for the exercise of their religion. His scheme was a national Silesian <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, endowed with all the academic privileges, which should be open to students irrespective of their religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. This project encountered the opposition of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> prejudice against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and the town council of Breslau prevented the imperial confirmation of the plan for eight years. However, Leopold I signed at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 21 October, 1702, the charter raising the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and obtained the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation for the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>.

<p>The new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, called after the emperor, Leopoldina, was opened 15 November, 1702, but the change in status did not alter the internal organization. The buildings of the old citadel had long been too cramped for the needs of the institution, and it was resolved to erect a large new edifice, the cornerstone of which was laid 6 April, 1728. On account of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Frederick the Great of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and his conquest of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, the plans for the new structure could not be carried out in their entirety. Although efforts were made to open departments of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and medicine, nothing more was attained than unofficial lectures by instructors in these branches. The number of scholars during the first decade of the life of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> continually increased. In 1740, 1,300 students attended the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and gymnasium; the number declined during the first Silesian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> then rose again, until the Seven Years War once more reduced the attendance at lectures. During this latter conflict the building was used as a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and professors and students were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go elsewhere. Only after the Peace of 1763 was the building restored to its original use. The attendance increased rapidly during the next ten years, but fell off greatly after the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a>. In 1803, when the Leopoldina was made a secular institution, the number of students was about 500.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> the king established a Catholic-Schools Institute which included the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> living in <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, and in which the candidates for the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priesthood</a> were to receive their training. The former independence disappeared and the institute and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> were made dependent on the Silesian minister. The new institution maintained with difficulty what was already in existence; it was ruled by a spirit of narrow conservatism, and made no attempt to develop its courses or to enter new fields. Besides this, the teaching force was not well kept up even in the usual branches of learning. During the last decade of its existence the Leopoldina was carried on under the royal ordinance issued 26 July, 1800, in regard to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Breslau and the gymnasia connected with it. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system, especially the gymnasia, underwent a reform at this epoch which led to the separation of the gymnasium from the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty. These two changes were carried out in 1811.

<p>The founding of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> in 1810 made uncertain the future existence of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> on the Oder, not far from <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>. There was also a strong desire in Silesia for a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> embracing all faculties, and King Frederick William III gave his consent, 3 August, 1811, to a "plan for uniting the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Breslau". The two <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> were to be made one institution in regard to constitution, teaching staff, endowments, <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and income; the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculties were to form one body. "To satisfy the wishes of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects" two professors of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> proper were appointed, one <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The promise of the erection of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> professorship of history was not carried out until 1855, in the reign of Frederick William IV. Outside of these positions religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> was not to be taken into consideration in appointments to the faculties of philosophy, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and medicine. Instruction from both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was until then unheard of. The plan of union <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the king decreed "that the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> department of the combined <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> should be divided into two faculties, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> one. These two faculties, of equal rank in other respects, were to alternate in precedence from year to year in the matter of lecture-announcements, on academic occasions, and in affixing signatures. The public opening of the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> took place 19 October, 1811, the lectures began 21 October. In the second year of the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> patriotism led the great majority of the students to take part in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> called "the War of Liberation", and many of them died for their country. After peace was concluded the usual life of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was resumed. In August, 1861, the semi-centennial of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was celebrated with much pomp. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of learning shared in the great development of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of 1866 and 1870, 1871, and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Breslau received, through the increase of prosperity, many improvements in equipment. The departments of medicine and natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> deserve special mention.

<p>The increase in the number of students has kept pace with the increase in the number of instructors. When the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was opened, in 1811, there were 35 regular professors, 4 assistant professors, 4 docents, and 8 lecturers and technical teachers; in 1861, at the time of the semi-centennial celebration, there were 41 regular professors, 11 assistant professors, 33 docents, and 12 lecturers and technical teachers; in 1906 there were 73 regular professors, 31 assistant professors, 66 docents, and 15 lecturers and technical teachers. In the first year of the institution there were 298 students; in the fiftieth, 775; and in 1906 the number reached 1,961. Of this last number, 241 attended the lectures of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty; 565 attended the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> course; 271, the medical course; 807, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> course. The German students numbered 1,884; foreign students, 77. Besides matriculated students, permission to attend the lectures was granted to 285 other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of whom 179 were <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.
