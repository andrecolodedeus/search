<h1>Brethren of the Common Life</h1>  

<p>A community founded by <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Geert De Groote</a>, of rich burgher stock, born at Deventer in Gelderland in 1340; died 1384. Having read at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, he took orders and obtained preferment &#151; a canon's stall at <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> and another at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>. His relations with the German <em>Gottesfreunde</em> and the writings of <a href="../cathen/13280c.htm">Ruysbroek</a>, who later became his friend, gradually inclined him to <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, and on recovering from an illness in 1373 he resigned his <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, bestowed his goods on the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> of Arnheim, and lived in solitude for seven years. Then, feeling himself constrained to go forth and preach, he went from place to place calling men to repentance, proclaiming the beauty of Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and bewailing the relaxation of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and the degradation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The effect of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> was marvellous; thousands hung on his lips. "The towns", says Moll, "were filled with devotees; you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by their silence, their <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> during Mass, their mean attire, their eyes, flaming or full of sweetness." A little band of these attached themselves to <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Groote</a> and became his fellow-workers, thus becoming the first "Brethren of the Common Life". The reformer, of course, was opposed by the clerks whose <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lives he denounced, but the cry of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was raised in vain against one who was no less <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for purity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than for purity of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. The best of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> enrolled themselves in his brotherhood, which in due course was approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Groote</a>, however, did not live long enough to perfect the work he had begun. He died in 1384, and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/12631b.htm">Florence Radewyns</a>, who two years later founded the famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15651a.htm">Windesheim</a> which was thenceforth the centre of the new association.

<p>The Confraternity of the Common Life resembled in several respects the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghard and Beguine</a> communities which had flourished two centuries earlier and were then decadent. The members took no <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, neither asked nor received <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; their first aim was to cultivate the interior life, and they worked for their daily bread. The houses of the brothers and sisters alike occupied themselves exclusively with literature and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> also with preaching. When <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Groote</a> began, learning in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> was as rare as virtue; the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a> had not yet been founded, and the fame of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> was only a memory. Save for a clerk here and there who had studied at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> or Cologne, there were no scholars in the land; even amongst the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there were many who were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Latin, and the burgher was quite content if when his children left <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> they were able to read and write. <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Groote</a> determined to change all this, and his disciples accomplished much. Through their unflagging toil in the scriptorium and afterwards at the press they were able to multiply their spiritual writings and to scatter them broadcast throughout the land, <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> with the spirit of the "Imitation". Amongst them are to be found the choicest flowers of fifteenth-century <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> prose. The Brethren spared no pains to obtain good masters, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> from foreign parts, for their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, which became centres of spiritual and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life; amongst those whom they trained or who were associated with them were men like <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>, Dierick Maertens, Gabriel Biel, and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a>.

<p>Before the fifteenth century closed, the Brethren of the Common Life had studded all <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in which the teaching was given for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Gradually the course, at first elementary, embraced the humanities, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders looked askance at these Brethren, who were neither <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> nor <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, but the Brethren found protectors in Popes <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>. The great <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a> had been their pupil and became their stanch protector and benefactor. He was likewise the patron of <a href="../cathen/01231b.htm">Rudolph Agricola</a>, who in his youth at Zwolle had sat at the feet of <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>; and so the Brethren of the Common Life, through Cusa and <a href="../cathen/01231b.htm">Agricola</a>, influenced <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> and other adepts in the New Learning. More than half of the crowded <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> &#151; in 1500 Deventer counted over two thousand students &#151; were swept away in the religious troubles of the sixteenth century. Others languished until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, while the rise of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, the creation of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and the competition of new teaching orders gradually extinguished the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> that regarded Deventer and Windesheim as their parent establishments. A life of <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">De Groote</a> is to be found among the works of <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>.
