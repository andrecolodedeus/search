<h1>Brook of Cedron</h1>  

<p>[<a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>N&aacute;h&aacute;l Qidhr&ocirc;n</em>, "W&acirc;di Qidron"; only once "fields of Qidron"; <a href="../bible/joh018.htm">John 18:1</a>, <em>ho cheimarros ho Kedron</em>; in R.V., Kidron]. The name designates in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> the ravine on the east of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, between the Holy City and the Mount of Olives. The word <em>Cedron</em> is usually connected with the root <em>Qad&aacute;r</em>, "to be dark", and taken to refer to the colour of the stream or ravine; but its exact origin and precise meaning are really unknown. The Valley of Cedron begins with a slight depression near the Tombs of the Judges, a mile and a quarter north-west of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. It runs first south towards the Holy city, and then turns nearly east, passing to the north of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Kings. Next, it bends to the right towards the south, deepening as it follows this general direction between <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the Mount of Olives. Opposite St. Stephen's gate, it is fully 100 feet deep and about 400 feet broad; its bed is shaded by venerable olive-trees and crossed by an old bridge. Below the bridge, the valley presents the first traces of a torrent bed. It narrows gradually and sinks more rapidly leaving to the east the church of the <a href="../cathen/14774a.htm">tomb of the Blessed Virgin</a>, and next, Gethsemani. A thousand feet from the old bridge, the valley is merely a deep gulley across which another bridge is thrown, and on the banks of which are, to the right, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, and to the left, the sepulchres of Josaphat, <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, St. James, and the Jewish cemetery. About a thousand feet farther, there is in a cave, on the right bank, the Fountain of the Virgin, and higher up, on the left, the village of Siloe. Somewhat farther down, the Tyropoeon valley falls from the right into the Cedron, which now expands down to the Valley of Hinnom. Here, the Cedron is about 200 yards wide, and has on its left the Mount of Offence. Shortly after the junction of the Valley of Hinom with the Cedron, there is Job's well, to the south of which Sir C. Warren found, in 1868-69, the shaft of a great rock-cut aqueduct.

<p>On leaving the Holy City, the Valley of the Cedron runs its winding and gradually precipitous course through the Wilderness of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> to the north-western shore of the Dead Sea. The Cedron is perfectly dry during the summer and most of the winter. North of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, it bears the name of <em>W&acirc;di al-Jos</em> (Valley of Nuts); between the city and the Mount of Olives, it is known as <em>W&acirc;di Sitti Mariam</em> (Valley of St. Mary), or again as the Valley of Josaphat (cf. Joel, iii, 2, 12); after leaving <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, it is called <em>W&acirc;di en-N&acirc;r</em> (Valley of Fire), and also <em>W&acirc;di er-Rahib</em> (Valley of the Monks). Its whole length is some 20 miles in a straight line, and its descent nearly 4000 feet. Its bed east of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> is now about 40 feet higher than in ancient times. The Cedron is first mentioned in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> in connection with David's flight from <a href="../cathen/01058c.htm">Absalom</a>, during which he crossed it [<a href="../bible/2sa015.htm#vrs23">2 Samuel 15:23</a>]; and next, in connection with the prohibition to Semei against his ever crossing it [<a href="../bible/1ki002.htm#vrs37">1 Kings 2:37</a>]. It was at the torrent Cedron that King Asa burnt the filthy idol of his mother [<a href="../bible/1ki015.htm#vrs13">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch015.htm#vrs16">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>]. It was into it that Ezechias and Josias cast all the impurities which had polluted the House of the Lord (cf. <a href="../bible/2ch029.htm#vrs16">2 Chronicles 29:16</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch030.htm#vrs14">30:14</a>; <a href="../bible/2ki023.htm#vrs4">2 Kings 23:4, 6, 12</a>). The torrent Cedron is last mentioned in the O.T. in <a href="../bible/jer031.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>, apparently as part of the common cemetery of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> it is spoken of only once, in connection with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> going forth over it to Gethsemani (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs1">John 18:1</a>). In the present day it is the desired resting-place of both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, and the supposed scene of Last Judgment.
