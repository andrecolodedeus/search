<h1>Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08472c.htm">St. John of God</a>, the founder of this religious institution, was born 8 March, 1495, at Montemor Novo, in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. In his fortieth year he was drawn strongly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service and began a wonderful life of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, penance, and charity towards his neighbour. Pressed by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> suffering members, he founded his first <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he tenderly served the sick and afflicted. It is related in his life that one day the Lord appeared to him and told him that He was much pleased with his work, and for that reason He wished him to be called <a href="../cathen/08472c.htm">John of God</a>. After ten years spent in the exercise of heroic charity, he died 8 March, 1550. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Pope Alexander VIII</a> in 1690; and was declared heavenly patron of the dying and of all the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, in 1898.

<p>The charity of <a href="../cathen/08472c.htm">St. John of God</a> was destined to be perpetuated among his brethren, whom he had formed by his lessons and example. His first companion Antoni Martin was chosen to succeed him as superior of the order. Thanks to the generosity of King Philip II, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was founded at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, another at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, and several others in various Spanish towns. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> approved the Order of the Brothers <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> in 1572 under the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">rule of St. Augustine</a>. The order spread rapidly into the other countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and even into the distant colonies. In 1584 <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> called some of the Brothers to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and gave them the Hospital of St. John Calybita, which then became the mother-house of the whole order: Brother Pietro Soriano was appointed first superior. Brother Sebastiano Arias founded the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of Our Lady at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and the famous <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. At that time a holy servant of God and of the poor joined the brotherhood and shed great lustre upon the order by his burning charity and profound <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>: Blessed John Grande, who was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1852.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of the order in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was founded in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1601, by Queen Marie de' Medici. In the stormy days of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the Brothers were expelled from the forty <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> where they were caring for 4125 patients. But since then some large new <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> have been established. The order is governed by a prior general, who resides in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; it is now divided into eleven provinces, with 102 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 1536 Brothers, and 12,978 beds.

<p>In addition to these a hospice of the order has been established at Nazareth. In 1882 a home for demented patients (male) was founded at Stillorgan near <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The house at Scorton, near Darlington, Yorkshire, was founded in 1880 for the reception of male patients suffering from chronic infirmities, paralysis, or old age. It is supported by charitable contributions and payments for inmates. It is pleasantly situated in a very healthy country district.

<p>The Brothers undergo a special course of training in order to fit them for carrying out their various <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, to which they devote their life. In some provinces some of them are even graduates in medicine, surgery, and chemistry. The members are not in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> wishing to devote their sacred ministry to the Brothers and patients are received. After the example of their founder, they seek their own sanctification and their patients' spiritual and corporal welfare. To the three solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion they add a fourth, of serving the sick for life in their <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. They also perform the usual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exercises of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. They assist daily at Holy Mass, meditation, the recital in choir of the office of Our Lady, and spiritual reading. Young men of good disposition, sound health and possessing aptitude for the order, and resolved to serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> generously in the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> are received from the age of fifteen to thirty-five. The religious habit is usually given to <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> after three months. The time of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> is two years, after which the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> pronounces the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> which, although simple, are perpetual. Three years later, he can be admitted to solemn profession.
