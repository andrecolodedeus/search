<h1>Brothers of the Sacred Heart</h1>  

<p>A congregation founded in 1821 by P&egrave;re Andr&eacute; Coindre, of the <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Diocese of Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Its constitutions were modeled upon the constitutions of St. Ignatius based upon the Rule of Saint Augustine. Its members bind themselves for life by the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion. There are no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the congregation, the objective purpose of which is the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of boys in asylums, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> and select <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and commercial colleges. The growth of the congregation was slow. At the period of its origin the political condition of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was very unfavorable. It was a day of political agitation and revolution. Lyons, the cradle of the congregation, suffered sorely in these revolutions. But a more hampering difficulty to its growth lay in the ill-defined government imposed upon the congregation. P&egrave;re Andr&eacute; Coindre was the superior-general and continued such till his death in 1821. P&egrave;re Vincent Coindre, his brother, succeeded him in this office.

<p>In 1840 P&egrave;re Coindre assembled the general chapter of the congregation. During the discussions of the chapter, opinion among the brothers was unanimous that it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the success of the congregation that its temporal affairs should be in the hands of the brothers themselves, and that one of their number should be superior-general. The question was referred to Mgr de Bonald, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, who, after an exhaustive examination, judged it advisable that P&egrave;re Coindre should resign the office. On 13 Sept., 1841, Brother Polycarp was unanimously chosen by the brothers as their superior-general. He reconstructed the government of the community and gave it stability and permanency. At the time of his death in 1859, there were in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> alone seventy three establishments, an increase of sixty during his administration. He had, moreover, in 1846 opened up in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> at <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, Ala., a new field of labor for the institute. In 1872 the province of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> extended its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> into <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and in 1880 transferred its <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> from <a href="../cathen/07744a.htm">Indianapolis</a> to Arthabaskaville, P. Q., <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The growth of the congregation was here so rapid that it was deemed advisable to erect the establishments in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> into a separate province. This was effected by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the general chapter of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> held at Paradis, near <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1900. About the same time a house of studies for <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> and a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> province were established at Metuchen, N. J.

<p>The congregation has at the present time (1907) in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> forty-eight establishments directed by 460 brothers, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> more than 9000 pupils. Just previous to the French Law of 1901, suppressing <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, there were in that country alone 1100 brothers, 150 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, academies, colleges, asylums, deaf and dumb institutions, with 25,000 pupils, in twenty <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Owing to the present religious <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the congregation has been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to seek new fields of labor, and twenty establishments have recently been founded in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>.
