<h1>Brownsville</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariate Apostolic</a>, erected 1874. Previous to this date the entire <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">State of Texas</a> was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>. It was then divided into two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: Galveston, comprising all that part of the State north and north-west of the Colorado River; <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, comprising all the territory south of the Colorado River and north of the Nueces River, with the exception of Bee, San Patricio, Refugio, Goliad, and Aransas Counties and the Vicariate Apostolic of Brownsville comprising Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, Zapata, and Webb Counties, bordering on the Rio Grande; Encinal, Duval, and Nueces, situated north of these counties; the part of La Salle, McMullen, and Live Oak, south of the Nueces River, and finally San Patricio, Bee, Refugio, Goliad, and Aransas Counties, north of the Nueces River, a territory comprising 22,391 square miles.

<p>Its principal cities and towns are:

<ul> <li>Laredo (Texas side), with 12,000 inhabitants; <li>Brownsville, near the mouth of the Rio Grande, with 8,000; <li>Corpus Christi, on the Corpus Christi Bay, with 7,000; <li>San Diego, in Duval County, with 2,000; <li>Alice, in Nueces County, with 1,000; <li>Rockport, on Aransas Bay, with 1,000; <li>Goliad and Refugio with about the same population; <li>Beeville, in Bee County, with 2,000. </ul>

<p>There are other towns with less population, Skidmore in Bee County, Kingsville in Nueces County, Falfurrias, Benavides, Realitos, Hebbronville, <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, Hidalgo, Carrizo (or Zapata), Minas, Rio Grande City, each with a population of 1,500. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is estimated at 79,000, mostly Mexicans; there are about 3,000 English-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The total population is about 110,000.

<p>This southern part of <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> was inhabited by <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> less than sixty years ago. Corpus Christi had for its first settler Capt. Kenny, who had a store several times visited by hostile Indians. Brownsville owes its beginning to Major Brown, who came there at the time of the Mexican War. The church there was begun in 1852. San Patricio and Refugio were settled by <a href="../cathen/08132b.htm">Irish colonists</a> under the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexican</a> Government. La Bahia is the most ancient settlement; it was built by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> to oppose the encroachments of the French under <a href="../cathen/09009b.htm">La Salle</a>. After La Bahia the oldest place is Laredo, built at the end of the eighteenth century. In 1866 there was not a fence nor a railroad to be seen from <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a> to Brownsville; now the whole country is fenced in, and there are six railroad lines in operation.

<p>The Oblate Fathers, whose missions extend from San Ignacio to the mouth of the Rio Grande, located in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> in 1852, their first superior being Father Verdet. Within a week he was drowned in the Gulf on his way from Brownsville to <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>. The mission of Rio Grande City was begun in 1872, the one at Roma in 1864, the San Diego mission in 1866. Laredo was in charge of <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexican</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> until Father Girandon came in 1855. San Patricio was under the care of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Father O'Reilly built in 1856 the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church of Corpus Christi. Brownsville, Laredo, Corpus Christi, Refugio, and Beeville have large and well decorated churches. There are twelve churches with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>: Brownsville, Rio Grande City, Roma, Laredo, San Diego, Corpus Christi, Rockport, Goliad, Refugio, Beeville, and San Patricio. There are also forty <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> where regular monthly services are held. The vicariate has two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, one in Laredo under the care of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, and a new one in Corpus Christi, under the care of the <a href="../cathen/07705a.htm">Sisters of the Incarnate Word</a>, of <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>.

<p>There are four academies, namely, Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Laredo, and Rio Grande City, with about 60 boarders in all, and about 200 scholars. Besides, there are nine <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with about 500 pupils, under the care of 52 teaching sisters, assisted by 20 lay sisters. There are, in addition to these, 12 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> sisters, and 6 engaged in teaching non-Catholic public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. There is but one college (in Brownsville, under the care of the Oblate Fathers), with about 100 pupils.

<p>The Reverend Dominic Manucy, then <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Peter's church, Montgomery, <a href="../cathen/01240a.htm">Alabama</a>, was appointed first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Brownsville, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dulma, 8 December, 1878. He was born 20 December, 1823, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, at <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, 15 August, 1850. He took possession at Brownsville, 11 February, 1875, and remained there until he was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Diocese of Mobile</a> upon the death of Bishop Quinlan, 9 March, 1883. He resigned the <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">See of Mobile</a> the following year and was reappointed to Brownsville, with the <a href="../cathen/09683b.htm">Titular See of Maronia</a>. He died at <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, 4 December, 1885. Bishop Neraz of <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, was then appointed administrator of Brownsville, and directed its affairs until 1890, when the Rev. Pedro Verdaguer, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the church of Our Lady of Angels, <a href="../cathen/10532a.htm">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, was appointed to Brownsville by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 3 July. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 9 November, 1890, at <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona, Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aulon, and was <a href="../cathen/08050a.htm">installed</a> at Brownsville, 21 May, 1891. He was born 10 December, 1835, at San Pedro de Torello, Cataluna, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 12 December, 1862, at <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, U.S.A.
