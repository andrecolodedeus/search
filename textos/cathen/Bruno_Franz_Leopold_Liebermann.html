<h1>Bruno Franz Leopold Liebermann</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b., at Molsheim in Alsace 12 Oct., 1759; 4. at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 11 Nov., 1844. Having finished his humanities in the college at Molsheim, he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> from 1776 to 1780 in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, after which, as he was too young for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, he was as <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> appointed teacher in the college at Molsheim. He became a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and a licentiate of theology in 1782, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 14 June, 1783 lie shortly afterwards became professor in the Strasburg <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, in 1784 preacher at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and in 1787 <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Ernolsheim near Molsheim. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take refuge across the Rhine (1792), and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, Cardinal Rohan, appointed him <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> which had been transferred for the time to the Abbey of All <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in the Black Forest. Here he taught <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> and canon law, and wrote his unpublished "Institutiones iuris canonici universalis." In 1795 he secretly returned to his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> at Ernolsheim, where he laboured in secret and in great Ianger for the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> until 1801, holding at the same time the office of extraordinary episcopal commissary for this division of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1801 he was called to Strasburg as preacher at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and secretary of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but returned once more to Ernolsheim in 1802. On 12 March, 1804 he was there unexpectedly arrested, and, on the groundless suspicion that he was in secret communication with the royal family, was held a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for eight months. When, through the intercession of Bishop Colmar of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> with <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, he regained his freedom he was called by this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1805 as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the newly founded <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> there and in 1806 became also a member of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. In the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> he lectured on canon law, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, pastoral theology, and, after 1812, also on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>.

<p>Personally and through the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> trained by him, Liebermann exerted a wholesome and long-continued influence upon the revival of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> spirit in <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and the adjoining <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Among his pupils were the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> R&auml;ss, <a href="../cathen/15577a.htm">Weis</a>, Geissel, and such other distinguished men as <a href="../cathen/08666a.htm">Klee</a>, L&uuml;ft, <a href="../cathen/09150b.htm">Lennig</a>, Remling, and Nickel. After he had declined in 1823 the appointment to the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">See of Metz</a>, Bishop Tharin summoned him as his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, where he continued his fruitful activity. Under Tharin's successor, Bishop Lepappe de Trevern, he withdrew more from public life. His last years were spent in retirement in the mother-house of the Sisters of Charity. Liebermann's name will live in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> literature through his well-known "Institutiones theologic&aelig;", first published in five volumes (Mainz, 1819-27; 6th ed., 1844) and later in two (10th ed., Mainz, 1870). Owing to the correctness of its contents and its clear and well-ordered style, this work was used as a textbook for years in many <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and America. During the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, Liehermann published several anonymous pamphlets in defence of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and against the required <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of the civil constitution of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> several have been published separately, e.g. "Lob- und Trauerrede bei Gelegenheit des Hintrittes des hochw&uuml;rdigsten Herrn Joseph Ludwig Colmar, Bischof zu Mainz" (Mainz, 1818). After his death appeared:&mdash; "Liebermann's Predigten, herausgegeben von Freunden und Verehrern des Verewigten" (3 vols., Mainz, 1851-3). From 1825 to 1826 he was editor of the "Katholik".
