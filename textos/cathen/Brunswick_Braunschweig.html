<h1>Brunswick (Braunschweig)</h1>  

<p>A duchy situated in the mountainous central part of Northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, comprising the region of the Harz mountains. Territorially, the duchy is not a unit, but parcelled into three large, and six smaller, sections. Both in extent of territory and in population it ranks tenth among the confederated states of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The inhabitants are of the Lower Saxon race. The census of 1900 enumerated 464,333 inhabitants. Of these 432,570 were <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, 4406 Reformed, 24,175 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and 1824 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The Government is a constitutional monarchy, hereditary in the male line of the House of Brunswick-Luneberg. The elder line having become extinct in 1884 by the death of Duke Wilhelm, the younger line, represented by the Duke of Cumberland, should have succeeded to the throne. For political reasons, however, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> objected to his taking possession, and by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Bundesrat he was excluded. The present regent, chosen by the legislature, is Duke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenberg. Agriculture, industries, and commerce are highly developed in the duchy. It is stated that the first potatoes raised in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> were planted in Brunswick from five of the tubers brought to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by Francis Drake. The town Brunswick (<em>Brunonis vicus</em>, Bruno's village), which has given its name to the duchy, was founded in the second half of the ninth century. The country was part of the allodial lands of Henry the Lion. After his defeat and exile in 1180, he lost all his possessions. Brunswick, however, was restored to his grandson Otto, who was made first Duke of Brunswick by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. In the fourteenth century the town became a centre of the Hanseatic League, as well as of the confederation of the Lower Saxon towns.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> dates from <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> conquest of the Saxon country of which Brunswick is a part. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> found and destroyed an ancient German idol in the place where now Brunswick stands. At Kissenbruck many of the conquered Saxons were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the country was partly under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Diocese of Halberstadt, partly under that of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. At the end of the eighth and the beginning of the ninth century <a href="../cathen/09415a.htm">St. Ludger</a> laboured in the neighbourhood of Helmstedt, where he founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Duke of Eastphalia and his devout wife founded, in 852, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Brunshausen, near Gandersheim, for <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, where his daughter Hathumod was first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>. It was her brother Bruno who some years later founded the town of Brunswick. When, in 881, the church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Gandersheim were completed, the community was transferred thither, under the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> Gerberga, sister of Hathumod. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> reached its highest point of prosperity in the tenth century, as is shown by the life of <a href="../cathen/07504b.htm">Hrotswitha</a>, the celebrated "nun of Gandersheim", who sang the praises of Otto the Great and wrote Latin comedies after the manner of Terence. Other <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> founded in the eleventh and twelfth centuries were Steterburg, Lutter, and Clus. The great <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a> also flourished in Brunswick. The three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Amelungsborn, Marienthal, and Riddaghausen were founded in the twelfth century. The Augustinians also had a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for men and one for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> at Helmstedt.

<p>In the town of Brunswick religion flourished from an early period. Among the older <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> should be mentioned St. Blasius and St. Cyriacus, also the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> built in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Autor, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were brought from <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and who became the <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the town. In the twelfth century Henry the Lion did much for his town of Brunswick. He rebuilt some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and erected several churches. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> made a foundation in the town in the thirteenth, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, early in the fourteenth, century. The town also possessed several <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguinages</a>. Mention must here be made of the great reform of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which was wrought in North <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the fifteenth century. The celebrated reformer of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, Johannes Busch, canon regular of Windesheim, extended his beneficent labours to Brunswick. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation of Bursfeld, which at the end of the fifteenth century counted 142 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, may be said to have sprung from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Clus near Gandersheim. (See Bursfeld.)

<p>With regard to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">religious revolution</a> of the sixteenth century it will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to consider the town of Brunswick separately. It was a proud and rich town and had long sought to make itself independent of the authority of its dukes. Hence the revolutionary doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> were readily accepted by the townsmen. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> was introduced as early as 1521, and firmly established by Burgenhagen in 1528, not without ruthless fanaticism. In the country, however, Duke Henry's authority prevailed, and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> gained no foothold until 1542, when, owing to the victory of the Smalkaldic League, the duke fell into captivity, Bugenhagen was recalled, and the external observance of the new religion was forced upon the people with much <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and cruelty. When Henry recovered his duchy, in 1547, he re-established the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. His son and successor made the whole district <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, and it has since remained a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> stronghold. Duke Julius did not destroy all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but allowed many of them to persist as so-called <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. Among these was the once celebrated Gandersheim which was only suppressed during the general spoliation and secularization of 1802. Prominent among the Dukes of Brunswick in post-Reformation times is Anton Ulrich, said to have been the most learned prince of his time, a patron of the arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, himself a poet, and a student of the early Fathers. He took a lively interest in the movement for the reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the same movement with which Leibniz was identified. Early in 1710 the duke <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and a few months later published his "Fifty Reasons Why the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is Preferable to Protestantism". (See R&auml;ss, Convertiten, IX.) Two of his daughters followed him into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The only result of his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> so far as the duchy was concerned was his erection of two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches, one in Brunswick, the other in Wolfenbuttel, to which according to his desire <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were appointed.

<p><a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> placed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Duchy of Brunswick under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. They are merely tolerated in the duchy. The Constitution of 1832, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, granted liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of public worship, but subjected all churches to the "supervision of the Government", that is to say, of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran church</a> authorities. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1848 brought little relief to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. No <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ordinance or pontifical constitution may be published without the government's <em>placet</em>; all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregations were incorporated in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The last intolerable law was abolished in 1867 for three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, henceforth recognized as such by the State, viz., Brunswick, Wolfenbuttel, and Helmstedt, all the others remaining parts of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (with the three aforesaid exceptions) may not perform <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, or hold funeral services without giving previous notice to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and obtaining his leave. And no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, unless duly recognized by the State, may perform any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> function without falling under the penalty of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Non-recognized <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are even fined for conferring <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the case of necessity, and for administering the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The same intolerance prevails with regard to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>. The State contributes nothing towards the support of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship. In the year 1864 a law was passed abolishing <em>Stolgeb&uuml;hren</em>, i.e., all perquisites and fees received by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions, such as marriages and funerals, which had previously to be handed over to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The general statement, therefore, in the "Kirchenlexicon", that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1867 has rendered the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the Duchy of Brunswick "wholly satisfactory", needs recension; it must be restricted to the three above-named <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; in the rest of the duchy the condition of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is far from satisfactory. It is for this reason that the <a href="../cathen/16020b.htm">Centre Party</a> in the Reichstag has brought in the Toleration Bill, which, if carried, would sweep away all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> disabilities throughout the empire, in Brunswick as well as in <a href="../cathen/10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a>, and in the Kingdom of Saxony.
