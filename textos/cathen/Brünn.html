<h1>Br&uuml;nn</h1>  

<p>Suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of the Archdiocese of Olmutz, embracing the south-western part of <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, an area of 3825 sq. m., and containing, according to the "Catalogus cleri Dioceseos Brunensis 1907", about 1,051,654 inhabitants, 1,000,607 of whom are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>The erection of the Diocese of Br&uuml;nn was due to <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Empress Maria Theresa</a>. The territory comprised in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> belonged from a very early period to the Diocese of Olmutz. To obviate the difficulties arising from the administration of such a vast territory, <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> in 1773 entered into negotiations with <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Pope Clement XIV</a>. Olmutz was to be raised to the rank of an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> and two newly created <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> &mdash; Br&uuml;nn and Troppau &mdash; assigned it as suffragans. Eventually, however, only one was created. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 5 December, 1777, Olmutz was made an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> and Br&uuml;nn erected into an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. The collegiate chapter of the provostship of Sts. Peter and Paul which had been in existence in Br&uuml;nn since 1296 was constituted the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and the provost-church was made the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Matthias Franz, Count von Chorinsky, mitred <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the chapter was appointed by the empress first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He was succeeded by Johann Baptist Lachenbauer (1787-99), Vincenz Joseph von Schrattenbach (1800-16), Wenzel Urban Ritter von Stuffler (1817-31), Franz Anton von Gindl (1832-41), Anton Ernst, Count von Schaffgotsche (1842-70), Karl N&ouml;ttig (1871-82), Franz Sales Bauer (1882-1904), since 1904 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Olmutz, and Paulus, Count von Huyn, b. at Br&uuml;nn, 1868, appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> 17 April, 1904, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 26 June, 1904.
