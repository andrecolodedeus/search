<h1>Buckfast Abbey</h1>  

<p>The date of the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Our Lady of Buckfast, two miles from Ashburton, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in a beautiful Devonshire valley watered by the Dart, is unknown; but it was certainly long before the Norman Conquest. The earliest authentic document is a grant by King Canute (1015-1035), to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Buckfast of the manor of Sele, now called Zeal Monachorum. The best authorities assign the foundation to the middle of the tenth century. Early in the twelfth century it was incorporated into the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation of Savigny, founded in Normandy in 1112. In 1148, five years before the death of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, the thirty Savigny houses, including Buckfast (of which Eustace was then <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>) were affiliated to Clairvaux, thus becoming a part of the great <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a>. Buckfast now developed into one of the most important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the great <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Diocese of Exeter</a>. It flourished both materially and spiritually originating the celebrated woollen trade of the district encouraging other industries, and preserving unimpaired its discipline and the fervour of its observance. The latter, however, became relaxed (as in other <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> houses) in the fourteenth century, one result being the rapid diminution in the community. The reputation, however, of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> for learning was sustained until the dissolution, and they seem to have been generally beloved in the district for their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, kindliness, and benevolence.

<p>The last legitimately elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Buckfast was John Rede, who died about 1535, the year of the Visitation ordered by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, which resulted in the intrusion of Gabriel Donne into the vacant chair. Donne surrendered the house to the King in 1538, receiving for himself ample compensation. The buildings were immediately sold, the lead stripped from the roof, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and church left to decay. In 1882, about three centuries and a half after the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey, the ruined building came again into the possession of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, belonging to the French province of the Cassinese Congregation of the Primitive Observance. Mass was again said and the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> chanted at Buckfast on 29 October, 1882, and eight months later the Abbey was legally conveyed to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.

<p>The plan of the buildings at Buckfast followed the conventional <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> arrangement, with the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> south of the church, and grouped round it the <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>, calefactory, refectory, and other <em>loca regularia</em>. The church was 220 feet long, with short transcripts, each with a small eastern <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> now in possession have built a temporary church, and are proceeding with the work of rebuilding the former one, and the rest of the monastic buildings, on the ancient foundations. The tower which still remains was been carefully restored, and the southern wing of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> has been rebuilt in simple twelfth-century style, and was opened in April, 1886. The third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> since the return of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in 1882, Dom Anscher Vouier, formerly one of the professors at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> University of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> blessed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12171b.htm">Plymouth</a> in October, 1906.
