<h1>Budweis</h1>  

<p>(Czech, BUDEJOVICE; <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> BUDOVICIUM; BOHEMO-BUDVICENSIS).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> situated in Southern <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Archdiocese of Prague</a>. Although projected since 1630, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was not erected until the reign of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> of 20 September, 1785. By the provisions of this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, the civil districts of Budweis, Tabor, Prachatitz, and Klattau were separated from the <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Archdiocese of Prague</a> and erected into the new Diocese of Budweis, thus giving it an area of 5600 sq. miles with a population of 660,000. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nicholas at Budweis was made <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> contributed 3300 Rhenish marks (present value 10,080 kronen or $2,016) towards its endowment.

<p>The following <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have occupied the See of Budweis: (1) Johann Prokop, Count von Schaffgotsche (1785-1813), formerly <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <em>Generalseminar</em> at <a href="../cathen/03011c.htm">Br&uuml;nn</a>, and canon at <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>; (2) Ernst Konstantin Ruzicka (1815-45); (3) Joseph Andreas Lindauer (1845-50); (4) Johann Valerian Jirsik (1851-83), especially noteworthy for the part he took in the development of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; (5) Franz, Count Sch&ouml;nborn (1883-85), later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, d. 1899; (6) Martin Joseph Riha (7 July, 1885-6 February, 1907), the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> ecclesiastic to be appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Budweis. The present administrator (1907) is the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">Vicar Capitular</a>, J. Hulka. In conformity with the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the provincial council of Prague (1860) three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> have been held (1870, 1872, 1875).
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>According to the organization of 1857 the Diocese of Budweis is divided into the Vicariate-General of Budweis on which depend the archdeaconry of Krummau, the provostship of Neuhaus, and 8 <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archipresbyterates</a>: Budweis, Klattau, Krummau, Neuhaus, Taus, and Winterberg, with 4 vicariates each, and Strakonitz and Tabor with 5 vicariates each, making a total of 34 vicariates. Among the 432 <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> divisions for the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>, there are two archdeaconries, 57 deaneries, 366 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 5 expositures, and 1 administrature, with a total population (1907) of 1,123,113. This number is divided as follows: 1,106,729 <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholics</a> (an average of 98.1 per cent, in many vicariates 99.92 percent of the whole population); 1589 members of the Augsburg Evangelical Church; 2302 members of the Helvetic Evangelical Church; 12,447 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and 46 of no religious persuasion. The population of 282 of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> divisions (68.9 per cent), 761,568 is almost entirely Czech; that of 110 (15.34 per cent), 181,790, purely German; that of 25 (10.66 per cent), 119,830, predominantly Czech; and of 15 (5.1 per cent), 59,925, prevailingly German. The average population of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> is 2000, the population of the largest, Budweis, being 45,528, and of the smallest, Korkushatten, 414.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> actively engaged in the ministry number 849 secular and 136 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The latter are thus divided: 59 <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> from Hohenfurth, with 4 professed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; 18 Brothers of the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar, a congregation founded at Budweis in 1888, with 5 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 18 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, and 11 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>; 11 <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>; 11 Knights of Malta; 3 <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>; 4 Reformed <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, with 5 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; 3 Calced and 4 Discalced Augustinians, with 4 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; 6 <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, with 4 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; 6 <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> with 4 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; 4 <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, with 4 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; 3 <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>. Twenty-nine <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are attended by members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; 2 are granted by free collation, i.e. bestowed by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>; and the rest are subject to patronage, 88 to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> patronage. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, a dean, who is also the urban dean of Budweis, a cantor, and 3 capitular canons to which are added 4 honorary canons; the consistory has 9 members. Young men are trained for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Budweis, which provides for those speaking the different languages found in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; it has 6 professors and 103 students, 3 in the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There is also in Budweis an episcopal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys (<em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em>) without a special gymnasium attached (founded 1853).
<h2>Female religious orders, shrines, churches, etc.</h2>

<p>In the diocese there are 7 orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with 362 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 90 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and lay sisters, and 40 houses; 216 Poor School Sisters of Notre Dame (since 1849); 129 <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo</a> (1842); 93 Sisters of the Most <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> of the Altar (founded at Budweis in 1887); 2 Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>; 3 <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>; 3 <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>; and 2 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. The great mass of the people are engaged in agricultural pursuits and are in general religiously inclined. Popular missions (<em>Volksmissionen</em>) are frequent, 450 of them being held between 1850 and 1897 in 228 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 334 by <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> and 112 by <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The chief confraternities are: the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Confraternity of the Rosary</a>, in 230 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 30,000 members; the Confraternity for the Adoration of the Most <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and the Adornment of Poor Churches, founded in 1859, in 238 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, which has 15,000 members and disburses yearly 5,000 kronen ($1,000); the Confraternity of St. Michael in 265 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 5,000 members, who contribute annually 4,000 kronen ($800) toward <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's-pence</a>.

<p>The principal places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: Br&uuml;nn, founded in 1715, visited yearly by 300 processions; Rimau, built at the end of the seventeenth century, with 100 annual processions; Gojau mentioned as early as 1469; and Kremeschnik, built in 1632. Here, as in the rest of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> edifices of earlier centuries were greatly damaged during the religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the fifteenth to the seventeenth century. The prevailing <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> style is baroque. Mention should be made of the Romanesque church of Muhlhausen, built between 1184 and 1250, formerly a <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> church; the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> abbey-churches of Goldenkron (1263-1300), and Hohenfurth (1259-1350), built in <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style; the two-naved church of St. &AElig;gidius in Muhlhausen, originally Romanesque (in the twelfth century), in 1407 rebuilt in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Budweis (1642-49) and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church at Prestitz (1748-73) are examples of the <a href="../cathen/02303b.htm">baroque style</a>, the latter designed by Kilian Dienzenhofer. Popular <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations are not at present very numerous. There are but two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly papers in the diocese. It is only within recent years that any serious attempts have been made to organize the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, both on political and non-partisan lines. These efforts have so far met with scant success; in the past, therefore, the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has been represented in the Austrian Parliament by Liberal deputies.
