<h1>Buffalo</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> established 23 April, 1847, now comprises the counties of Erie, Niagara, Genesee, Orleans, Chautauqua, Wyoming, Cattaraugus, and Allegany, in the State of New York, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> an area of 6,357 square miles. It was set apart from the great Diocese of New York and the see located at Buffalo on Lake Erie, the territory comprising nearly one-third of the State of New York. In 1868 the <a href="../cathen/13102a.htm">Diocese of Rochester</a> was formed from the eastern counties of this territory; and in 1896, after Bishop Ryan's death, four more counties, Steuben, Schuyler, Chemung, and Tioga, were taken from the Diocese of Buffalo and added to the Rochester <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.
<h2>Indian missions</h2>

<p>Two of the nations of the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> League, the Senecas and the Cayugas, dwelt in this region before the advent of the white men. The Senecas had villages in the valley of the Genesee about twenty miles from Lake Ontario, and the Cayugas erected their cabins near the lake which still bears their name. The Seneca was the most populous and warlike nation of the League. In their frequent raids into the country of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> of Northern <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, they carried off many captives who had been instructed in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by the French missionaries from Quebec. So numerous were these <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> captives that they formed an entire village, which was called St. Michael's, in memory of their old <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> home. <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries visited these towns in 1656, and cheered the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> captives who had lost all hope of ever again beholding a "Black Robe". In 1669 this village was located in the north-east part of the present town of East Bloomfield. The <a href="../cathen/06271a.htm">Rev. Father Fremin</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, established his residence in this town in the fall of 1668, built a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and said the first Mass there, 3 November, 1668. Three years later the Rev. James Pierron became the resident missionary at Gannagaro, or St. James, a Seneca town situated on Boughton Hill, south of the present village of Victor. The principal village of the Cayugas was situated about three and one-half miles south of <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">Union</a> Springs, near Great Gully Brook. This was called St. Joseph's by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. <a href="../cathen/03347a.htm">Father Carheil</a> built a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> there in November, 1668, and immediately began his work of instructing. There was another town of the Cayugas at the northern extremity of Seneca Lake. Another <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built in the large Seneca town of Gandachioragon, or Totiakton, which was called the Immaculate Conception by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. This was situated near <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, about ten miles west of St. James.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had four or five prosperous missions within the territory of the original Diocese of Buffalo, in which they laboured successfully for ten years until English intrigue and subsequent <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the French forced them from the field. During those years they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> nearly all the dying; they imparted a general <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to the two western nations of the League; they strengthened the old <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and added several hundred <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> converts to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Many of the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> chiefs sided with the English, in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the latter against the French, and the French missionaries were forced from the field of their labours. Many of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indians had already abandoned their homes in the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> country for the new settlements on the St. Lawrence, under the protection of the French; and many more accompanied the Fathers in their flight, and settled on the St. Regis, or at <a href="../cathen/03458a.htm">Caughnawaga</a>, where they still practise the Faith they acquired in their <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> homes. In the summer of 1669 the explorer, La Salle, with two <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> and a party of twenty-five men, started to explore the region of the Great Lakes in search of a north-west passage to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. They skirted along the southern shore of Lake Ontario, crossing the mouth of Niagara River, until they reached Burlington Bay, where the party disbanded. La Salle went again in 1678, with <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Father Hennepin</a>, in a large vessel which entered the Niagara River on 6th December, to the strains of the <em>Te Deum</em>. The next day a party with <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Father Hennepin</a> ascended the river in a canoe, and landed on the northern shore, near the present suspension bridge on the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> side. On 11 December, 1678, they landed on the other side of the river where <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Father Hennepin</a> said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. This was probably the first Mass celebrated within the present limits of the Diocese of Buffalo. A little fort was built there as a protection against Indian assault. Then they proceeded up the river, about five miles about the Falls, where the "Griffon" was built. <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Father Hennepin</a> remained there all winter, holding service for the men in a little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> until the vessel was towed up the river to the present harbour of Black Rock, where it anchored until it was in readiness to sail as the first vessel on the lakes.
<h2>Catholic settlers</h2>

<p>After <a href="../cathen/04732a.htm">Denonville</a> had destroyed the Seneca towns in 1687, he sent a detachment of his army to establish a fort at the mouth of the Niagara River. A garrison of one hundred men was left there with a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. Many died the following winter, and the fort was abandoned. It was reoccupied in 1726, and from that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> regular services were held in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> until 1759, when the fort capitulated to the English. Soon after the Revolutionary War the Government began building military roads, and the State legislature made appropriations for building highways, and these offered intending settlers better facilities for proceeding farther inland. There was a highway through the State before 1820, reaching to Lake Erie. Buffalo and Erie County offered advantages to intending settlers, and about 1820 many Alsatians located in the vicinity. Many of these were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but they had no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and they could only keep alive the religious spirit by <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> devotions. The Rev. Patrick Kelly, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by <a href="../cathen/04257a.htm">Bishop Connolly</a> of New York in 1821, was sent to minister to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the western part of the State. He visited Buffalo the same year, and held one public service in a little frame building on Pearl Street. The <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Rev. Stephen Badin</a> was the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to remain any length of time in Buffalo. His field of labour was Kentucky, but sickness compelled him to seek rest. He visited Buffalo for six weeks as the guest of Louis Le Couteulx, who then lived at the corner of Main and Exchange Streets. Here he said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the town; and he urged them to organize and form a congregation. Mr. Le Couteulx started the good work by donating a site for church, cemetery, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> residence, at the corner of Main and Edward Streets. The deed was sent to Bishop Dubois as a New Year's gift in January, 1829. Bishop Dubois visited Buffalo the same year and concluded that the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the vicinity required the attention of a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, so the Rev. John Nicholas Mertz was sent as the first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Buffalo. On this occasion Bishop Dubois sang a solemn high Mass in the court-house; and in the afternoon a procession composed of different nationalities marched from the court-house to the site for the new church where the ground was blessed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. father Mertz rented a little frame building on Pearl Street, back of the old Eagle tavern; and here he held services until the "Lamb of God", a rough timber church, was erected on the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> at Main and Edward Streets. The corner stone of this first church of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was laid 8 July, 1831, but the church was not opened for services until the following year. In the next five years congregations were formed at Lancaster, Williamsville, Nor Bush, East Eden, and Lockport. Father Mertz, with his assistant, the Rev. Alexander Pax, looked after the spiritual interests of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the first four places, and the Rev. Bernard O'Reilly of Rochester attended the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Lockport.



<p>Buffalo grew quickly after becoming a city. The church on Main Street was too small for the rapidly increasing numbers. The English-speaking members withdrew from the church in 1837 and formed a separate congregation, renting the second floor of a building at the corner of Main Street and the Terrace; where the Rev. Charles Smith said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> for them once a month. Father Smith was employed on the other <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> at Java, or in looking after the spiritual well-being of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> employed in the construction of the Genesee Valley Canal. Soon afterwards <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was bought at the corner of Ellicott and Batavia Streets, for a church for the English-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the city. The Rev. John N. Neumann, who was afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia, and who has been proposed for <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> went to Buffalo in July, 1836, and laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for four years in the missions of the Erie County and vicinity. The missionary then had few of the comforts and conveniences of the present day and Father Neumann was often compelled to tramp many miles over rough roads, or through the forest, carrying his vestments on his back, to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> or to administer to the sick. The Rev. Bernard O'Reilly of Rochester, who was afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, also did effective work among those engaged in building the Erie Canal and in constructing the locks at Lockport. The Rev. Thomas McEvoy of Java attended to the spiritual wants of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of three or four counties. He resided at Java, and from this place he frequently visited clusters of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Allegany, <a href="../cathen/15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>, Steuben, and Chautauqua counties. Among the lay people Louis Le Couteulx was the greatest benefactor of the incipient church in Buffalo. He located at Buffalo in 1803, and it was at his house, corner of Main and Exchange Streets, that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were first assembled and were urged to form a congregation. Besides donating the site for the first church, he also gave the land for the Deaf Mute Institute, the Infant Asylum, the Immaculate Conception church, and the Buffalo Orphan asylum. Other lay people of that period and later prominent in church work were: Patrick Milton, Maurice Vaughn, Patrick Cannon, John Connolly, Mrs. O'Rourke, Mrs. Rowen, Mrs. Kimmit, and Messrs. Ambrose, Feldman, Fisher, Steffan, Dingens, Lautz, Paul, Diebold, Gittere, Pfohl, Wechter, Doll, Smith, Miller, Hager, Guinther, Vogt, Davis, John Straus, Gerhard Lang, and their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>.

<p>The Very Rev. John Timon, a Visitor General of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a> (Vincentians) was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Buffalo in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in New York, 17 October, 1847, by Bishop Hughes. The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appointed the Rev. Bernard O'Reilly, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Patrick's church, Rochester, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and began a retreat for his priests; then he gave missions for his people in the sixteen churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Many of these were plain frame structures, without <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> ornament, and many of them had no altar except a table or some rough timber fitted up for the purpose. In many cases services were held in rented buildings, especially where public works attracted large numbers of men but gave no promise of permanent settlement. Such was the case along the Erie Canal and the Genesee Valley Canal, where services were held in the largest workmen's shanty, or in the nearest town hall. Men engaged in these public works were attracted by the fertility of the soil or the advantages of localities, and sent for their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> and friends, and established homes in the western part of the State along the lines of public traffic. Thus little <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlements were formed, and incipient congregations were organized. The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregations were made up of settlers from the East or immigrants from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.
<h2>Scarcity of priests</h2>

<p>The growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, before the advent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the western part of the State, was entirely from immigration. Many were lost to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during this period because they had settled in remote localities, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were scarce. Nearly all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who laboured in Western New York during this period were from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and some were not permanently attached to the diocese. The small number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> could not visit regularly the many small settlements in that extensive territory, and many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> would not see a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for months, or even years. Under such conditions it was but natural that some should fall away. Before there was a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Buffalo people journeyed all the way to Albany to have their children <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, others took their children to Monroe, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, where there was a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. When young people decided to get married, two or three of the respectable old people of the community were called in as witnesses; troth was plighted, and the couple became man and wife, with the understanding that as soon as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> came the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would be invoked upon the marriage. A journey to Albany in those days was a difficult undertaking. It meant many days travel through the forest, on horseback, by stage-coach, or rough wagons. When the Erie Canal was built, part of the journey could be made by packet boat; but as a rule people postponed the reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> until some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> went through this region on his way to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlements of the West, or in transit between the East and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> or Quebec. Priests were scarce for some years after Buffalo was made a diocese; and one of Bishop Timon's first labours was directed to the establishment of colleges and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth. He induced the Oblates, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to send communities to found colleges, and to assist in the formation of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The Oblate Fathers in August, 1851, started a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and college in a brick building, which was located on the site of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> rectory. This institution was later transferred to Prospect Hill, on the site of the present Holy Angels <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in 1855 located at Ellicottville, but shortly after moved to Allegany. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> started the present St. Michael's Church and Canisius College (1851). After the advent of Bishop Timon fallen-away <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> began to return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and many non-Catholics embraced the Faith. His missions and his lectures in all the towns of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> awakened an interest in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> and practice; and from three to five hundred new members were added to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> each year through the conversion of non-Catholics. Much of the prejudice also, which existed in some localities, was dispelled by the diffusion of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2>Bishops of the see</h2>

<p>(1) Bishop Timon died 16 April, 1867. He was born 12 February, 1797, at Conewago, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, in June, 1825. For a long time he was a missionary in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> and in April, 1840, was named <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> there but refused the office.

<p>(2) The Very Rev. Stephen Vincent Ryan who, like his predecessor, was a Visitor General of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a>, was appointed to succeed him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Buffalo and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 8 November, 1868. Bishop Ryan was born 1 January, 1825, at Almonte, <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and learning, he continued the great work of Bishop Timon. He died 10 April, 1896.

<p>(3) The Rev. James E. Quigley, D.D., his successor, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 24 February, 1897. Bishop Quigley's condemnation of the attempt of the Socialists to identify their doctrines with the principles of labour unionism, and thus wean men from their allegiance to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, gained for him a national reputation. He was promoted to the vacant <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, 19 February, 1903.

<p>(4) The Rev. Charles H. Colton of New York, was next appointed to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, 24 August, 1903.
