<h1>Bukarest</h1>  

<p>(B<font size=-2>UCHAREST</font>; B<font size=-2>UCARESTIENSIS</font>; Rumanian, B<font size=-2>UCHARESCI</font> "City of enjoyment")

<p>Comprises the Kingdom of Rumania, of which Bukarest is the capital, excluding Moldavia, and contains, according to the archdiocesan year-book for 1907, about 56,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, 4,000 to 5,000 <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Rumanians, chiefly immigrants from <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, Banat, and Bukowina, and a few hundred <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. In the city of Bukarest which in 1905 had 285,445 inhabitants there are about 202,000 Orthodox Greeks and 43,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The city is situated in a swampy plain on both sides of the Dimbobitza which is here crossed by about a dozen bridges. It is noted for many stately edifices, and the semi-Oriental appearance of its older quarters is heightened by the numerous gardens and the bright domes of its Greek churches. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists at present of 4 canons, 1 honorary canon, and 4 honorary canons outside the diocese. There are in the archdiocese 40 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (in addition to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>), including 2 <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, and 1 <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>; 24 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, one of the Greek-Rumanian Rite; 45 churches including 23 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches. The training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is provided for in the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Bukarest, which has four professors and nineteen seminarists; six seminarists are being trained outside the diocese. The opposition of the <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumanian</a> Government has hitherto rendered the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college impossible. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> exist in all <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. In the city of Bukarest are twenty-six <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> who conduct three <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with an attendance of 1,028. The English Ladies, numbering about 252, have two houses in Bukarest, one each in Bra&iuml;la, Craiova, and Turnu Severin, and conduct five boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 705 pupils, eight primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls with an attendance of 1,493, and one <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> with 20 children. The Dames de Sion have one foundation in Bukarest, with thirty-seven sisters and conduct a boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with an attendance of 133; the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> one foundation with four sisters. The Hungarians have established nine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (two in Bukarest), attended by about 945 children. In addition to the above-mentioned orders, the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> have one house with four members. The most important churches are: the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, a three-naved Gothic edifice, the largest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in the country, which was completed in 1884; and the Baratsia, an early church of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, destroyed by fire in 1848 and since rebuilt.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>For the history of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the territory now comprised within the Archdiocese of Bukarest see <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">RUMANIA</a>. The present archdiocese was erected by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, 27 April, 1883. Bukarest, however, had previously been the residence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, viz., the Bishops of Nicopolis, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, who were also Administrators Apostolic of Wallachia, and had resided at Rustchuk. Bishop Paulus Davanlia (1777-1804) left Rustchuk and lived at the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Bukarest (1792-93), where he also died. His successor, Franciscus Ferreri transferred his residence to Cioplea, a village near Bukarest founded in 1812 by <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> refugees, but he was prevented from entering Bukarest by the opposition of the Greek <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Only in 1847 was Bishop Josephus Molajoni able to establish his residence in Bukarest. His successor, Angelus Parsi, restored the episcopal palace, which had been destroyed by fire in 1847, and in 1852 brought to Bukarest the English Ladies, and in 1861 the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>. In 1863 Bishop Parsi was succeeded by Josephus Pluym, since 1869 Patriarchal Vicar of Constantinople, who in turn was followed by Ignatius Paoli. After the establishment of <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a> as a kingdom, a movement was set on foot by the Government to release the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects from dependence on a foreign <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and negotiations were begun with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1883 <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> erected two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in Rumania <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the Archdiocese of Bukarest and the <a href="../cathen/08325b.htm">Diocese of Jassy</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was Ignatius Paoli, succeeded in turn by Paulus Josephus Palma (1885-92); Otto Zardetti (1894-95), who was the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Cloud, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, U.S.A. (1889-94), when he was transferred to Bukarest. He resigned this last office in 1895 and died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on 9 May, 1902; Xaverius Hornstein (1896-1905), who built a new episcopal residence and for the second time called the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> to Bukarest; Raymundus Netzhammer, O.S.B., born at Erzingen, <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, 19 January, 1862, professed in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, 1881, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Bukarest 16 September, 1905.
