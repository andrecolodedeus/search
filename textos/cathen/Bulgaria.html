<h1>Bulgaria</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> kingdom in the northeastern part of the Balkan Peninsula, bounded by the Black Sea, the Rhodope Mountains, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, and the Danube; it embraces an area of 37,200 sq. m. The population according to the census of 1900 numbers 3,744,283, divided according to religion into 3,019,296 Greek Orthodox, 28,579 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Greeks, 4524 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 13,809 Gregorian <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, 33,663 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 643,300 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, and 1112 of other creeds; according to nationality into 2,887,860 Bulgarians, 539,656 <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, 89,549 Gypsies, 75,223 Rumanians, 70,887 Greeks, 32,753 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 18,856 Tatars, 13,926 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, and 15,741 of other nationalities. The number of inhabitants in 1905 was 4,028,239.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>, what is now Bulgaria constituted the Roman provinces of Moesia and Thrace, a territory in which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was preached at a very early period, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> in 343. During the migratory period <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> races pushed forward into this region. Some time after the middle of the seventh century, the Bulgars, a people of Hunnic and Finnic stock, who had been driven from their habitations on the Volga as far as the Lower Danube, began to make incursions into Moesia and Thrace. Completing their conquest of the country in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>, they founded an independent kingdom about 680. The Bulgars gradually became amalgamated with the former inhabitants, adopting the nationality and language of the latter, but giving their own name to the ethnographic mixture. The new State often came into conflict with the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>, to which, however, in 718, it lent its support against the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. Prince Boris, or Bogoris (844-845 or 852-888), d. 907), accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> for political reasons and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in 864 or the beginning of 865; he first negotiated with <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> for the creation of a Bulgarian <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, but in the end joined the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>. During the reign of his younger son Symeon (893-927) the ancient Bulgarian State reached the zenith of its prosperity; its territories extended from the Danube to the Rhodope Mountains and from the Black Sea to the Ionian Sea. In 917 Symeon assumed the title of Tsar, and in 924 compelled Byzantium to recognize the Bulgarian Church as an autocephalous <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, with its seat at Ochrida or Achrida. Under his son Peter (927-969) the kingdom began to decline; during the reign of Shishman I the western part proclaimed its independence; two years after Peter's death the eastern section was pledged to the Eastern Empire. The western part, not able to preserve its autonomy, went to pieces in 1018 under the repeated attacks of the Emperor Basil II, surnamed Bulgaroktonos (the slayer of the Bulgarians). Though Basil left the Bulgarian Church its autonomy, the Metropolitans of <a href="../cathen/01103b.htm">Achrida</a> were no longer styled Patriarchs, but <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a>, and after 1025 were chosen from the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, instead of the Bulgarian.

<p>After several futile uprisings against the oppressive Byzantine rule, a fresh Bulgarian insurrection took place about 1185. Two brothers, Peter and Ivan Asen, assumed the leadership, threw off the Byzantine yoke and re-established Symeon's empire. On their death (1197) their youngest brother Kaloyan, or Ivanitza, ruled alone until 1207; he entered into negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, promised to recognize the spiritual supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and in November, 1204, was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with the royal diadem by Cardinal Leo, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>. At the same time Archbishop Basil of Tirnovo was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Bulgaria. This new Bulgarian Church embraced eight <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, Tirnovo being the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> see, but the union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was not of long duration. The new empire soon came into conflict with the recently founded Latin Empire (1204) of Constantinople; the Greeks fanned the dissensions in order to gain the Bulgarians over to their side. King Ivan Asen II (1218-41) formed an alliance with Emperor Vatatzes against the Latin Empire (1234), and again joined the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, which thereupon solemnly recognized the autonomy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Tirnovo (1235). Since that time, with the exception of brief intervals, the Bulgarian Church has persisted in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. In 1236 <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a> pronounced sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> on Asen II, and in 1238 had a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> preached against Bulgaria. The history of the following period shows a succession of struggles with the Greeks, the <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servians</a>, and the Hungarians, of internal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> for the possession of the throne, and of religious disturbances, as, for instance, those consequent on the spread of the Bogomili and the <a href="../cathen/07301a.htm">Hesychasts</a>, all of which weakened the State.

<p>During the fourteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, flushed with victory, invaded the Balkan Peninsula, and under Amurath I overthrew the Servian kingdom in the battle of Kossovo (Field of Blackbirds, 1389), captured Tirnovo, and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> Ivan III Shishman, the last Bulgarian Tsar, thus destroying the Bulgarian hegemony. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shared the fate of the State, and the last Bulgarian patriarch, Euthymius (1375-93), was driven into exile. Only the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01103b.htm">Achrida</a> continued as a Graeco-Bulgarian <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, with Greek or hellenized occupants, until it was suppressed by the Porte in 1767 in consequence of the intrigues of the oecumenical <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. The Greek language prevailed everywhere in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and churches, and the remains of ancient Bulgarian literature were destroyed to a large extent by the Greeks. For almost five centuries the Bulgarian people groaned under the political yoke of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> domination of the Greeks, yet continuous <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> did not avail to obliterate the memory of the nation's former greatness. The nineteenth century was destined to bring liberty to the Bulgarians, as well as to other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peoples of the Balkan Peninsula. The self-sacrificing generosity of wealthy Bulgarians made it possible to establish Bulgarian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (the first at Gabrovo, 1835) and printing presses (at Saloniki, 1839, <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, 1840, Constantinope., 1843), by which the national culture and patriotic sentiment were elevated. The reawakened national feeling first manifested itself in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order.



<p>In 1860 a representative body of the Bulgarian nation requested the Greek patriarch at Constantinople to recognize their national church, to accord them freedom in the selection of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and to appoint Bulgarian, rather than Greek <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> to Bulgarian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople refused these concessions. This act inflamed the national feeling and was followed by the expulsion of the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and finally insurrections against <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> authority. To ensure its supremacy, the Porte sought to mediate between the parties, but fresh negotiations were productive of no further result, and the Sultan by a firman of 11 March, 1870, granted the Bulgarians an exarchate of their own, independent of the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. In 1872, the first Bulgarian <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> was chosen by an assembly of Bulgarian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. In a council at which only twenty-nine <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assisted the oecumenical patriarch solemnly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the Bulgarian Church and declared it <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a>.

<p>National autonomy followed close upon ecclesiastical independence. On May, 1876, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Government perpetrated unspeakable atrocities in the suppression of a Bulgarian insurrection. These horrors might never have touched the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the civilized world had it not been for the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and enterprise of Januarius Aloysius MacGahan, an American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (b. in Perry County, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, 12 June, 1844, d. at Constantinople, 9 June, 1878). As correspondent of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> "Daily News", and accompanied by Eugene Schuyler, Commissioner of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Government, MacGahan was the only journalist to visit the devastated districts; he obtained the evidence of eyewitnesses and, supplementing this with his own observation, published a mass of facts which enabled Mr. Gladstone to arouse among the English-speaking peoples a lively sympathy for the Bulgarian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. A conference of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> powers demanded of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a> the erection of an autonomous Bulgarian province. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, however, and the Peace of San Stefano created an autonomous Bulgarian principality, tributary to the Porte. The Berlin Congress of 1878 abrogated some of the provisions of the Peace of San Stefano and divided Greater Bulgaria into an autonomous Bulgarian principality and a province of Eastern Rumelia under a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> governor-general, to be appointed by the Porte every five years, but subject to the approval of the Powers. On 22 February, 1879, the first Bulgarian assembly of notables convened in the principality; on 28 April the new constitution was signed; and on 29 April Prince Alexander of Battenberg was chosen as sovereign by the first national assembly. In Eastern Rumelia, from the very first the trend of events pointed to union with the Bulgarian principality. In September, 1885, an insurrection broke out, and a provisional regency proclaimed the union with Bulgaria. In September, Alexander announced from Philippopolis the union of the two countries and, after repelling a <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servian</a> invasion, received recognition as Governor-General of Eastern Rumelia (5 April, 1886). The unexpected independence which Alexander had shown in the face of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, brought him into disfavour with that power, and a military conspiracy, secretly supported by <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, was successful in having him transported across the frontier (20 August, 1886). He was recalled, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, by the popular voice, after ten days, but, not wishing to rule without <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia's</a> favour, which Bulgaria found indispensable, and yet not being able to gain the Tsar's friendship., he abdicated, 7 September, 1886. A regency, under Stambuloff, administered the national affairs until a new sovereign was elected by the National Assembly. The choice fell on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> prince, Ferdinand of Saxe-Koburg-Kohary, 7 July, 1887. As Ferdinand at first left the national policy in the hands of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia's</a> enemy, Stambuloff, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, as well as the Porte, refused to recognize the new king. Only after the assassination of Stambuloff (1895) was a reconciliation with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> effected. The Sultan then recognized Ferdinand as prince and governor-general, in view of the fact that Ferdinand had his son Boris, heir to the throne, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Greek <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (1896). The <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> progress of the country is retarded by financial complications, by partisanship in politics, and by the unrest incident to the so-called Macedonian question.

<p>While the Bulgarians were contending with the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> autonomy, and the patriarch refused to make any concession, a movement was set on foot among the Bulgarians which pointed towards union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 30 December, 1860, 120 deputies of the people petitioned the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> to receive them into the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> on condition of the recognition of their language and liturgy, and the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of their own nationality; almost 60,000 of their fellow-countrymen joined in the request. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> himself, 21 January, 1861, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Solkolski its first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Bulgaria. This movement, however, did not win the support of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, while the greatest obstacles were placed in its way by <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Constantntinople. Sokolski lapsed back into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in June, 1861, and embarked for Odessa on a Russian vessel; the majority of the Bulgarian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> attached themselves to the recently founded national exarchate.
