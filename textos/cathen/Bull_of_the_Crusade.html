<h1>Bull of the Crusade</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> granting <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to those who took part in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">wars against the infidels</a>. These <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> were similar to those which, as far back as the eleventh century, had been granted to the faithful of the Spanish Mark who took part in the work of building churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, or who gave <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to be devoted to this purpose. The first of these <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> which concerned <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was that of <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> to the Counts Berenguer Ram&oacute;n de Barcelona and Armengal de Besal&uacute; in 1089 at the time of the reconquest of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, and that of Gelasius II to Alfonso I of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, when he undertook to reconquer Saragossa in 1118. <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> in 1265 issued a general <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> for the whole of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, when the Kings of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon and Castile</a> joined in the expedition against Murcia. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> these pontifical concessions became more and more frequent; in the reign of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> kings alone they were granted in 1478, 1479, 1481, 1482, 1485, 1494, 1503, and 1505, and were continued during the following reigns, that granted by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> in 1573 being renewed by his successors.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> given by the faithful in response to this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, which were at first used exclusively for carrying on the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">war against the infidels</a>, were afterwards used for the construction and repair of churches and other <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works; sometimes they were also used to defray expenses of the State. The Cortes of Valladolid of 1523 and that of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> of 1592 petitioned that this money should not be used for any other purpose than that for which it had originally been intended by the donors, but, notwithstanding the provisions made by Philip III in compliance with this request, the abuse already mentioned continued. After 1847 the funds derived from this source were devoted to the endowment of churches and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, this disposition being ratified by a law in 1849 and in the Concordat of 1851, still in force.

<p>In virtue of the concessions granted by this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, the faithful of the Spanish dominions who had fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conditions could gain the plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, granted to those who fought for the reconquest of the Holy Land and to those who went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the year of Jubilee, provided they went to confession and received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. They enjoyed also the privilege of being absolved twice of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and censures reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the ordinary, except open <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and others concerning <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>; to have <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> which could not be fulfilled without difficulty commuted by their confessor, unless failure to fulfil them would be to the disadvantage of another; also simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of perpetual chastity, of <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land. Those who visited five churches or altars, or the same altar five times, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the intentions of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>, could gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> granted to those who visited the stations in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, moreover, permitted the faithful of the Spanish dominions to eat meat on all the days of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and other days of fast and abstinence, except <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a>, the Fridays of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, the last four days of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, and the vigils of the feasts of the Nativity, Pentecost, the Assumption, and Sts. Peter and Paul.
