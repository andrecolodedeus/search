<h1>Burchard of Basle</h1>  

<p>(Also of HASENBURG or ASUEL, from his ancestral castle in Western <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>).

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle in the eleventh century and a warm partisan of Henry IV (1056-1106). He belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the counts of Neuenburg, or Neuchatel, was b. towards the middle of the eleventh century, and d. 12 April, 1107. Having entered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle (1072) by Henry IV; in recognition of this favour he was ever loyal to the king, and became one of his foremost advisers. In Henry's first difficulties with the Saxons (1073-75) Burchard rendered him all possible assistance. When the conflict between the king and <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a> (1073-85) broke out, Burchard was among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who assembled at Worms (January, 1076), proclaimed the deposition of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and wrote him an insulting letter. Together with Bishop Huzmann of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> he also went to Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> for the purpose of inducing the Lombard <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to take similar action with regard to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In this he was successful; a synod was assembled at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, and the Lombard <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> renounced obedience to <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>. For these rebellious acts Burchard was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and deposed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> synod of 1076; a similar sentence was inflicted on other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and on Burchard's royal master. King Henry obtained <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> at <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a> in January, 1077; and Burchard, who accompanied him on the penitential <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, was reinstated in office.

<p>During the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in 1077 and the following years, between Henry and his rival, Duke Rudolf of Suabia, raised to the throne by many princes, Burchard stood on the side of Henry, in whose interest he fought repeatedly, both against Rudolf and his supporter, Berthold of Zahringen. In 1078 Burchard and his friend suffered a crushing defeat, and he barely saved his life by precipitate flight. But the fortunes of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> turned; Burchard and his partisans ravaged the country of Alemannia, or Suabia, the home of Rudolf and Berthold, and many cruelties were committed. Churches, sanctuaries, and perhaps <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> as well were destroyed by the reckless and savage soldiery. But it all helped the cause of Henry and weakened that of his rival, who was finally vanquished and killed in 1080. Burchard was rewarded for his services with grants of land from Henry. It is not certain that he was present in the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a> (Tyrol) in June, 1080, where the partisans of Henry again deposed <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> and elected in his stead <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Wibert</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. He was with Henry, however, when the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> king took possession of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 21 March, 1084, and it may be taken for granted that he assisted at the installation of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a> (1084-1100) and at the imperial <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Henry, which events occurred on the 24th and 31st of March respectively. Shortly afterwards Burchard returned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> with his royal master.

<p>Two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held there during the year 1085, in which Burchard, though not present, was directly concerned. The first, in the latter part of April, was held at Quedlinburg by the partisans of Gregory VII; it condemned all adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, including Bishop Burchard. Henry's faction held its synod at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in the early part of May; Pope Gregory and all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> loyal to him were deposed. For the next twenty years Burchard was less active in the cause of Henry, but he remained to the end loyal to his king. When Henry was hard pressed in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by his son Conrad, in rebellion since 1093, and other enemies, Burchard was one of the very few <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who brought him any comfort. In 1095 he appeared at the king's court at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and after Henry's return to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> he paid several other visits to the royal court. How much Henry counted on the loyalty of Burchard was made evident in a letter which the monarch wrote to the princes of the empire from <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> in the early part of the year 1106, shortly before his death. Henry besought the princes to accord him sufficient time to consult with the princes and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> about the matters relating to his abdication or reconciliation with his rebellious son Henry V (1106-25), and among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> faithful to him he mentioned the name of Burchard of Basle.

<p>Burchard, however, did not always remain an uncompromising adversary of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. After the death of Gregory VII, particularly after the election of <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> (1088-99), his sentiments underwent a change. He sought a reconciliation with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; and in order to prove his interest in purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and spiritual matters he became instrumental in the erection of several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> or other religious institutions. Among those founded by him may be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban</a> in Basle, and chapterhouse of Grandis Vallis to the south of Basle, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. John, erected partly by his brother and partly by himself at Erlach in the neighbourhood of his ancestral castle. In spite of his attachment to Henry IV he died fully reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.
