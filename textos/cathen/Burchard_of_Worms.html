<h1>Burchard of Worms</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of that see, b. of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, after the middle of the tenth century; d. 20 August, 1025. He received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in Coblenz and other places, and ultimately entered the service of Archbishop Willigis of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (975-1011), by whom he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. He rose gradually in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rank and was finally appointed by Willigis first chamberlain, and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> or judge of the city. In these offices he showed so much discretion and impartiality, that his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> reached Emperor <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>. During a personal interview with his imperial master (1000) he was appointed to the vacant Bishopric of Worms; a few days later he was advanced to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the episcopal dignity by Willigis at Heiligenstadt. Thenceforth he laboured unceasingly for the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. He rebuilt the walls of Worms and with the approval of Henry II tore down the stronghold of a certain Duke Otto, which served as a place of refuge to criminals and malefactors. Between 1023 and 1025 he <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a celebrated body of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the "Leges et Statuta familiae S. Petri Wormatiensis", with the purpose of insuring the impartial administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. (Boos, in Urkundenbuch der Stadt Worms, I, 1886; Weiland, in Mon. Ger. Hist.: Leges, IV, 1.) Many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and churches were erected by him. On the site of the aforesaid Otto's castle he built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>; his sister Mathilda was placed in charge of a community of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, whose home was practically rebuilt; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Peter at Worms was reconstructed and dedicated in 1016. He also devoted himself to the formation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and to the instruction of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> generally. To stimulate their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he would at times answer difficult questions submitted to him. The prevalent evils he tried to reform through visitations and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>.

<p>For the sake of uniformity in all church matters he drew up a manual for the instruction and guidance of young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, this is his well-known "Collectarium canonum" or "Decretum" in twenty books, a compilation of ecclesiastical law and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, drawn from previous similar collections, the penitential books, the writings of the Fathers, the decrees of councils and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>. For more than a century, until the publication of the "Decretum" of Gratian (c. 1150), this was a widely used practical guide of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, often quoted as "Brocardus". The nineteenth book, known as "Corrector, seu medicus", was circulated frequently as a separate work and was esteemed as a practical confessor's guide. (Von Scherer, Kirchenrecht, I, 238.) The work was undertaken at the suggestion of Brunicho, the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the Worms Cathedral, and was executed with the help of Bishop Walter of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> and Abbot Olbert of <a href="../cathen/06407c.htm">Gembloux</a> (ed. Foucher, Paris, 1549; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXL, Paris, 1853). Burchard enjoyed the special esteem of his imperial masters. With <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> he was on the most intimate terms; Henry II and Conrad II made visits to him in 1009 and 1025 respectively. Personally Burchard was a saintly man. His biographer, probably an ecclesiastic, praises his devotion to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, his <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, his fairness and charity towards others.
