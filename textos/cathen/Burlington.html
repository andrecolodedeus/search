<h1>Burlington</h1>  

<p>(Burlingtonensis).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> established 14 July, 1853; comprises the whole <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">State of Vermont</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> an area of 9135 square miles. The territory now making up the <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">State of Vermont</a> was not only discovered but first settled by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a> bestowed on the State in 1609 the name it bears and the first Mass said within its boundaries was offered up in 1666 by a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the little fort of St. Anne on Isle Lamothe &mdash;now the site of a shrine of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> &mdash; where a few soldiers upheld the authority of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1668 Bishop Laval of Quebec went there and thus gave to Vermont the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the first episcopal visitation and ministration in New England and probably in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. During the years that followed, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and other missionaries traversed the State and left the evidences of their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the converted Indians and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers in many villages. In 1734 there were fourteen <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> grouped about a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Alburgh. After <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> had been ceded to the English in 1760 many New England emigrants went to <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, but the Bishops of Quebec still continued to look after the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there. When the <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Diocese of Boston</a> was created in 1810 the <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">State of Vermont</a> was included within its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and the venerable Father Matignon of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> visited Burlington in 1815 and found about one hundred <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> there without a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or church. Father Migneault of Chambly, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> was a frequent visitor for a number of years, ministering to the scattered <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> along the border. <a href="../cathen/06084b.htm">Father James Fitton</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> was another pioneer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The first resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Vermont was Rev. Jeremiah O'Callaghan, a native of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, whose eccentric notions on the question of <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> got him into difficulty with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his native diocese; he was sent to Burlington in 1830 by Bishop Fenwick and remained there until 1854, his influence and pastoral <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> radiating far and wide. He built St. Peter's church, Burlington in 1832. He died at Holyoke, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, 23, February, 1861. In 1837 the Rev. John D. Daly, another eccentric but learned man, commenced to care for the missions in the southern part of the State and laboured until 1854, when he retired to New York where he died in 1870. Notable also among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> ministering in the State during this early period were Fathers William Ivers, George Hamilton, Edward McGowan, James Walsh, M. Petithomme, P. Drolet, and M. Chevailier. In 1843, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the State numbered 4940, but the building of railroads and the establishment of numerous public works soon brought a steady increase.

<p>In 1853 on the petition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Provence of New York, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> erected Vermont into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with Burlington as the titular city. The Very Rev. Louis De Goesbriand, then <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Diocese of Cleveland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, was named the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in New York by <a href="../cathen/02387a.htm">Archbishop Bedini</a>, 30 October, 1853. He was born 4 August, 1816, at Saint-Urbain, Finist&egrave;re, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He studied at Asint-Sulpice, Paris, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> 30 July, 1840. He found on his arrival in Vermont five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, ten churches, and about 20,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In January, 1855, he went to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to secure <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and with the aid of those who answered his appeal for volunteers, new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were organized, churches built, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> opened, and the work of evangelizing went on vigorously. The first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was held in Burlington, 4 and 5 October, 1855, at which nine <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attended. On 17 July, 1890, Bishop De Goesbriand celebrated the golden jubilee of his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and in 1892 he asked for a coadjutor. The choice fell on the Rev. John Stephen Michaud, then <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Bennington, the son of an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> mother and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> father and born at Burlington, 24 Novenber, 1843. He made his studies at St. Joseph's Seminary, Troy, New York, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 7 June, 1873. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10422a.htm">Modra</a> and coadjutor of Burlington, 29 June, 1892. Bishop De Goesbriand retired to live in the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphan Asylum</a> at Burlington and died 3 November, 1899, the dean of the American <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Bishop Michaud immediately succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Bishop De Goesbriand was one of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who attended the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in 1869.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities now represented in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are the Fathers of St. Edmond (C.S.E.), the <a href="../cathen/06330b.htm">Brothers of St. Gabriel</a>, Sisters of Charity of Providence, <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a> and of the Seven Dolours, Sisters of the Holy Ghost, Ladies of St. Joseph, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, Hospital <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame, of the Presentation, of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and of the Assumption. There are in the diocese 99 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 88 secular, 11 regular; 95 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 70 with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, and 27 missions with churches; 20 stations; 275 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities; 15 <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; 3 academies for boys, 9 for girls; 21 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 6096 pupils; 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 260 pupils, 220 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> asylum; 2 colleges for boys; 2 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population estimated 75,953; children under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> care 6175. The <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Winooski Park is named after <a href="../cathen/01320c.htm">Fanny Allen</a>, daughter of General Ethan Allen of Revolutionary fame, and the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of New England birth to become a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>.
