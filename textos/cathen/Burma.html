<h1>Burma</h1>  

<p>Before its annexation by the British Burma consisted of the kingdoms of Ava and Pegu. In 1548 <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> petitioned Father Rodriguez for missionaries to go to Pegu, but nothing is known as to the outcome of his request. In 1699 the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Siam and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meliapur had a dispute concerning the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Pegu, and Cardinal de Tournon, <em>Legatus a latere</em>, decided against the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. The actual work of evangelizing Ava and Pegu did not begin until the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a> who in 1722, sent Father Sigismond de Calchi a <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite</a>, and Father Vittoni, of the same order, to Burma. After many trials and tribulations they succeeded in obtaining permission to preach with full liberty the Gospel of Christ. In 1741 <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> definitely established the mission, appointing Father Galizia <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, and placing the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> in charge of the work; but in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which distracted those regions during the eighteenth century the last two members of the order who had remained in the country were killed. The <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> having given up the mission, <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> sent Monsignor Frederic Cao, a member of the Congregation of Pious Schools, and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15746b.htm">Zama</a> (18 June, 1830), <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> placed the mission under the Oblates of <a href="../cathen/12102a.htm">Pinerolo</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, by appointing (5 July, 1842) Monsignor Giovanni Ceretti, a member of this institute, and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01161a.htm">Adrianople</a>, as first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. About this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> (1845) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the two kingdoms numbered 2500. In 1848 Monsignor John Balma succeeded as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> (5 September, 1848), but the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the British rendered his labours ineffectual, and the mission was abandoned about 1852.

<p>The British had in reality begun to assume control of Burma in 1824, but it was not until 20 December, 1852, that the East <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> Company, after a bloody <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, annexed the entire kingdom of Pegu, a territory as large as <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Many years later the kingdom of Ava was also taken by the British, and with conquest of Rangoon the whole of Burma came into the possession of Great Britain. The Oblates of <a href="../cathen/12102a.htm">Pinerolo</a> having withdrawn from the mission, the vicariate was placed, in 1855, under the control of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Siam. At this date the kingdom of Ava and Pegu contained 11 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 5320 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>Burma is bounded on the east by <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and Siam, on the West by Assam and Bengal. Its area is approximately 171,430 square miles, while that of Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> is 120,947 square miles. Notwithstanding this large extent of territory, Burma has a population of only 8,000,000 inhabitants. For some ten years the mission remained under the administration of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Siam; but such a condition could not be indefinitely prolonged without compromising its future. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (27 November, 1806) accordingly divided Burma into three vicariates, named respectively, with references to their geographical positions, Northern, Southern, and Eastern Burma. The boundaries then fixed were abrogated (28 June, 1870) by another <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, which constituted these three vicariates as they now are.
<h2>Northern Burma</h2>

<p>This vicariate, which has been entrusted to the Missions Etrang&egrave;res of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, is bounded on the north by the Chinese province of Yun-nan, on the east by the River Salwen, on the south by Karenni and Lower Burma, and on the west by Manipur, the Garo Hills, and the independent territories of Tipperah and Assam. In a population of 3,500,000 there are 7248 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, whose spiritual needs are served by 22 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the Missions Etrang&egrave;res of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and 3 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with 47 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The vicariate also possesses 18 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 754 children, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 22 students, 2 boarding-schools with 160 pupils and 6 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> with 315 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. This is the most dense of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> is at Mandalay. The stations having one <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and a resident missionary are Pyinmana, Yam&egrave;thin, Magyidaw, Chanthagon, Myokine, Chaung-u, Nabet, Shwebo, Chanthaywa, Monhla, Bhano, and Maymyo. At Mandalay there are, besides the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the Tamil <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Xavier, a Chinese church, and that of St. John's Asylum. The language commonly used in this vicariate is Burmese, but residents ordinarily employ their respective native tongues, which amounts for the Chinese church at Mandalay. This city of 188,000 inhabitants is a bustling centre of traffic between Lower Burma and the Province of Yun-nan; hence the large Chinese element in the population.
<h2>Eastern Burma</h2>

<p>The vicariate is entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> Seminary of Foreign Missions. Its boundaries, determined by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 26 August, 1889, are: on the north the Chinese Province of Yun-nan; on the east, the Mekong, the subsequent course of which bounds Cambodia and Annam; on the south, Karenni and Shan; on the west, the River Salween and part of the course of the Sittang. The vicariate is made up of two quite distinct portions connected almost at right angles by a somewhat narrow strip of territory. The first of these portions comprises Toungoo and the regions lying between the Sittang and the Salween as far as 20 north latitude; from this parallel of latitude the second portion stretches north to the Tropic of Cancer, bordered on the east and south by <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, Annam, and Siam, and on the west by the River Salween.

<p>The beginnings of the mission go back to 1868 when the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> Seminary of Foreign Missions sent thither Monsignor Biffi as <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>, accompanied by Sebastian Carbode, Conti, and Rocco Tornatori. The last named of these is the present <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, and has resided forty years in the vicariate. There are 10, 300 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in this vicariate, the population of which is not exactly known, but amounts to something like 2,000,000. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> resides in the Leitko Hills and visits 130 villages in the Karenni district, where there are 10,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> &#151; almost the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the vicariate. There is a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, with 65 children, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Sisters of Nazareth of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, with 40 girls, and, in some of the villages, the beginnings of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with a few pupils. Toungoo, in the south of the vicariate, with 300 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> has an English <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of 130 children of various races, a Native <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of 100 children, and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Sisters of the Reparation of Nazareth of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> with 70 girls. There are 10 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In 1902 there were 140 conversions from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a> and 6 from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The stations provided with are, besides the residence of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, Toungoo, Northern Karenni, Yedashe, and Karenni.
<h2>Southern Burma</h2>

<p>This vicariate, entrusted to the Missions Etrang&egrave;res of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, comprises all the territory included in British (Lower) Burma before the annexation of Upper Burma, with the exception, however, of the province of Arakan (attached in 1879 to the <a href="../cathen/04601b.htm">Diocese of Dacca</a>) and the Toungoo district (assigned to the Vicariate of Eastern Burma). It is, therefore, bounded on the east by the <a href="../cathen/04601b.htm">Diocese of Dacca</a>, on the north by Eastern Burma, on the west by Siam, and on the south by the sea. It extends from the nineteenth to the tenth parallel of north latitude, and, beginning from Moulmein, forms a long and rather narrow strip of land shut in between Siam on the one side and the sea on the other.

<p>In a population estimated at 4,000,000 as many as 45,579 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are found distributed among 23 stations, the most important of which in respect of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population are: Rangoon, with 2336 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; Moulmein, 1400; Bassein, 1040; Myaung-mya, 4000; Kanaztogon, 4482; Mittagon, 3000; Maryland, 2412; Gyobingauk Tharrawady, 2200. The seat of <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> is at Rangoon. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> number 49 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the vicariate has 231 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are conducted by the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, of St. Joseph of the Apparition, and of St. Francis Xavior, those known under this last name being natives. The vicariate supports 12 Anglo-native <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 4.01 children, and 65 Burman or Tamil <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> which give instruction to 2200 pupils. The <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, 9 in number, take care of 55 old people at Rangoon, and the Missionaries of Mary have an asylum sheltering 100 children, besides which there are 21 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, containing 790 children, under the care of the above mentioned <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. This vicariate, therefore, is in further advanced in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> than the other two, a condition due to its greater accessibility and the British influence, which is more fully developed in these regions. In 1845, as has been seen, there were only 2500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Burma, sixty years later there are 59,127 &#151; a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the activity of the missionaries and a pledge for the future.

<p>Monsignor Alexander Cardot, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09265a.htm">Limyra</a>, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Southern Burma, was born at Fresse, Haute-Sa&ocirc;ne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 9 January, 1859, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of Luneil and Vesoul and of the Missions Etrang&egrave;res. Monsignor Cardot began his labours in the mission field in 1879, and in 1893 was appointed coadjutor to Bishop Bigandet, his predecessor in the vicariate, who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him at Rangoon (24 June, 1893). He succeeded to the vicariate on the death of Bishop Bigandet, 19 March, 1894.
