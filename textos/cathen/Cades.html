<h1>Cades</h1>  

<p>The name, according to the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, of three, or probably four cities mentioned in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>.

<p>(1) Cades, or Cadesbarne [<a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Qadesh</em> "Holy", and <em>Q. Barnea</em>; the meaning of <em>Barnea</em> is uncertain], a city on the extreme southern border of Palestine (<a href="../bible/num020.htm#vrs16">Numbers 20:16</a>; <a href="../bible/num034.htm#vrs4">34:4</a>; <a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs3">Joshua 15:3</a>). In Psalms xxviii (xxix), 8 the name is extended to the surrounding <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. That Cades and Cadesbarne are one place is seen by comparing <a href="../bible/num013.htm#vrs27">Numbers 13:27</a>, with <a href="../bible/num032.htm#vrs8">Numbers 32:8</a>, <a href="../bible/deu001.htm#vrs19">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>, etc. In <a href="../bible/gen014.htm#vrs7">Genesis 14:7</a>, it is called En Mishpat (<a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, <em>fontem Misphat</em>), "fountain of decision", or "judgment", which probably was its earlier name. The two names seem to indicated that a sanctuary with an <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> existed at the place in pre-Israelitic times. Cades, after Sinai, holds the most important place in the history of the forty years' wandering of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. They came from Horeb (Sinai) through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Pharan, after eleven days' journey (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#vrs2">Deuteronomy 1:2, 19</a>), with the intention of invading <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> from the south (Ib., i, 20 sq.). From here spies were sent to explore the country, and here, on their return, forty days after, the discouraging reports of all but Caleb and <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a> provoked a mutiny which changed the course of events. In punishment the people were condemned to wander thirty-eight years more, and all who had reached manhood, except Caleb and Josue, were to die in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. To escape this fate the mass of the people, instead of obeying the command to return towards the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, left Moses at Cades and pushed northward with the purpose of penetrating into the Promised Land, but met with disastrous defeat near Horma (<a href="../bible/num013.htm#vrs2">Numbers 13:2</a>-<a href="../bible/num014.htm#vrs45">14:45</a>; <a href="../bible/deu001.htm#vrs22">Deuteronomy 1:22-44</a>). During the stay at Cades occured the death of Mary, the sister of Moses, and the second <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> flow of water, on which latter occasion Moses and Aaron were excluded from the Land of Promise for their want of trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/num020.htm#vrs1">Numbers 20:1-13</a>). Cades was probably also the scene of the rebellion of Core, Dathan, and Abiron (<a href="../bible/num016.htm">Numbers 16</a>). Lastly, it was from Cades that Moses, when about to begin the march to the table-land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, sent to the King of <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a> to obtain permission to pass this territory. The permission being refused, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> were forced to turn aside from <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a>, passing probably through Wady el-Ithm, at the southern end of the valley of the Arabah (<a href="../bible/num020.htm#vrs14">Numbers 20:14 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/deu002.htm#vrs1">Deuteronomy 2:1 sqq.</a>).

<p>Opinions differ about the length of the stay at Cades. Many hold that the command to retrace their steps towards the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> was carried out after the defeat of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> near Horma, and that they came to Cades a second time at the beginning of the fortieth year of wandering. The second stay is said to be indicated by <a href="../bible/num020.htm#vrs1">Numbers 20:1 sqq.</a> In this opinion the stations (seats of headquarters and of the tabernacle) in <a href="../bible/num033.htm#vrs19">Numbers 33:19-35</a>, i.e. from Remmomphares to Asiongaber, belong to the years of wandering between the first and the second visit to Cades. It is more probable, however, that the headquarters and the tabernacle remained at Cades all these years, while the people roamed about in accordance with <a href="../bible/deu001.htm#vrs40">Deuteronomy 1:40</a>, <a href="../bible/deu002.htm#vrs1">2:1 sqq.</a> In this case the stations up to Hesmona (<a href="../bible/num033.htm#vrs29">Numbers 33:29</a>) would belong to the journey from Sinai to Cades; those following Hesmona, to the march towards <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a>. The insertion of verses 36-40 after verse 29 would then seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, but the change would clear up this part of the itinerary.

<p>A good deal of controversy has existed concerning the site of Cades, no less than eighteen places having been proposed. This may now be considered as settled in favour of 'Ain Qadis or Gadis, discovered by J. Rowlands in 1842, fifty miles south of Bersabee. Its only serious rival, 'Ain el-Weibeh, on the western edge of the Arabah, forty-five miles farther east, which was advocated by Robinson and others, is now generally abandoned. 'Ain Qadis ("Holy Well") preserves the name <em>Cades</em> both in meaning and etymology, and best satisfies the scriptural data. These place Cades to the south of, and close to, the Negeb, the "south" (<a href="../bible/num013.htm#vrs30">Numbers 13:30</a>), or "south country" (<a href="../bible/gen020.htm#vrs1">Genesis 20:1</a>) of our English version (Cf. <a href="../bible/gen020.htm#vrs1">Genesis 20:1</a>; <a href="../bible/num013.htm#vrs23">Numbers 13:23, 30</a>; <a href="../bible/num014.htm#vrs43">14:43 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/deu001.htm#vrs19">Deuteronomy 1:19-20</a>), in the Desert of Sin, which was north-east of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Pharan (Cf. <a href="../bible/num020.htm#vrs1">Numbers 20:1</a>; <a href="../bible/num027.htm#vrs14">27:14</a>; <a href="../bible/num033.htm#vrs36">33:36</a>; <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#vrs51">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>), near the middle of the southern frontier of the land assigned to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/num034.htm#vrs4">Numbers 34:4</a>; <a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs3">Joshua 15:3</a>). It must therefore be sought in the north of the barren plateau Badiet et-Tih, "the desert of wandering", about midway between the Arabah and the Mediterranean, that is in the region in which 'Ain Qadis is situated. Moreover, the position of 'Ain Qadis, at a short distance from the junction of the main roads leading north, and its abundant supply of good water, a rare thing in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, are advantages which must have made it an important point, and which would be most likely to attract the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>. <a href="../bible/num020.htm#vrs2">Numbers 20:2 sqq.</a>, is no objection to the identification. Cades, wherever situated, must have been near a supply of water. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> in all likelihood occurred at a distance from the town. Still, it is quite possible that the springs (there are several) may for some reason have temporarily run dry, and the cliff from underneath which issue the waters of 'Ain Qadis may well be the rock struck by Moses' rod. In the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> text of <a href="../bible/sir024.htm">Sirach 24</a>, mention is made of the palms of Cades. But the readings, <em>en Eggadois, en Gaddi, en Gaddois</em>, found in some <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, seem to show that Engaddi, where palms were abundant, was referred to the sacred writer. The Sixtine ed. of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> has <em>en aiggialois</em>, "on the seashore".

<p>(2) CADES [<a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Q&eacute;d&eacute;sh</em> "sanctuary"], a city of the Negeb or "south country" (<a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs23">Joshua 15:23</a>). It is sometimes identified with Cadesbarne, but is more probably distinct from it.

<p>(3) CADES (or CEDES) OF THE HETHITES (HITITES), a city which critical conjecture substitutes for Hodsi <a href="../bible/2sa024.htm#vrs6">2 Samuel 24:6</a>. It is identified with <em>Qodshu</em> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> monuments, and is generally placed on the Lake of Homs (Emesa), <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, at the point where the Orontes issues from it. (See also the article <a href="../cathen/03475b.htm">CEDES</a>.)
