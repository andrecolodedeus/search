<h1>Caesarea Palaestinae</h1>  

<p>(Caesarea Maritima.) A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of Palestine. In Greek antiquity the city was called <em>Pyrgos Stratonos</em> (Straton's Tower), after a Greek adventurer or a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sidonian King; under this name it antedates, perhaps, Alexander the Great. <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">King Herod</a> named it Caesarea in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, and built there <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, palaces, a theatre, an amphitheatre, a port, and numerous monuments, with <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnades</a> and colossal <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>. The civil life of the new city began in 13 B.C., from which time Caesarea was the civil and military capital of Judaea, and as such was the official residence of the Roman procurators, e.g. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> and Felix. <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> and Titus made it a Roman colony, <em>Colonia Prima Flavia Augusta Caesarea.</em> Under <a href="../cathen/13743a.htm">Alexander Severus</a> it became the civil <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Palestine, and later, when Palestine had been divided into three provinces, it remained the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Palaestina Prima. St. Peter established the church there when he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs11">Acts 10:11</a>); <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> often sojourned there (ix, 30, xviii, 22, xxi, 8), and was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> there for two years before being taken to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (xxiii, 23, xxv, 1-13). However, there is no record of any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Caesarea until the second century. At the end of this century a council was held there to regulate the celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. In the third century <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> took refuge at <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>, and wrote there many of his exegetic and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works, among others the famous <a href="../cathen/07316a.htm">"Hexapla"</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of which was for a long time preserved in the episcopal <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of that city. Through <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and the scholarly <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, St. Pamphilus, the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Caesarea won a universal reputation. <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">St. Gregory the Wonder-Worker</a>, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil the Great</a>, and others came from afar to study there. its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> passed for the richest in antiquity; it was there that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> performed much of his Scriptural labours. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was probably destroyed either in 614 by the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, or about 637 by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. As <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Palaestina Prima, subject to the Patriarchate of Antioch, Caesarea had the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> among its suffragans till 451, when Juvenalis succeeded in establishing the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Caesarea had then thirty-two suffragen sees (Revue de l'Orient chr&eacute;t., 1899, 56). <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a> (III, 533-74) mentions thirty-two Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Caesarea, but his list is very incomplete. Among the more celebrated are Theotecnus, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>; the famous church historian <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, a disciple of St. Pamphilus; Acacius, the leader of an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> group; the historian <a href="../cathen/06407b.htm">Gelasius of Cyzicus</a>; St. John the Khozibite in the sixth century; and Anastasius, a writer of the eleventh century. During the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, Caesarea had many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> has <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> an entire work (De martyribus Palaestinae). Among them were St. Hadrian, whose church has just been discovered; Sts. <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>, Paul, Prophyrius, and others. Another illustrious personage of Caesarea is the sixth-century Byzantine historian Procopius. When King Baldwin I took the city in 1101, it was still very rich. There was found the famous <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> known as the <a href="../cathen/06719a.htm">Holy Grail</a>, believed to have been used at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>, preserved now at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and often mentioned in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> poems. The city was rebuilt by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, but on a smaller scale. A list of thirty-six <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, from 1101 to 1496; is given by <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a> (III, 1285-1290) and Eubel (I, 159; II, 126). During the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> occupation the Latin <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> had ten suffragen <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Caesarea is still preserved by the Greeks of the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, as it is by the Latins merely as a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>. The present name of the city is Kaisariyeh. Since 1884 a colony of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> Bosnians has occupied the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> city, which covers a space of about 1800 feet, north to south, and 7500 feet, east to west. The ancient walls, bastions, and ditches are well preserved. The ruins of the Roman city extend to a distance of about four miles; they are the largest in Palestine, and are used as a stone-quarry for Jaffa and Gaza, and even for <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. One sees there, crowded together, the haven of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, restored by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, the amphitheatre large enough to contain 20,000 spectators, remains of canals and aqueducts, a hippodrome with a splendid obelisk of rose granite, <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnades</a>, ruins of <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and of at least two churches, and other stupendous relics of past greatness.
