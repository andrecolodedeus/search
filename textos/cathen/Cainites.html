<h1>Cainites</h1>  

<p>A name used for (1) the descendants of <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a>, (2) a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> and <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">Antinomians</a>.
<h2 id="section1">The descendants of Cain</h2>

<p>The <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs17">Genesis 4:17-22</a>) mentions nine of <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain's</a> descendants in the direct line: <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Henoch</a>, Irad, Maviael, <a href="../cathen/10048b.htm">Mathusael</a>, and Lamech, who had four children: Jabel and Jubal by his wife Ada, and Tubalcain with his sister Noemi by his second wife Sella.

<p>The etymology of several of these names is obscure because it is uncertain whether they are Hebrew, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a>, or Sumerian. The derivation of Mathusael, however, is obvious, mutusha-ilu being the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> for "vassal of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". Maviael, if the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> reading is right, would mean "God is my life-giver"; but according to the <a href="../cathen/07175a.htm">Hebrew text</a> Mehujael would mean "wiped out by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". Most likely, however, the word is <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> and connected with <em>amel ilu</em>, "man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". Lamech is perhaps connected with <em>lamga</em>, the Sumerian for "servant" (of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>). <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> "built a city and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch". To some scholars this has suggested "dedication" as the Hebrew derivation of Henoch; but others see in it the name of the famous Sumerian city, Unug (later Uruk, Erech, Warka). For Irad no satisfactory etymology has been found; it means, perhaps, "scion" from <em>arada</em>, "to sprout". It is remarkable that amongst the Sethites four names occur similar to those of Cainites: Cainan, Mahalael, Jared, and <a href="../cathen/10048b.htm">Mathusala</a>, and two, Henoch and Lamech, are identical in both pedigrees. Ada probably means "dawn", Sella, "shade", Jabel, "shepherd", Jubal, "musician". Noemi means "beautiful". The <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> omits Cain after Jubal, thereby suggesting connection with a tribe of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> (<a href="../bible/gen010.htm#vrs2">Genesis 10:2</a>, <a href="../bible/eze027.htm#vrs13">Ezekiel 27:13</a>) called Tabalu by <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> and <em>Tybarenoi</em> by Herodotus. But the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> <em>Tubalcain</em> is certainly correct if it be connected with Balgin, the Sumerian Vulcan, as recently suggested. If we substitute English equivalents for proper names, <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs19">Genesis 4:19-22</a> would read: "God's servant took two wives, the name of the one was Dawn and the name of the other Shade. And Dawn brought forth Shepherd, the father of dwellers in tents and herdsmen and his brother's name was Musician, the father of harp- and pipe-players. But Shade brought forth Blacksmith, the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> of brass and iron, and Blacksmith's sister's name was Beautiful." This has led some to believe that the <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> narrative merely records under a figure of speech the introduction of polygamy and the spread of civilization.

<p>A similar description existed amongst <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a>. As the most recent research has shown that iron was used in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> 3500 B.C., no argument for lateness of narrative can be drawn from the mention of iron. As for the six lines of <a href="../cathen/12174b.htm">Hebrew poetry</a> (verses 23-24) put into the mouth of Lemach, though their origin and occasion will probably remain forever obscure, their general meaning is clear: <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a> had committed deliberate <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, fratricide, yet he was not handed over to the lawless private vengeance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. How much less was Lamech, in self-defence, i.e. slain a man for wounding him, or, in <a href="../cathen/11473a.htm">Hebrew parallelism</a>, for bruising him. In <a href="../bible/num024.htm#vrs22">Numbers 24:22</a>, <a href="../bible/jdg004.htm#vrs11">Judges 4:11</a>, <a href="../bible/1ch002.htm#vrs55">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>, Cinites are mentioned as neighbours to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. The Hebrew consonants would allow the reading <em>Cainites</em>, which some scholars have adopted against the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massora</a> and <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>; but this is at present mere conjecture.
<h2 id="section2">Sect of Gnostics and Antinomians</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the second century was called Cainites or Caianites. They regarded all characters held up to reprobation in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> as worthy of <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a>, as having suffered at the hands of the cruel <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; hence <a href="../cathen/03142b.htm">Cain</a>, as the first man <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a> by Hysteraa, the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurg</a>, claimed their special admiration. This <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">Antinomians</a> never found many adherents, and <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> at the beginning of the third century dismisses them with the bare mention of their name. (See <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">GNOSTICISM</a>.)
