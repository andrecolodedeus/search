<h1>Caius Marius Victorinus</h1>  

<p>(Called also VICTORINUS MARIUS, or MARIUS FABIUS VICTORINUS, and frequently referred to as VICTORINUS AFER.)

<p>A fourth-century grammarian, rhetorician, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. in Africa about the year 300. In pursuance of his profession as teacher of rhetoric he migrated to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he attained such fame and popularity that in 353 a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> was erected in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the Forum of Trajan (Jerome, "Chron." ad an. 2370). Details regarding his life come almost entirely from Jerome or Augustine, the latter of whom calls him a man of the highest learning and thoroughly skilled in the liberal arts. In addition to his activities as a teacher he was a copious author and wrote or translated many works. Three works written before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> still exist: "Liber de Definitionibus"; a commentary on the "De inventione" of Cicero; and a treatise on grammar, "Ars grammatica". Works from the same period which have perished are: a treatise on <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, "De syllogismis hypotheticis"; commentaries on the "Topica" and the "Dialogues" of Cicero; a translation and commentary of Artistotle's "Categories"; a translation of the same author's "Interpretation"; translations of Porphyry's "Isagoge", and works of other <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonists</a>. The conversion of Victorinus, which took place before 361, was brought about, according to Augustine, through study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. A seeming reluctance at first to enroll himself in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community was compensated for afterwards by his insistence on making his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as publicly as possible. His accession to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which was received with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, did not cause Victorinus to abandon his profession, and he continued to teach until the edict of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> in 362, closing the teaching profession to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to retire.

<p>Nothing more is known of his subsequent career except what can be gleaned from his writings. The range and fulness of these manifest his diligence and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in defence of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Most of the writings of his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> days have perished. Those which survive are an anti-Arian treatise, "Liber de generatione divini Verbi"; a work "Adversus Arium" in four books, a tract "De Hoimoousio Recipiendo"; three <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> "De Trinitate"; commentaries on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, and to the Philippians. Other works of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity are "Liber ad Justinum manichaeum"; "De verbis scripturae: Factum est vespere et mane dies unus"; "Liber de physicis". Many references in his own writings show that Victorinus was the author of many other works of a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a>, or polemical character. He is also credited with the translation of some of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> works and the authorship of other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. Though a man of varied books and great erudition Victorinus is little studied. This neglect is largely attributed to the fact that his style is obscure and burdensome in the extreme. Recent study of his works tends to enhance his position in the history of pedagogy, letters, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and above all as a potent influence in disseminating <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonic</a> doctrines in the West.
