<h1>Caius and Soter, Saints and Popes</h1>  

<p>They have their feast together on 22 April, on which day they appear in most of the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>, though <a href="../cathen/11125b.htm">Notker</a> and a few others give Soter on the 21st and Caius on the 19th or 21st.

<p>Soter was <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for eight years, c. 167 to 175 (Harnack prefers 166-174). We possess a fragment of an interesting letter addressed to him by St. Dionysius of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, who writes: "From the beginning it has been your custom to do good to all the brethren in many ways, and to send <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> in every city, refreshing the poverty of those who sent requests, or giving aid to the brethren in the mines, by the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> which you have had the habit of giving from old, Romans keeping up the traditional custom of the Romans; which your blessed Bishop Soter has not only preserved, but has even increased, by providing the abundance which he has sent to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and by further consoling with blessed words with brethren who came to him, as a loving father his children." "Today, therefore, we have kept the holy Lord's day, on which we have read your letter, which we shall always have to read and be admonished, even as the former letter which was written to us by the ministry of Clement." (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.24</a>) The letter which Soter had written in the name of his church is lost, though Harnack and others have attempted to identify it with the so-called <a href="../fathers/1011.htm">"Second Epistle of Clement"</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">CLEMENT OF ROME</a>). The reverence for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> paternal letter is to be noticed. The traditional generosity of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> is again referred to by <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">St. Dionysius of Alexandria</a> to Pope Dionysius in the middle of the third century, and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> says it still continued in his time. Nothing further is known of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>Caius was <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for twelve years, four months, and seven days, from 17 December, 283, to 22 April, 296, according to the Liberian catalogue (Harnack, Chronol., I, 155, after Lipsius and Lightfoot); <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> is wrong in giving him fifteen years. He is mentioned in the fourth-century "Depositio Episcoporum" (therefore not as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>): <em>X kl maii Caii in Callisti.</em> He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in that cemetary. Nothing whatever is known of his life. He lived in the time of peace before the last great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">Soter is said by the fifth-century writer known as PR&AElig;DESTINATUS (c. xxvi) to have written a book against the Montanists; he adds that Tertullian wrote against Pope Soter and Apollonius. As we know (JEROME, <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 40</a>) that Tertullian wrote against Apollonius in his lost De Ecstasi, this may be true; see HARNACK, Gesch. der altchristlich. Lit., I, 589; ZAHN, Forschungen (1893), V, 49. On Caius in later Acts of Saints see TILLEMONT, IV; Acta SS., 14 April; BECILLUS, Acta S. Caii P. et M. (Rome, 1628). The false decretals attributed to these two popes will be found in the collections of councils, in COUSTANT, MIGNE, HINSCHIUS, etc. On a lette attributed to Caius by the Malabar Christians, see ROUTH, Reliq. Sacrae, II, 158, and HARNACK, op. cit., 777.</p></div>
