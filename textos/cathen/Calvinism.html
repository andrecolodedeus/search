<h1>Calvinism</h1>  

<p>No better account of this remarkable (though now largely obsolete) system has been drawn out than M&ouml;hler's in his "Symbolism or Doctrinal Differences." The "Institutes of the Christian Religion," in which <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> depicted his own mind, were never superseded by creed or formulary, though the writer subscribed, in 1540, at Worms to the Confession of Augsburg, i.e. the second revised edition. To take his bearings in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> we must remember that he succeeded <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in point of time and was committed to a struggle with <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli's</a> disciples at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> and elsewhere, known as Sacramentarians, but who tended more and more towards a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> without mysteries. In 1549 he and Farel entered with Bullinger into a moderate view as regarded the Eucharist, the "Consensus Tigurinus," or compact of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, which <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a> also accepted. Another compact, of the "pastors of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>" strengthened his hands, in 1552, on the subjects of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, against <a href="../cathen/02643a.htm">Jerome Bolsec</a>, whom he refuted and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. <a href="../cathen/02643a.htm">Bolsec</a> finally returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1553 a controversy between the German <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> about the Lord's Supper led <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> to declare his agreement with <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> (the Philippists), but <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> kept silence. Further complications ensued when Beza, softening the real <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, drew nearer still to the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> on this head. Bullinger and Peter Martyr cried down Beza's unauthorized glosses; but <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> supported his favourite. Nevertheless, that "declaration" was dropped by Beza when, in company with Farel, he put together a "Confession of the French Church," and fell back on the creed of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> issued in 1530, while not assenting to its 10th article. The Eucharist was to be more than a sign; Christ was truly present in it, and was received by Faith (compare the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> Book, which reproduces his conception). Beyond these, on the whole, abortive efforts toward a common understanding, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> never went. His individual genius demanded its own expression; and he is always like himself, unlike any other. The many creeds fell into oblivion; but the "Institutes" were recognized more and more as the sum of Reformed Theology. It was said after 1560, by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> St. Peter Canisius, that <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> appeared to be taking <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> place even among Germans. Three currents have ever since held their course in this development of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>: <ul><li>the mystic, derived from <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>-orthodox, from <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>; and <li>the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodox</a>-<a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a>, from <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> (Zwingli), this last being greatly increased, thanks to the <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarians</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Ochino, Fausto, and <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Lelio Socino</a>.</ul> To the modern world, however, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> stands peculiarly for the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is supposed to contain the essence of the Gospel; and multitudes who reject <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> mean merely the creed of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>.

<p>Why does this happen? Because, we answer, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> gave himself out as following closely in the steps of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> he judged to be <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semi-Pelagian</a>, a stigma which his disciples fix especially on the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, above all, on Molina. Hence the curious situation arises, that, while the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> consent of the East and West finds little or no acknowledgement as an historical fact among assailants of religion, the views which a single Reformer enunciated are taken as though representing the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. In other words, a highly refined individual system, not traceable as a whole to any previous age, supplants the public teaching of centuries. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, comes before us, as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had already done, in the shape of a <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a>. His "pure <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>" is gained by appealing, not to tradition, the "deposit" of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but to argument in abstract terms exercised upon Scripture. He is neither a critic nor a historian; he takes the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as something given; and he manipulates the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> in accordance with his own <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The "Institutes" are not a history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, but a treatise, only not to be called an essay because of its peremptory tone. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> annihilates the entire space, with all its developments, which lies between the death of St. John and the sixteenth century. He does, indeed, quote St. Augustine, but he leaves out all that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> foundation on which the Doctor of Grace built.

<p>The "Institutes of the Christian Religion" are divided into four books and exhibit a commentary on the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>. <ul><li>Book I considers <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Creator</a>, the Trinity, revelation, man's first estate and original righteousness. <li>Book II describes the Fall of Adam, and treats of Christ the Redeemer. <li>Book III enlarges on justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, election, and reprobation. <li>Book IV gives the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</ul> In form the work differs from the "Summa" of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> by using exposition where the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a> syllogizes; but the style is close, the language good Latin of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, and the tone elevated, though often bitter. Arguments employed are always ostensibly grounded on Scripture, the authority of which rests not upon fallible human reasoning, but on the internal persuasion of the Holy Spirit. Yet <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> is embarrassed at the outset by "unsteady men" who declare themselves enlightened of the same spirit and in no want of Scripture. He endeavours to refute them by the instance of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and other "primitive believers," i.e. after all, by <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a>. It will be obvious, moreover, that where the "Institutes" affirm <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> tenets they follow the Councils and the Fathers, while professing reliance on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> alone. Thus we need not rehearse those chapters which deal with the Nicene and Chalcedonian formulas.



<p>We shall best apprehend <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> master-thought if we liken it to modern systems of the Unconscious, or of physical predetermination, wherein all effects lie folded up, as it were, in one First Cause, and their development in time is necessitated. Effects are thus mere manifestations, not fresh acts, or in any way due to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> choosing its own course. Nature, grace, revelation, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a> do but show us different aspects of the eternal energy which works in all things. There is no <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> outside the Supreme. <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> argued that, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> being, He alone existed &#151; there could be no other being, and secondary or created causes were but instruments moved entirely by Divine power. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> did not go to this length. But he denies freedom to creatures, fallen or unfallen, except it be <em>libertas a coactione</em>; in other words, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not compel man to act by brute force, yet he determines irresistibly all we do, whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The Supreme is indeed self-conscious &#151; not a blind Fate or <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> destiny; it is by "decree" of the sovereign Lawgiver that events come to pass. But for such decrees no reason can be rendered. There is not any cause of the Divine will save Itself. If we ask why has the Almighty acted thus and thus, we are told, "Quia ipse voluit" &#151; it is His good pleasure. Beyond this, an explanation would be impossible, and to demand one is impiety. From the human angle of sight, therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works as though without a reason. And here we come upon the primal mystery to which in his argument <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> recurs again and again. This Supreme Will fixes an absolute order, physical, <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a>, religious, never to be modified by anything we can attempt. For we cannot act upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, else He would cease to be the First Cause. Holding this clue, it is comparatively simple to trace <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> footsteps along the paths of history and revelation.

<p><a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had written that man's will is enslaved either to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, but it is never free. <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> declaimed against the "impious <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of Free Will," adding that since all things happen by necessity according to <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">Divine predestination</a>, no room was left for it. This was truly the article by which the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> should stand or fall. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is sole agent. Therefore creation, <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, election, reprobation are in such sense His acts that man becomes merely their vehicle and himself does nothing. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, contending with <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, declares that "God by an unchangeable, eternal, infallible will, foresees purposes and effects all things. By this thunderbolt Free Will is utterly destroyed." <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> shared <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of necessity to the full; but he embroiled the language by admitting in unfallen Adam a liberty of choice. He was likewise at pains to distinguish between his own teaching and the "nature bound fast in Fate" of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>. He meant by liberty, however, the absence of constraint; and the Divine wisdom which he invoked could never be made intelligible to our understanding. What he rejected was the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> notion of the self-determining second cause. Neither would he allow the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> laid down by the Fathers of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> (Sess. VI Canon 16), that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> permits <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deeds, but is not their author. The condemnation struck expressly at <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, who asserted that the betrayal by <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> was not less properly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> act than the vocation of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. But by parity of reasoning it falls upon Calvinism. For the "Institutes" affirm that "man by the righteous impulsion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does that which is unlawful," and that "man falls, the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence of God</a> so ordaining" (IV, 18, 2; III, 23, 8). Yet elsewhere <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> denied this impulse as not in accordance with the known will of the Almighty. Both he and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> found a way of escape from the moral dilemma inflicted on them by distinguishing two wills in the Divine Nature, one public or apparent, which commanded good and forbade <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as the Scripture teaches, the other just, but secret and unsearchable, predetermining that Adam and all the reprobate should fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and perish. At no time did <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> grant that Adam's transgression was due to his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Beza traces it to a spontaneous, i.e. a natural and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, movement of the spirit, in which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> could not fail to spring up. He justifies the means &#151; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its consequences &#151; by the holy purpose of the Creator who, if there were no one to punish, would be incapable of showing that he is a righteously vindictive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As, however, man's intent was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he becomes a sinner while his Creator remains holy. The Reformed confessions will not allow that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> &#151; and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> shows deep indignation when charged with "this disgraceful falsehood." He distinguishes, like Beza, the various intentions concurring to the same act on the part of different agents- but the difficulty cannot well be got over, that, in his view, the First Cause alone is a real agent, and the rest mere instruments. It was objected to him that he gave no convincing reasons for the position thus taken up, and that his followers were swayed by their master's authority rather than by the force of his <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>. Even an admirer, J. A. Froude, tells us: <blockquote>To represent man as sent into the world under a curse, as incurably wicked&mdash;wicked by the constitution of his nature and wicked by eternal decree&mdash;as doomed, unless exempted by special grace which he cannot merit, or by any effort of his own obtain, to live in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> while he remains on earth, and to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> miserable when he leaves it&mdash;to represent him as born unable to keep the commandments, yet as justly liable to everlasting punishment for breaking them, is alike repugnant to reason and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and turns existence into a hideous nightmare. (Short Studies, II, 3.)</blockquote>

<p>Another way to define the Reformed <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> would be to contrast its view of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> eternal decrees with that taken in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, notably by <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> authors such as Molina. To <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> the ordinances of Deity seemed absolute, i.e. not in any way regardful of the creature's acts, which they predetermined either right or wrong; and thus reprobation &#151; the supreme issue between all parties &#151; followed upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> unconditioned fiat, no account being had in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> itself of man's merits or demerits. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> chose some to glory and others to shame everlasting as He willed, not upon foreknowledge how they would act. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> made foreknowledge of "future contingencies" or of what creatures would do in any possible juncture, the term of Divine vision <em>"scientia media"</em> which was <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> antecedent (as a condition not a cause) to the scheme of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Grace, said <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, was offered to all men; none were excluded from it. Adam need not have transgressed, neither was his fall pre-ordained. Christ died for the whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>; and every one had such help from on high that the reprobate could never charge their ruin upon their Maker, since he permitted it only, without an absolute <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. Grace, then, was given freely; but eternal life came to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> by merit, founded on correspondence to the Holy Spirit's impulse. All these statements <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> rejected as <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a>, except that he would maintain, though unable to justify, the imputation of the sinner's lapse to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by itself.

<p>To be consistent, this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> requires that no prevision of Adam's Fall should affect the eternal choice which discriminates between the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> and the lost. A genuine Calvinist ought to be a supralapsarian; in other terms, the Fall was decreed as means to an end; it did not first appear in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sight to be the sufficient cause why, if He chose, He might select some from the <em>"massa damnata,"</em> leaving others to their decreed doom. To this subject <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> frequently returns in his anti-Pelagian treatises, and he lays great emphasis on the consequences to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> as regards their final state, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> dealing with them in fallen Adam. But his language, unlike that of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, never implies absolute rejection <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> from foreknowledge of man's guilt. Thus even to the African Father, whose views in his latter works became increasingly severe (see "On the Predestination of the Saints" and "On Correction and Grace") there was always an element of <em>scientia media</em>, i.e. prevision in the relation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with His creatures. But, to the Reformer who explained Redemption and its opposite by sheer <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> doing as it would, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that man could, even as a term of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by his free acts be considered in the Everlasting Will was not conceivable. As the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> said, "How can the Eternal be begotten?" and straightway denied the generation of the Word, in like manner <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, "How can the contingent affect the First Cause on which it utterly depends?" In the old dilemma, "either <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> or man is not self determined," the "Institutes" accept the conclusion adverse to liberty. But it was, said <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, equally adverse to <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>; and the system has always been criticised on that ground. In a word, it seemed to be <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">antinomian</a>.

<p>With Augustine the Geneva author professed to be at one. "If they have all been taken from a corrupt mass," he argued, "no marvel that they are subject to condemnation." But, his critics replied, "were they not antecedently <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to that corruption?" And "is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> in treating His creatures with such cruel mystery?" To this <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> answers, "I confess that all descendants of Adam fell by the Divine will," and that "we must return at last to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sovereign determination, the cause of which is hidden" (Institutes, III, 23, 4). "Therefore," he concludes, "some men are born devoted from the womb to certain death, that His name may be glorified in their destruction." And the reason why such necessity is laid upon them? "Because," says <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> "life and death are acts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will rather than of his foreknowledge," and "He foresees further events only in consequence of his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> that they shall happen." Finally, "it is an awful <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, I confess [<em>horribile decretum, fateor</em>], but none can deny that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknew the future final fate of man before He created him &#151; and that He did foreknow it because it was appointed by His own ordinance." <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, then, is a supralapsarian; the Fall was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; and our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a>, like ourselves, could not have avoided <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>.

<p>So far, the scheme presents a cast-iron <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> at whatever expense to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and morality. When it comes to consider <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, its terms sound more uncertain, it veers to each extreme in succession of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, that nature is almost always viewed historically, not in the abstract hence as possessed by unfallen Adam it was endowed with <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a>, while in his fallen children it bears the burden of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the French Reformer, not conceding a possible state of pure nature, attributes to the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>, with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> (in <a href="../bible/gen003.htm">Genesis 3</a>), such perfection as would render <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">God's actual grace</a> unnecessary, thus tending to make Adam self-sufficient, as the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> held all men to be. On the other hand, when <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> took them once captive the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was entirety blotted out. This article of "total depravity" also came from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, who expressed it in language of appalling power. And so the "Institutes" announce that "in man all which bears reference to the blessed life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is extinct." And if it was "natural" in Adam to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or a part of his very essence, then by lapsing from grace he would have been plunged into an abyss below nature, where his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> moral and religious being was altogether dissolved. So, at any rate, the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> believed in their earlier period, nor was <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> reluctant to echo them.

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> distinguish two kinds of beatitude: one corresponding to our nature as a rational species and to be acquired by virtuous acts; the other beyond all that man may do or seek when left to his own faculties, and in such wise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> free gift that it is due only to acts performed under the influence of a strictly <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> movement. The confusion of grace with nature in Adam's essence was common to all the Reformed <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; it is peculiarly manifest in <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, who strove to deduce it from <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. And, granting the Fall, it leads by direct inference to man's utter corruption as the unregenerate child of Adam. He is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in all that he thinks, or wills, or does. Yet <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> allows him reason and choice, though not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> liberty. The heart was poisoned by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but something remained of grace to hinder its worst excesses, or to justify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> vengeance on the reprobate (over and above their original fault inherited). On the whole, it must be said that the "Institutes" which now and then allow that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> image was not quite effaced in us, deny to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, so far as <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> has not touched them, any moral and religious powers whatsoever. With <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> as with his predecessor of <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> virtue is but apparent, and that of the non-Christian merely "political," or secular. Civilization, founded on our common nature, is in such a view external only, and its <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or benevolence may claim no intrinsic value. That it has no <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> value <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have always asserted; but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> condemns those who say, with <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>, "All the works of unbelievers are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and the virtues of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are vices." Propositions equivalent to these are as follows: "Free Will not aided by <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">God's grace</a>, avails only to commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," and "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could not have created man at the beginning such as he is now born" (Props. 25, 27, 55, censured by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>, Oct., 1567, and by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, March, 1641). <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> admits a twofold <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and righteousness &#151; the one natural, as <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> defines it in his "Ethics," the other <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> inspired by the Holy Ghost. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> throws aside every middle term between justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and corrupt desire. The integrity of Adam's nature once violated, he falls under the dominion of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which reigns in him without hindrance, save by the external grace now and again preventing a deeper degradation. But whatever he is or does savours of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>. Accordingly the system maintained that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (which here signifies trust in the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> sense) was the first interior grace given and source of all others, as likewise that outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> no grace is ever bestowed.

<p>We come on these lines to the famous distinction which separates the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church that of the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a>, from the seeming or visible, where all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> meet. This falls in with <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> whole theory, but is never to be mistaken for the view held by Roman authorities, that some may pertain to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who are not members of its body. Always pursuing his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, the absolute <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">predestinarian</a> finds among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, all of whom have heard the Gospel and received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, only a few entitled to life everlasting. These obtain the grace which is in words offered to every one; the rest fill up the measure of their condemnation. To the reprobate, Gospel ordinances serve as a means to compass the ruin intended for them. Hereby, also, an answer is made possible when <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> demand where the Reformed Church was prior to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> replies that in every age the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> constituted the flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and all besides were strangers, though invested with dignity and offices in the visible communion. The reprobate have only apparent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Yet they may feel as do the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, experience similar fervours, and to the best of their judgment be accounted <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. All that is mere delusion; they are <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> "into whose minds <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> insinuates Himself, so that, not having the adoption of sons, they may yet taste the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the Spirit." Thus <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> explained how in the Gospel many are called believers who did not persevere; and so the visible Church is made up of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that can never lose their crown, and sinners that by no effort could attain to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p>Faith, which means assurance of election, grace, and glory, is then the heritage of none but the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a>. But, since no real secondary cause exists man remains passive throughout the temporal series of events by which he is shown to be an adopted <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>. He neither acts nor, in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense co-operates with his Redeemer. A difference in the method of conversion between <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> may here be noted. The German mystic begins, as his own experience taught him, with the terrors of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The French divine who had never gone through that stage, gives the first place to the Gospel; and repentance, instead of preceding <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, comes after it. He argued that by so disposing of the process, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> appeared manifestly alone, unaccompanied by repentance, which, otherwise, might claim some share of merit. The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, moreover, did not allow absolute <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. And their confidence in being themselves justified, i.e. saved, was unequal to <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> requirements. For he made assurance inevitable as was its object to the chosen <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Nevertheless, he fancied that between himself and the sounder <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> scholastics no quarrel need arise touching the principle of justification &#151; namely, that "the sinner being delivered gratuitously from his doom becomes righteous." <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> overlooked in these statements the vital difference which accounts for his aberration from the ancient system. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> held that fallen man kept in some degree his moral and religious faculties, though much impaired, and did not lose his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. But the newer <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> affirmed man's total incompetence, he could neither freely consent nor ever resist, when grace was given, if he happened to be <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a>. If not, justification lay beyond his grasp. However, the language of the "Institutes" is not so uncompromising as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> had been. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> first heals the corrupt will, and the will follows His guidance; or, we may say, cooperates.

<p>The one final position of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> is that <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> grace of itself substitutes a good for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will in the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, who do nothing towards their own conversion but when converted are accounted just. In all the original <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> righteousness is something imputed, not indwelling in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It is a legal fiction when compared with what the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> believes, namely, that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or sanctification involves a real gift, a quality bestowed on the spirit and inherent, whereby it becomes the thing it is called. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declares (Sess. VI) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for all men, it condemns (Canon XVII) the main propositions of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, that "the grace of justification comes only to the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a>," and that "the others who are called receive an invitation but no grace, being doomed by the Divine power to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." So <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> proscribed in <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> the statement: "It is <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semipelagian</a> to affirm that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for all men, or shed His blood in their behalf." In like manner <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> rejected the definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as "confidence in being justified without merit"; grace was not "the feeling of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>," nor was justification the "forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," and apart from a special revelation no man could be infallibly sure that he was saved. According to <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was made such by his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the sinner by want of it stood condemned, but the Fathers of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> distinguished a dead <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which could never justify, from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> animated by charity &#151; and they attributed merit to all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> done through <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Divine inspiration</a>. But in the Genevese <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself is not holy. This appears very singular; and no explanation has ever been vouchsafed of the power ascribed to an act or mean, itself destitute of intrinsic qualities, neither morally good nor in any way meritorious, the presence or absence of which nevertheless fixes our eternal destiny

<p>But since Christ alone is our righteousness, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> concluded that the just man is never just in himself; that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, though resisted, makes him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> damnably in all he does, and that he remains a sinner until his last breath. Thus even the "Solid Declaration" teaches, though in many respects toning down the Reformer's truculence. Such guilt, however, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> overlooks where <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is found &#151; the one unpardonable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. "Pecca fortiter sed crede fortius" &#151; this <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> epigram, "Sin as you like provided you believe," expresses in a paradox the contrast between corrupt <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, filthy still in the very highest <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and the shadow of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as, falling upon them, it hides their shame before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Here again the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> refuses to consider man responsible except where his will consents; the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> regards impulse and enticement as constituting all the will that we have. These observations apply to <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> &#151; but he avoids extravagant speech while not differing from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in fact. He grants that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> would not term involuntary desires <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; then he adds, "We, on the contrary, deem it to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whenever a man feels any desires forbidden by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> &#151; and we assert the depravity to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which produces them" (Institutes, III, 2, 10). On the hypothesis of determinism, held by every <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, this <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> is unimpeachable. But it leads to strange consequences. The sinner commits actions which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> may also indulge in; but one is saved the other is lost; and so the entire moral contents of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> are emptied out. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> denominated the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> liberty freedom from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. And <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, "The question is not how we can be righteous, but how, though unworthy and unrighteous, we may be considered righteous." The law may instruct and exhort, but "it has no place in the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> tribunal." And if <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> advert to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, "they see that every work they attempt or <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">meditate</a> is accursed" (Institutes, III, 19, 2, 4). <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> had condemned <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> thesis, "In every good work the just man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> fell under censure for asserting (Props. 74, 75) that "concupiscence in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, though not imputed." And, viewing the whole theory, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have asked whether a sinfulness which exists quite independent of the will is not something substantial, like the darkness of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, or essential to us who are finite beings.

<p>At all events <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> seems entangled in perplexities on the subject, for he declares expressly that the regenerate are "liable every moment at <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> judgment-seat to sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>" (Instit., III, 2, 11); yet elsewhere he tempers his language with a "so to speak," and explains it as meaning that all human virtue is imperfect. He would certainly have subscribed to the "Solid Declaration," that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> are not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. With <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, he affirms the least transgression to be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even involuntary <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> &#151; and as this abides in every man while he lives, all that we do is worthy of punishment (Instit., II, 8, 68, 59). And again, "There never yet was any work of a religious man which, examined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> severe standard would not be condemnable" (Ibid., III, 14,11). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> had already censured these axioms by asserting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not command impossibilities, and that His children keep His word. <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> did the like when he proscribed as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> the fifth proposition of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, "Some <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments of God</a> are impossible to the just who will and endeavour; nor is the grace by which they should become possible given to them."

<p>Two important practical consequences may be drawn from this entire view: first, that conversion takes place in a moment &#151; and so all evangelical <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> believe; and, second, that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> ought not to be administered to infants, seeing they cannot have the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which justifies. This latter inference produced the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> against whom <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> thunders as he does, against other "frenzied" <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, in vehement tones. Infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was admitted, but its value, as that of every ordinance, varied with the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to life or to death of the recipient. To Calvinists the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> system was an outward life beneath which the Holy Spirit might be present or absent, not according to the dispositions brought by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but as grace was decreed. For <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> could not prepare a man to receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> worthily any more than to be justified in the beginning. If so, the <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quakers</a> might well ask, what is the use of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> when we have the Spirit? And especially did this reasoning affect the Eucharist. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> employs the most painful terms in disowning the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a>. No longer channels of grace, to <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are "Memorials of the exercise of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," or badges to be used by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. From this point of view, <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Christ's real presence</a> was superfluous, and the acute mind of <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> leaped at once to that conclusion, which has ever since prevailed among ordinary <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> adherence to the words of the Scripture forbade him to give up the reality, though he dealt with it in his peculiar fashion. <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a> held an obscure <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which attempted the middle way between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>. To <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> serve as tokens of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> degrades them to covenants between the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> gives the old scholastic definition and agrees with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in commending their use, but he separates the visible element proffered to all from the grace which none save the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> may enjoy. He admits only two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, Baptism and the Lord's Supper. Even these neither contain nor confer spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>; they are signs, but not efficacious as regards that which is denoted by them. For inward gifts, we must remember, do not belong to the system, whereas <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in ordinances as acts of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Man-God</a>, producing the effects within the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which He has promised, "He that eateth Me shall live by Me."

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> tradition was thrown aside, differences touching the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> sprang up immediately among the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> which have never found a reconciliation. To narrate their history would occupy a volume. It is notable, however, that <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> succeeded where <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a> had failed, in a sort of compromise, and the agreement of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> which he inspired was taken up by the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Elsewhere it led to quarrels, particularly among the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, who charged him with yielding too much. He taught that the Body of Christ is truly present in the Eucharist, and that the believer partakes of it that the elements are unchanged, and that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Mass was <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Yet his precise meaning is open to question. That he did not hold a real objective presence seems clear from his arguing against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, as the "black <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a>" of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Common Prayer Book</a> argues &#151; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, he says, is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Therefore, it cannot be on earth. The reception was a spiritual one; and this perfectly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> phrase might be interpreted as denying a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> corporal presence. The Augsburg Confession, revised by its author <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, favoured ambiguous views &#151; at last he declared boldly for <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, which amounted to an acknowledgment that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> more decided language overshot the mark. The "Formula of Concord" was an attempt to rescue German Churches from this concession to the so-called Sacramentarians; it pronounced, as <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> never would have done, that the unworthy communicant receives <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Our Lord's Body</a>; and it met his objection by the strange device of "ubiquity" &#151; namely, that the glorified Christ was everywhere. But these quarrels lie outside our immediate scope.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> would not grant the Mass to be a sacrifice, nor the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the Lord's Supper to be <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that conception of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which history traces back to the earliest Apostolic times underwent a corresponding change. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were now "Ministers of the Word," and the Word was not a tradition, comprising Scripture in its treasury, but the printed Bible, declared all-sufficient to the mind which the Spirit was guiding. Justification by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> only, as the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> &#151; such were the cardinal principles of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. They worked at first destructively, by abolishing the Mass and setting up private judgment in opposition to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Then the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> arose. If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word sufficed, what need of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>? The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> felt that they must restore creeds and enforce the power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> over dissidents. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, who possessed great constructive talent, built his presbytery on a democratic foundation &#151; the people were to choose, but the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> chosen were to rule. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> freedom consisted in throwing off the yoke of the Papacy, it did not allow the individual to stand aloof from the congregation. He must sign formulas, submit to discipline, be governed by a committee of elders. A new sort of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> came into view, professing that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was its teacher and judge, but never letting its members think otherwise than the articles drawn up should enjoin. None were allowed in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> who were not publicly called, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, which <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> regarded almost as a sacrament, was conferred by the presbytery.

<p>In his Fourth Book the great <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclast</a>, to whom in good <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> only the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> invisible should have signified anything, makes the visible Church supreme over <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, assigns to it the prerogatives claimed by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, enlarges on the guilt of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and upholds the principle, <em>Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus</em>. He will not allow that corrupt <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or a passing eclipse of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> by <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, can excuse those who, on pretence of a purer Gospel, leave it. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is described in equivalent terms as indefectible and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>. All are bound to hear and obey what it teaches. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had spoken of it with contempt almost everywhere in his first writings; to him the individual guided by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was autonomous. But <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> taught his followers so imposing a conception of the body in which they were united as to bring back a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in effect if not in name. "Where the ministry of Word and Sacraments is preserved," he concludes, "no moral delinquencies can take away the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> title." He had nevertheless, broken with the communion in which he was born. The <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> retorted that they did not owe to his new-fashioned presbytery the allegiance he had cast away &#151; the <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quakers</a>, who held with him by the Inward Light, more consistently refused all <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to the visible Church.

<p>One sweeping consequence of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> is yet to be noticed. As it denied the merit of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> even in the regenerate, all those <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and ordinances which implied a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Communion of Saints</a> actively helping each other by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and self-sacrifice were flung aside. Thus <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, Masses for the dead, invocation of the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and their intercession for us are scouted by <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> as "Satan's devices." A single argument gets rid of them all: do they not make void the Cross of Christ our only Redeemer? (Instit., III, 5, 6). Beza declared that "prayer to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> destroys the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Calvinists affirmed of them, as the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> of their <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>, that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing about what passes on earth. Wherever the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> triumphed, a wholesale destruction of shrines and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> took place. Monasticism, being an ordered system of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles, offended all who thought such works needless or even dangerous &#151; it fell, and great was the fall thereof, in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The Calendar had been framed as a yearly ritual, commemorating <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> life and sufferings, with <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> days filling it up. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> would tolerate the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> who desired to keep the Gospel festivals; but his <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> followers left the year blank, observing only the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, in a spirit of Jewish legalism. After such a fashion the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> from the political order &#151; the living <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ceased to have any distinct relation with his departed friends; the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> became mere memories, or were suspected of Popery; the churches served as houses of preaching, where the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> had abolished the altar; and <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> was a thing of the past.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, including <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, appealed so confidently to St. Augustine's volumes that it seems only fair to note the real difference which exists between his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and theirs. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> sums it up as follows: <blockquote>The main point is whether the Moral Law can in its substance be obeyed and kept by the regenerate. Augustine says, that whereas we are by nature condemned by the Law, we are enabled by the <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">grace of God</a> to perform it unto our justification; <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> [and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> equally] that, whereas we are condemned by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, Christ has Himself performed it unto our justification &#151; Augustine, that our righteousness is active; <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, that it is passive; Augustine, that it is imparted, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> that it is only imputed; Augustine, that it consists in a change of heart; <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, in a change of state. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> maintains that <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">God's commandments</a> are impossible to man Augustine adds, impossible without His grace; <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> that the Gospel consists of promises only Augustine, that it is also a law, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, that our highest wisdom is not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Law, Augustine says instead, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and keep it &#151; <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> says, that the Law and Christ cannot dwell together in the heart. Augustine says that the Law is Christ; <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> denies and Augustine maintains that obedience is a matter of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> says that a man is made a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> not by working but by hearing; Augustine excludes those works only which are done before grace is given; <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, that our best deeds are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; Augustine, that they are really pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Lectures on Justification, ch. ii, 58).</blockquote>

<p>As, unlike the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, those Churches which looked up to <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> as their teacher did not accept one uniform standard, they fell into particular groups and had each their formulary. The three Helvetic Confessions, the Tetrapolitan, that of Basle, and that composed by Bullinger belong respectively to 1530, 1532, 1536. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> 42 Articles of 1553, composed by Cranmer and Ridley, were reduced to 39 under Elizabeth in 1562. They bear evident tokens of their Calvinistic origin, but are designedly ambiguous in terms and meaning. The <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Protestants</a>, in a Synod at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1559, framed their own articles. In 1562 those of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> accepted a profession drawn up by Guy de Bres and Saravia in French, which the Synod of Dort (1574) approved. A much more celebrated meeting was held at this place 1618-19, to adjudicate between the High Calvinists, or Supralapsarians, who held unflinchingly to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the "Institutes" touching <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and the Remonstrants who opposed them. Gomar led the former party; Arminius, though he died before the synod, in 1609, had communicated his milder views to Uytenbogart and Episcopius, hence called <a href="../cathen/01740c.htm">Arminians</a>. They objected to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of election before merit, that it made the work of Christ superfluous and inexplicable. The Five Articles which contained their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> turned on election, adoption, justification, sanctification, and sealing by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, all which Divine acts presuppose that man has been called, has obeyed, and is converted. Redemption is universal, reprobation due to the sinner's fault and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> absolute <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. In these and the like particulars, we find the <a href="../cathen/01740c.htm">Arminians</a> coming close to <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> formulas. The "Remonstrance" of 1610 embodied their protest against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, as they said, which <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> had taken under his patronage. But the Gomarists renewed his <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>; and their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> met a favourable reception among the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, French, and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the dispute underwent many vicissitudes. The <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a>, as afterwards their <a href="../cathen/11095b.htm">Nonconformist</a> descendants, generally sided with Gomar; the High Church party became <a href="../cathen/01740c.htm">Arminian</a>. Wesley abandoned the severe views of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>; Whitefield adopted them as a revelation. The Westminster Assembly (1643-47) made an attempt to unite the Churches of Great Britain on a basis of Calvinism, but in vain. Their Catechism &#151; the Larger and the Smaller &#151; enjoyed authority by Act of Parliament. <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">John Knox</a> had, in 1560 edited the "First Book of Discipline," which follows Geneva, but includes a permissive ritual. The "Second Book of Discipline" was sent out by a congregation under Andrew Melville's influence in 1572, and in 1592 the whole system received Parliamentary sanction. But James I rejected the doctrines of Dort. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the strange <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was prevalent that civil rulers ought to fix the creed of their subjects, <em>Cujus regio, ejus religio</em>. Hence an alternation and confusion of formulas ensued down to the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> in 1648. Frederick III, Count Palatine, put forward, in 1562, the Heidelberg Catechism, which is of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> inspiration. John George of Anhalt-Dessau laid down the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in 20 Articles (1597). Maurice of Hesse-Cassel patronized the Synod of Dort; and John Sigismund of Brandenburg, exchanging the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> tenets for the Genevese, imposed on his <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> the "Confession of the Marches." In general, the reformed <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> allowed dogmatic force to the revised Confession of Augsburg (1540) which <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> himself had signed.
