<h1>Camerlengo</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>camerarius</em>).

<p>The title of certain <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> officials. The Low Latin word <em>camera</em> (chamber) means the treasure of the prince, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, etc.; also in general the royal treasury (<em>fiscus</em>), the temporal administration of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The term <em>camerarius</em> was, therefore, very frequently equivalent to civil treasurer, and in the case of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> meant the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> charged with the administration of the monastic <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. This is also the sense of the Italian term <em>camerlengo</em>, still borne at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by three <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, (1) The Camerlengo of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>, (2) the Camerlengo of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College (of Cardinals)</a>, and (3) the Camerlengo of the Roman Clergy. The Roman confraternities have also an officer similarly entitled.

<h2 id="section1">The camerlengo of the holy Roman Church</h2>

<p>The Camerlengo of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a> is the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and as such is successor both of the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and of the <em>Vicedominus</em>, the former of whom administered the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the entire <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, i.e. the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, while the latter was especially charged with the administration of the <em>mensa</em> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the entire personnel of the <em>patriarchium Lateranense</em> (St. John Lateran).

<p>This latter official was the same as the syncellus at Constantinople. The office of <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was suppressed by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, himself its last incumbent under <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>; owing to its numerous ancient privileges and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> it had come to be a frequent hindrance to independent <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> action. When these were lopped off, the (Roman) office of arch-deacon shrank to its original proportions. Thereafter the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> to whom was committed the supervision of the <em>Camera Apostolica</em> (a term even then customary for the administration of the temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>) was known as <em>Camerarius</em> or, in popular language, Camerlengo. The subordinates of this official are known as clerks (<em>chierici</em>) of the Camera; chief among them are the treasurer and the auditor <em>di Camera.</em> Their body is known as <em>Reverenda Camera Apostolica</em> (see <a href="../cathen/01633b.htm">APOSTOLIC CAMERA</a>). When the cardinal-camerlengo happened to be absent on some pontifical business, a vice-camerlengo was chosen in his place. The office of camerlengo included not only the supervision of the immediate properties of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but also the fiscal administration of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, the <em>Patrimonium Petri.</em>

<p>The following were its chief attributions: <ul> <li>the collection of the <em>tax&aelig;</em>, or dues paid for the delivery of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of appointment to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> (see APOSTOLIC CHANCERY); <li>the registry of the oblations or gifts of the faithful; <li>charge of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> (<em>Moneta</em>); <li>jurisdiction, civil and criminal, over officials of the Camera (<em>chierici di Camera</em>).</ul> Under the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and their successors the office of camerlengo received more definite organization; at the same time its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> were increased. When <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> founded the Roman University (Sapienza) he decreed that the cardinal-camerlengo should be always its archchancellor. Briefly the Camerlengo of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a> was, for the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, Minister of Finance, Public Works, and Commerce. From the sixteenth century the office was purchasable from the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal</a> Government. Cardinal Cibo bought it in 1521 for 35,000 <em>scudi</em>; Cardinal Vitellozzo, under <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, for 70,000 <em>scudi</em>, and under <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> Cardinal Cornaro paid as much for the place; the revenue thus gained served to keep up the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, etc. By the Constitution "Post Diuturnos" <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> restricted greatly the authority of the camerlengo, in keeping with the thorough reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal</a> Government undertaken by him. Between the death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the election of his successor (<em>sede vacante</em>) the cardinal-camerlengo is the head of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. It is his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to verify the death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (see <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">POPE</a>), to direct the preparations for the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, and to take charge of the same.

<h2 id="section2">The camerlengo of the sacred college</h2>

<p>The Camerlengo of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College (of Cardinals)</a> does not antedate <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> (1513-21). He administers all fees and revenues belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>, pontificates at the requiem Mass for a deceased <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and is charged with the registry of the "Acta Consistoralia" (see <a href="../cathen/04285a.htm">PAPAL CONSISTORY</a>).

<h2 id="section3">The camerlengo of the Roman clergy</h2>

<p>The Camerlengo of the Roman Clergy is elected by the canons and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; he has an honorary place in the great processions, presides over the ecclesiastical conferences of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, acts as arbiter in all questions of precedence, and administers the "oath of free estate" (<em>juramentum de statu libero</em>), <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> desirous of marrying.
