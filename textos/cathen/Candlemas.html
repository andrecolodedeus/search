<h1>Candlemas</h1>  

<p><em>Also called:</em> Purification of the Blessed Virgin (Greek <em>Hypapante</em>), Feast of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. Observed 2 February in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>.

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic law</a> a mother who had given birth to a man-child was considered <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">unclean</a> for seven days; moreover she was to remain three and thirty days "in the blood of her purification"; for a maid-child the time which excluded the mother from sanctuary was even doubled. When the time (forty or eighty days) was over the mother was to "bring to the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> a lamb for a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> and a young pigeon or turtle dove for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"; if she was not able to offer a lamb, she was to take two turtle doves or two pigeons; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for her and so she was cleansed. (<a href="../bible/lev012.htm#vrs2">Leviticus 12:2-8</a>)

<p>Forty days after the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> complied with this precept of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, she redeemed her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> (<a href="../bible/num018.htm#vrs15">Numbers 18:15</a>), and was purified by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/13794c.htm">Simeon the just</a>, in the presence of Anna the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetess</a> (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs22">Luke 2:22 sqq.</a>). No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this event, the first solemn introduction of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">house of God</a>, was in the earliest times celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. We find it attested for the first half of the fourth century by the pilgrim of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, Egeria or Silvia. The day (14 February) was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> kept by a <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> to the Constantinian basilica of the Resurrection, a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on Luke 2:22 sqq., and the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. But the feast then had no proper name; it was simply called the fortieth day after <a href="../cathen/05504c.htm">Epiphany</a>. This latter circumstance proves that in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> <a href="../cathen/05504c.htm">Epiphany</a> was then the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">feast of Christ's birth</a>.

<p>From <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the feast of the fortieth day spread over the entire <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and later on was kept on the 2nd of February, since within the last twenty-five years of the fourth century the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">feast of Christ's nativity</a> (25 December) was introduced. In Antioch it is attested in 526 (Cedrenue); in the entire <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Eastern Empire</a> it was introduced by the <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian I</a> (542) in thanksgiving for the cessation of the great pestilence which had depopulated the city of Constantinople. In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> it was called <em>Hypapante tou Kyriou</em>, the meeting (<em>occursus</em>) of the Lord and His mother with <a href="../cathen/13794c.htm">Simeon</a> and Anna. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> call it: "The Coming of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>" and still keep it on the 14th of February (Tondini di Quaracchi, Calendrier de la Nation Arm&eacute;nienne, 1906, 48); the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> term it "presentation of the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>" (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, Kal. man., II 571, 643). Perhaps the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a> gave occasion also to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Roman Church</a> (to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a>?) to introduce this feast, but definite information is wanting on this point. The feast appears in the Gelasianum (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> tradition of the seventh century) under the new title of Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The precession is not mentioned. <a href="../cathen/13728b.htm">Pope Sergius I</a> (687-701) introduced a <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> for this day. The Gregorianum (tradition of the eighth century) does not speak of this <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a>, which fact proves that the <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> of <a href="../cathen/13728b.htm">Sergius</a> was the ordinary "station", not the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> act of today. The feast was certainly not introduced by <a href="../cathen/06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a> to suppress the excesses of the Lupercalia (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, Missale Gothicum, 691), and it spread slowly in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>; it is not found in the "Lectionary" of Silos (650) nor in the "Calendar" (731-741) of Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In the East it was celebrated as a feast of the Lord; in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> as a feast of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>; although the "Invitatorium" (Gaude et l&aelig;tare, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, occurrens Deo tuo), the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> and responsories remind us of its original conception as a feast of the Lord. The <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candles</a> did not enter into common use before the eleventh century; it has nothing in common with the <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> of the Pupercalia. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> this feast (<em>Purificatio</em> B.M.V.) is a double of the second class. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it had an octave in the larger number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; also today the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders whose special object is the veneration of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> (Carmelites, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>) and many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (Loreto, the Province of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, etc.) celebrate the octave.
<h2>Blessing of candles and procession</h2>

<p>According to the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> the celebrant after <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, in stole and cope of purple colour, standing at the epistle side of the altar, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candles</a> (which must be of beeswax). Having sung or recited the five orations prescribed, he sprinkles and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incenses</a> the <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candles</a>. Then he distributes them to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, whilst the choir sings the canticle of <a href="../cathen/13794c.htm">Simeon</a>, <a href="../cathen/11159a.htm">"Nunc dimittis"</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphon</a> "Lumen ad revelationem gentium et gloriam plebis tu&aelig; Israel" is repeated after every verse, according to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> custom of singing the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> which now follows, and at which all the partakers carry lighted <a href="../cathen/03246a.htm">candles</a> in their hands, the choir sings the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphon</a> "Adorna thalamum tuum, Sion", composed by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John of Damascus</a>, one of the few pieces which, text and music, have been borrowed by the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Roman Church</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greeks</a>. The other <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> are of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Roman</a> origin. The solemn <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> represents the entry of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is the Light of the World, into the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple of Jerusalem</a>. It forms an essential part of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services of the day, and must be held in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> church where the required <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> can be had. The <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> is always kept on 2 February even when the office and Mass of the feast is transferred to 3 February. Before the reform of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> liturgy by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> (1568), in the churches north and west of the Alps this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was more solemn. After the fifth oration a preface was sung. The "Adorna" was preceded by the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphon</a> "Ave Maria". While now the <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> in held inside the church, during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> left the church and visited the cemetery surrounding it. Upon the return of the <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, carrying an image of the Holy Child, met it at the door and entered the church with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who sang the canticle of Zachary, <a href="../cathen/02473a.htm">"Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel"</a>. At the conclusion, entering the sanctuary, the choir sang the <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a>, "Gaude Maria Virgo" or the prose, "Inviolata" or some other <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphon</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>.
