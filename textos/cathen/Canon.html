<h1>Canon</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical person</a> (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Canonicus</em>), a member of a <a href="../cathen/03582b.htm">chapter</a> or body of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> living according to rule and presided over by one of their number.

<p>Whether the title as applied to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is derived from <em>canon</em> (Gk. <em>kan&oacute;n</em>), a rule, or from the same term meaning a list of those who served a particular church, is much discussed. As however there are various kinds of chapters, each having its own specific rule, <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and privileges, the most accurate definition of a canon is "a member of a chapter". Some writers have derived the title from the canon or rule of community life that was followed by certain <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and which distinguished them from others who did not live in community. "A canon is so called from the canon, that is from the regularity of the life which he leads" (Scarfantoni, ed. Lucca, 1723, I, 5). Opposed to this is the opinion that canons were so called form the fact that their names were inscribed on the lists of those who served particular churches for which they were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. (For the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> use of the term see <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Ducange</a>, Glossar. med et infim&aelig; Latinitatis, s.v. Canonicus.) The latter appears to be the more <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> derivation and is in accord with the arguments of <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassinus</a> and most other writers, who agree that our present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters are the modern form of the ancient bodies of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who in each particular church formed with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the senate of that church [<a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassinus</a>, "Vetus ac nova disciplina", pt. I, bk. III, cc. vii-xi, and lxiii-lxx; <a href="../cathen/02570c.htm">Binterim</a>, "Denkw&uuml;rdigkeiten" (1826), III (2), 317-84].
<h2>Historical origin</h2>

<p>It is not possible to say exactly when canons first had recognition as a body distinct from the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (cf. Amort, Vetus disciplina canonicorum regularium et s&aelig;cularium, Venice, 1747). In the very first ages of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> there is evidence that many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> had their own proper bodies of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, although it is not so clear that these <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> kept to any common rule of life (see <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">C<font size=-2>ANONS AND</font> C<font size=-2>ANONESSES</font> R<font size=-2>EGULAR</font></a>). At the same time there were many <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who did live in common, e.g. the cenobites, and the term <em>canon</em> was applied to them as early as the fourth century; but it must not be inferred from this fact that the office of canon has its origin in those who followed the cenobitical <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">A<font size=-2>UGUSTINE,</font> R<font size=-2>ULE OF</font> S<font size=-2>AINT</font></a>). So far as the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> is concerned the first certain evidence is contained in the famous ecclesiastical constitution or ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Chrodegang, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> (763). His "Regula vit&aelig; communis" (rule of common life) was at once a restoration and an adaptation of the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, and its chief provisions were that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who adopted it had to live in common under the episcopal roof, recite common <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, perform a certain amount of manual labour, keep silence at certain times, and go to confession twice a year. They did not take the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty and they could hold a life interest in <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. For the text of the Rule of Chrodegang see <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Coll. Conc.", XIV, 313; also Walter, "Fontes Jur. eccl.", n. 6, and the edition of W. Schmitz (Hanover, 1891); cf. Ebner, in "R&ouml;m. Quartalschrift" (1891) v, 81-86. Twice a day they met to hear a chapter from the rule of their founder (see "Vita Chrodegangi", in "Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script.", X, 552), hence the meeting itself was soon called chapter (<em>capitulum</em>) and the member capitularies (<em>capitulares</em>). The canons then as now formed the council of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and assisted him in the ruling of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Those attached to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a>, being regularly models of the <em>vita canonica,</em> were soon known as <em>canonici</em> par excellence, and in time formed a special corporation, with all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> proper to such bodies. From this period dates the daily recitation by the canons of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> or <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">B<font size=-2>REVIARY</font></a>). The Councils of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> (789) and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (813) contain provisions regarding canons, and in 816 the Council of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> drew up a rule of 147 articles for the whole body of canons (Hergenr&ouml;ther-Kirsch, "Kirchengesch.", 4th ed., Freiburg, 1904, II, 170-74; Heimbucher, "Orden und Kongregationen", 2d ed., Freiburg, 1907, 3-21). In the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries, laxity crept in; community life was no longer strictly observed; the sources of revenue were divided, and the portions allocated to the individual canons. This soon led to differences of income, consequently to <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and the partial destruction of the canonical life (<em>vita canonica</em>). Various reforms were instituted by <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> (1059) and <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> (1063). There were also reforms by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> and the Council of Lateran (1139), and by <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> (1339). [On the ruin of the earlier <em>vita canonica</em> see the complaints of Anselm of Havelberg (d. 1155), in P.L., CLXXXVIII, 1083, and of <a href="../cathen/06472a.htm">Gerhoh of Reichersberg</a> (d. 169), in the fifth volume of <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze's</a> "Miscellanea", ed. Mansi (Lucca, 1761).] The development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the increase in the number of the faithful had rendered the one church of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his canons insufficient for the needs of the people; accordingly, side by side with those who followed the community life there were other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who served the filial churches and fulfilled the ordinary <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> gradually derived greater assistance from these <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the management of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and such secular coadjutors were formally constituted as canons by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. (See "Analecta Jur. Pontif.", 1863, VI, pp. 1657, 1795, 1978; "Les chap&#238;tres des cath&eacute;drales dans le Concilede Trente".) The legislation of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. V, XXII, XXIV) brought into uniformity the varying customs regarding the appointment, tenure, <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, etc., of canons; it also regulated their relations to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> administration, and wherever the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is now in full vigour the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> constitutions are observed. In countries like <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government does not conform strictly to the disciplinary decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; hence, though in such countries canons may be appointed, they have not the canonical <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> or status that belongs to a canon in the full sense of the word. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, many of the chapters were composed of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or of canons regular, but these were all secularized at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. At present the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> canons in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> have little to do with the ruling of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and their chief <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is that of residence.



<p>As canons regular became separated into different congregations they took their names from the locality in which they lived, or from the distinctive habit they wore, or from the one who led the way in remodelling their lives. Hence we have the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">White Canons of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</a>; the White Canons of St. John Lateran; the Black Canons of St. Augustine; the Canons of St. Victor at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and also at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> (Muratori, "Diss.de Canonicis", in "Antiq. Ital. medii &aelig;vi", V, 163; G. Pennoti, "Gen. hist. totius s. ord. clericor. canonicorum", Rome, 1624; Ginzel, "Die canonische Lebensweise der Geistlichen", Ratisbon, 1851).
<h2>Kinds of canons</h2>

<p>Canons are divided in the following manner: (1) Cathedral canons, who, attached to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, form the senate or council of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; collegiate canons, who perform the canonical office in the church to which they are attached, but are not connected by reason of their office with the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. (2) Prebendary canons, who have a <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a> or fixed income attached to the canonry; simple canons, who have no <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a>. (3) Canons <em>de numero,</em> i.e. those of a church the number of whose canons can neither be diminished nor increased; (4) supernumerary canons, who are assistants to the canons <em>de numero</em>. The supernumerary canons are subdivided into three classes, viz. (a) those whom the Holy Father appoints and who will receive the first vacant <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a> (expectant canons); (b) honorary canons (for these see the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> "Illud est proprium", 21 Jan., 1894, and the recent <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Congr. of Rites, 14 Nov., 1902), and (c) canons who are added on the founding of a new <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a>. Formerly the chief distinction was that made between the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> canons. Regular canons, as forming the council of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, are now almost obsolete, and the special regulations by which they are bound, their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, privileges, and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, are treated fully in works on canon law. The special status of canons in English-speaking countries will be considered later.
<h2>Manner of appointment</h2>

<p>As only the Holy Father can erect a chapter, so also he alone has power to appoint the individual members of a chapter. This power may be, and in fact is delegated, and hence canons are appointed sometimes by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, sometimes by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the capitular body, sometimes by others to whom the right has been given. By the rules of the Roman Chancery all <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> which become <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> <em>in curia</em> (i.e. when one who holds a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> dies in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>) are reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, also the appointment to a vacant <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a> the former holder of which has been deprived of it by an act of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the appointment of the first dignitary of each chapter, and to all other <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> which become <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> during the months of January, February, April, May, July, August, October, and November. Beyond this the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not expressly state in whom resides the power to collate to <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canonries and <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, but the general opinion is that the right is invested simultaneously in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and chapter; therefore for a valid election the majority of the canons must agree with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> when a new appointment is made. Exceptions are made in the following cases: if from the foundation of the church or <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> the appointment belongs to a particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; if there is an immemorial custom to the contrary; the appointment of the canon <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and the canon penitentiary; the canons in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Deshayes, Memento Juris Eccl., 3d ed., Paris, 1903). Appointment is practically always made by letter, and possession of a canonry cannot be obtained until the nominee presents his letter of appointment. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> orders that on the day of taking possession, or at least within two months, the new canon is to make his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and also obedience to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is made to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself or, if he be absent, to the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> or another delegated for this purpose. The profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must be made in presence of the chapter, otherwise the new canon may be deprived of possession and the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendal</a> fruits and daily distributions.
<h2>Qualifications</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> says (Sess. XXIII, XXIV) that since the dignitaries of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> were instituted to preserve and increase <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that those who are appointed should excel in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and be an example to others; likewise, as they are to assist the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his office and work, only those should be appointed who are able to fulfil the canonical <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. The requisite qualifications are: legitimate birth, proper age, Sacred orders, fitting <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, skill in <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a>, known good character and repute. Moreover the council lays down that without these qualifications the appointment is of no effect. Before the candidate is admitted to his canonry not only the one who appoints but also the chapter has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to examine and inquire whether the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> qualities are present in the candidate.
<h2>Duties</h2>

<p>The canon as a member of the chapter owes the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> reverence in three ways: by conceding him the first place; by giving him assistance; by affording him escort. Conceding the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the first place has reference to chapter choir-processions and other public acts. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> also has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the assistance of two canons in the government of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and all canons are bound to be present when he celebrates pontifically in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>; on such occasions they must meet him at an appointed place, not, however, more than 160 yards from the church; and after the service they must conduct him to the church door. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a canon with regard to choir service consists in the public recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> and being present at the Chapter Masses unless legitimately excused. There is the further <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of residence by which no canon may be absent from his choir <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> for more than three months in any year. As mentioned above, the canon must make his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> within two months of his appointment; he is likewise bound, and may be compelled by penalties, to attend the regular meetings of the chapter, and, finally, he must attend the <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons under penalty of losing his distributions or that portion of his revenues dependent on his personal presence at the church offices.
<h2>Rights (general)</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the canons independently of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are mainly concerned with matters that have reference to the administration of the chapter itself, e.g., the way in which the daily stipend is to be distributed; the order in which the canons are to be summoned to choir and chapter, etc., but they can do nothing to the disadvantage of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> or in contravention of ancient customs without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. They could not, e.g., allow a canon more than three months' non-residence, or exercise ownership over the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, or receive foundation Masses. There are, however, some things which, according to the canon law, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot do without the consent of the chapter, and other things which he cannot do without the counsel of the canons. Consent means the approval by the <em>major et sanior pars</em> (a majority, provided it be made up of the more prudent members). Counsel means consultation with the chapter before action, to prevent precipitation on the part of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. When this consultation is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> (i.e. provided for by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>), the act would be invalid without it, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not bound to follow the counsel of the chapter. The consent of the chapter is required in the following cases: for the alienation of immovable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of value belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the chapter, or the <em>mensa</em> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, i.e. his endowment; for conferring <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> the collation of which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and chapter conjointly; for the suppression of canonries and the uniting of simple <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> on account of the smallness of the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>; for uniting <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> for any other reason; for the increase or decrease of the number of the canons; for any proceedings seriously prejudicial to the canons or their successors; for the ordering of a special feast; for the surrogation of examiners or similar officers outside the time of synod. The counsel of the canons is required: when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has to make pecuniary provision out of the income of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in order to provide lectures in Scripture, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, or grammar for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; for dividing the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> of the canons into <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconal</a>, diaconal, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>; for decreeing processions; in making synodal decrees. It may be noted that lawful custom makes the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> independent of the advice of his canons in the matter of synodal decrees (<a href="../cathen/06048a.htm">Ferraris</a>, Bibl. Prompta, s.v. Capitulum., art. 2, n. 9). The special <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of canons are chiefly concerned with the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on the death or translation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. As soon as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> becomes vacant all the ordinary episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> passes to the chapter, and also all that by custom belongs to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <em>real</em> privileges belong to the canons, but not the <em>personal</em> privileges. They also succeed to those powers which have been perpetually delegated. If the chapter be reduced to one, that one can elect a <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>; but he cannot elect himself. While the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is vacant the canons cannot make any innovations, but within eight days of the vacancy they must meet for the purpose of electing one who is to rule the diocese in the name of the chapter. The election is secret and a bare majority suffices.
<h2>Insignia</h2>

<p>Canons when present in choir for the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> must wear the canonical dress. The choir or canonical dress consists of a black cassock (without train) and the cotta or <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>. Additional articles of dress, e.g. the cappa or hooded cape and a cassock of different colour, e.g. purple, are not to be worn unless specially granted by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. If the canon be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he should wear the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> and <a href="../cathen/09611a.htm">mantelletta</a> over his purple cassock. Special privileges of dress have been granted to many chapters by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> either when the chapter was erected or afterwards by particular <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a>. In all cases the terms of the <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> must be carefully observed. It is to be noted that canons are never allowed to wear over the cassock the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> only. Generally speaking, the canonical dress may be worn at functions for which the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> is not prescribed, but only in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> or when in another church the canons are present as a body (<em>capitulariter</em>), three canons being sufficient to represent the chapter in this way. Consequently the canons may not wear the choral dress in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> other than their own, nor may an individual canon wear his habit in a church which he is serving either permanently or for a time. The <em><a href="../cathen/15765b.htm">pileolus</a></em> (skull cap) and <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a> are not, strictly speaking, part of choir dress.
<h2>Precedence</h2>

<p>If, as in many instances is the case, the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> are distinct, the order of precedence is: dignitaries, canons of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> order, canons of diaconal order, and canons of <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconal</a> order. The dignitaries take precedence among themselves according to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> or well-established custom. If the remainder of the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> are all of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> order and all the holders are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, they take precedence according to priority of taking possession of their canonries. The offices of canon <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, canon penitentiary, etc., do not entitle the holders to any precedence. The precedence given to a vicar- general, if a canon, only belongs to him when wearing the dress proper to his office.
<h2>Status of canons in England</h2>

<p>The following is a summary of the legislation of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of Westminster. The chapter consists of ten canons and one dignitary who is called the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>. (In some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the number of canons has been increased.) A canon <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and a canon penitentiary must be appointed, by concursus, for each chapter, but there is no distinction into <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a>, diaconal, and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconal</a> canons. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appoints the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, and he also nominates to canonries becoming vacant in January and the alternate months of the year. In February and the other alternate months the appointments belong in turn to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the chapter. The canons do not actually make the appointment, but they send in to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> a list of three names and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may choose one of three. By a recent <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (2 April, 1903) three honorary canons are allowed to each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and in certain <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> special <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> have been granted with regard to the choir dress and the times when it may be worn. The canons meet once a month, and their choir <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> are limited to a portion of the Office on the day of meeting. Regarding the election to a vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, the canons in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> have only the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make a recommendation of three candidates whom they deem to be suitable (cf. decrees of Cong. of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, 5 Apr., 1851; 21 Apr. 1852; 21 Jan., 1855, and "Collect. S. Cong. de Prop. Fide", Rome, 1906). In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> and other countries where the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not in full vigour, the powers and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of canons are much restricted, in fact their status is mainly honorific, although in some isolated <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> a near approach is made to the legislation which governs canons in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. For the status of canons in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Quebec, see Gignac, "Compendium juris. eccl. ad usum cleri Canadensis" (Quebec, 1901), De Personis, Nos. 493-94.

<p>In addition to the special members of a chapter already mentioned there are usually appointed the following, in order to secure well-ordered services: <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a>, <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a>, cancellor, succentor, punctator, hebdomadarian. All these are not necessarily included in every chapter; the actual arrangement is a matter for local convenience and custom.
