<h2 id="i">General notions and divisions</h2>

<p>Canon law is the body of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and regulations made by or adopted by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, for the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian organization</a> and its members. The word <em>adopted</em> is here used to point out the fact that there are certain elements in canon law borrowed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> or from the writings of private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, who as such had no authority in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Canon is derived from the Greek <em>kanon</em>, i.e. a rule or practical direction (not to speak of the other meanings of the word, such as list or catalogue), a term which soon acquired an exclusively <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> signification. In the fourth century it was applied to the ordinances of the councils, and thus contrasted with the Greek word <em>nomoi</em>, the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>; the compound word "Nomocanon" was given to those collections of regulations in which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> formulated by the two authorities on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters were to be found side by side. At an early period we meet with expressions referring to the body of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation then in process of formation: <em>canones, ordo canonicus, sanctio canonica</em>; but the expression "canon law" (<em>jus canonicum</em>) becomes current only about the beginning of the twelfth century, being used in contrast with the "civil law" (<em>jus civile</em>), and later we have the "Corpus juris canonici", as we have the "Corpus juris Civilis". Canon law is also called "ecclesiastical law" (<em>jus ecclesiasticum</em>); however, strictly speaking, there is a slight difference of meaning between the two expressions: canon law denotes in particular the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the "Corpus Juris", including the regulations borrowed from <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>; whereas ecclesiastical law refers to all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> made by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> as such, including those made after the compiling of the "Corpus Juris". Contrasted with the imperial or Caesarian law (<em>jus caesareum</em>), canon law is sometimes styled pontifical law (<em>jus pontificium</em>), often also it is termed sacred law (<em>jus sacrum</em>), and sometimes even <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> (<em>jus divinum</em>: c. 2, De privil.), as it concerns holy things, and has for its object the wellbeing of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> divinely established by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.

<p>Canon law may be divided into various branches, according to the points of view from which it is considered: <ul><li>If we consider its sources, it comprises <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, including <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, based on the nature of things and on the constitution given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and human or positive law, formulated by the legislator, in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. We shall return to this later, when treating of the sources of canon law. <li>If we consider the form in which it is found, we have the written law (<em>jus scriptum</em>) comprising the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the competent authorities, and the unwritten law (<em>jus non scripture</em>), or even customary law, resulting from practice and custom; the latter however became less important as the written law developed. <li>If we consider the subject matter of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, we have the public law (<em>jus publicum</em>) and private law (<em>jus privatum</em>). This division is explained in two different ways by the different <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of writers: for most of the adherents of the Roman <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/03467c.htm">Cavagnis</a> (Instit. jur. publ. eccl., Rome, 1906, I, 8), public law is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and even as a perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> such as it has been established by its Divine founder: private law would therefore embrace all the regulations of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> concerning the internal organization of that <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the functions of its <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of its members. Thus understood, the public ecclesiastical law would be derived almost exclusively from Divine and <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. On the other hand, most of the adherents of the German <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, following the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> (Inst., I, i, 4; "Publicum jus est quad ad statuary rei Romanae spectat: privatum quad ad privatorum utilitatem"), define public law as the body of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> determining the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of those invested with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, whereas for them private law is that which sets forth the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> as such. Public law would, therefore, directly intend the welfare of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> as such, and indirectly that of its members; while private law would look primarily to the wellbeing of the individual and secondarily to that of the community. <li>Public law is divided into external law (<em>jus externum</em>) and internal law (<em>jus internum</em>). External law determines the relations of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> with other <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. either secular bodies (the relations therefore of <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">the Church and the State</a>) or religious bodies, that is, interconfessional relations. Internal law is concerned with the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the relations subsisting between the lawfully constituted authorities and their subjects. <li>Considered from the point of view of its expression, canon law may be divided into several branches, so closely allied, that the terms used to designate them are often employed almost indifferently: <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> and special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; universal law and particular law; general law and singular law (<em>jus commune et speciale</em>; <em>jus universale et particulare</em>; <em>jus generale et singulare</em>). It is easy to point out the difference between them: the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is that of a wider or a more limited scope; to be more precise, <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> refers to things, universal law to territories, general law to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; so regulations affecting only certain things, certain territories, certain classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, being a restriction or an addition, constitute special, particular, or singular law, and even local or individual law. This exceptional law is often referred to as a privilege (<em>privilegium, lex privata</em>), though the expression is applied more usually to concessions made to an individual. The <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, therefore, is that which is to be observed with regard to a certain matter, unless the legislator has foreseen or granted exceptions; for instance, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> regulating <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> contain special provisions for <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> subject to the right of patronage. Universal law is that which is <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> for the whole Church; but different countries and different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> may have local <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> limiting the application of the former and even derogating from it. Finally, different classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, etc., have their own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which are superadded to the general law. <li>We have to distinguish between the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Western or <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>, and of each of them. Likewise, between the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and those of the non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Churches</a> or confessions, the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> and the various Eastern Orthodox Churches. <li>Finally, if we look to the history or chronological evolution of canon law, we find three epochs: from the beginning to the "Decretum" of Gratian exclusively; from Gratian to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; from the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> to our day. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of these three periods is referred to respectively as the ancient, the new, and the recent law (<em>jus antiquum, novum, novissimum</em>), though some writers prefer to speak of the ancient law, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and the modern law (Laurentius, "Instit.", n.4). </ul>


<h2 id="ii">Canon law as a science</h2>

<p>As we shall see in treating of the gradual development of the material of canon law (see below, IV), though a legislative power has always existed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and though it has always been exercised, a long period had necessarily to elapse before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were reduced to a harmonious systematic body, serving as a basis for methodical study and giving rise to general theories. In the first place, the legislative authority makes <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> only when circumstances require them and in accordance with a definite plan. For centuries, nothing more was done than to collect successively the canons of councils, ancient and recent, the letters of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and episcopal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>; guidance was sought for in these, when analogous cases occurred, but no one thought of extracting general principles from them or of systematizing all the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> then in force. In the eleventh century certain collections group under the same headings the canons that treat of the same matters; however, it is only in the middle of the twelfth century that we meet in the "Decretum" of Gratian the first really scientific treatise on canon law. The School of Bologna had just revived the study of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>; Gratian sought to inaugurate a similar study of canon law. But, while compilations of texts and official collections were available for <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, or "Corpus juris civilis", Gratian had no such assistance. He therefore adopted the plan of inserting the texts in the body of his general treatise; from the disordered mass of canons collected from the earliest days, he selected not only the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> actually in force (eliminating the regulations which had fallen into desuetude, or which were revoked, or not of general application) but also the principles; he elaborated a system of law which, however incomplete, was nevertheless methodical. The <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of canon law, i.e. the methodical and coordinated <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of ecclesiastical law, was at length established.

<p>Gratian's "Decretum" was a wonderful work; welcomed, taught and glossed by the decretists at Bologna and later in the other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, it was for a long time the textbook of canon law. However his plan was defective and confusing, and, after the day of the glosses and the strictly literal commentaries, it was abandoned in favour of the method adopted by <a href="../cathen/02504a.htm">Bernard of Pavia</a> in his "Breviarium" and by St. <a href="../cathen/12671c.htm">Raymund of Pennafort</a> in the official collection of the "Decretals" of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in 1234 (see <a href="../cathen/04391a.htm">CORPUS JURIS CANONICI</a>). These collections, which did not include the texts used by Gratian, grouped the materials into five books, each divided into "titles", and under each title the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> or fragments of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> were grouped in chronological order. The five books, the subject matter of which is recalled by the well-known verse: "judex, judicium, clerus, connubia, crimen" (i.e. judge, judgment, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, crime), did not display a very <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> plan; not to speak of certain titles that were more or less out of place. They treated successively of the depositaries of authority, procedure, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the things pertaining to them, marriage, crimes and penalties. In spite of its defects, the system had at least the merit of being official; not only was it adopted in the latter collections, but it served as the basis for almost all canonical works up to the sixteenth century, and even to our day, especially in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, each of which had a faculty of canon law.

<p>However, the method of studying and teaching gradually developed: if the early <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretalists</a> made use of the elementary plan of the gloss and literal commentary, their successors in composing their treatises were more independent of the text; they commented on the titles, not on the chapters or the words; often they followed the titles or chapters only nominally and artificially. In the sixteenth century they tried to apply, not to the official collections, but in their lectures on canon law the method and division of the "Institutes" of Justinian: <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, things, actions or procedure, crimes, and penalties (Institutes, I, ii, 12). This plan, popularized by the "Institutiones juris canonici" of Lancellotti (1563), has been followed since by most of the canonist authors of "Institutiones" or manuals, though there has been considerable divergence in the subdivisions; most of the more extensive works, however, preserved the order of the "Decretals". This was also followed in the 1917 code. In later times many textbooks, especially in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, began to adopt original plans. In the sixteenth century too, the study of canon law was developed and improved like that of other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, by the critical spirit of the age: <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> texts were rejected and the <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em> and tendency or intention of later <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> traced back to the customs of former days. Canon law was more studied and better understood; writings multiplied, some of an historical nature, others practical, according to the inclination of the authors. In the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, it became a special study, though as might be expected, not always held in equal esteem. It may be noted too that the study of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> is now frequently separated from that of canon law, a result of the changes that have come over <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. On the other hand, in too many <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> the teaching of ecclesiastical law is not sufficiently distinguished from that of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. The publication of the new general code of canon law will certainly bring about a more normal state of affairs.

<p>The first object of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of canon law is to fix the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that are in force. This is not difficult when one has exact and recent texts, drawn up as abstract <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> e.g. most of the texts since the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and as will be the case for all canon law when the new code is published. But it was not so in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; it was the canonists who, to a large extent, formulated the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> by extracting it from the accumulated mass of texts or by generalizing from the individual decisions in the early collections of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in force is known it must be explained, and this second object of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of canon law is still unchanged. It consists in showing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense, the reason, the extension and application of each law and each institution. This necessitates a careful and exact application of the triple method of exposition, historical, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, and practical: the first explains the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in accordance with its source and the evolution of customs; the second explains its principles; the last shows how it is to be applied at present. This practical application is the object of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, which collects, coordinates and utilizes, for more or less analogous cases, the decisions of the competent tribunal. From this we may learn the position of canon law in the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. It is a judicial <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, differing from the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> inasmuch as it treats of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of an other <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>; but as this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is of the spiritual order and in a certain sense <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, canon law belongs also to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>. In this category it comes after <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, which studies and explains in accordance with revelation, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> to be believed; it is supported by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, but in its turn it formulates the practical rules toward which <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> tends, and so it has been called "theologia practica", "theologia rectrix". In as far as it is practical the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of canon law is closely related to <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>; however, it differs from the latter which is not directly concerned with the acts prescribed or forbidden by the external law, but only with the rectitude of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">human acts</a> in the light of the last end of man, whereas, canon law treats of the external <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> relating to the good order of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> rather than the workings of the individual <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Juridical, historical, and above all <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are most useful for the comprehensive study of canon law.

<h2 id="iii">Sources of canon law</h2>

<p>This expression has a twofold meaning; it may refer to the sources from which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> come and which give the latter their judicial force (<em>fortes juris essendi</em>); or it may refer to the sources where canon law is to be found (<em>fortes juris cognoscendi</em>), i.e. the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> themselves such as they occur in the texts and various codes. These sources are also called the material and the formal sources of canon law. We shall consider first the sources under the former aspect.

<p>The ultimate source of canon law is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose will is manifested either by the very nature of things (natural <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>), or by Revelation (positive <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>). Both are contained in the Scriptures and in Tradition. Positive <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> cannot contradict <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>; it rather confirms it and renders it more definite. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> accepts and considers both as sovereign binding <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which it can interpret but can not modify; however, it does not discover <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> by philosophic speculation; it receives it, with positive <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His inspired Books, though this does not imply a confusion of the two kinds of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has preserved in addition to the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a> some <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> closely allied to <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, e.g. certain matrimonial impediments; as to the other <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to His chosen people, it considers them to have been ritual and declares them abrogated by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Or rather, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Lawgiver of the spiritual <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> founded by Him (Con. Trid., Sess. VI, "De justif.", can. I), has replaced them by the fundamental <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which He gave His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, if we may so call it, is found in the Gospels, in the Apostolic writings, in the living Tradition, which transmits <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. On this positive <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> depend the essential principles of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> constitution, the primacy, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, the essential elements of Divine worship and the Sacraments, the indissolubility of marriage, etc.

<p>Again, to attain its sublime end, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, endowed by its Founder with legislative power, makes <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in conformity with natural and <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. The sources or authors of this positive ecclesiastical law are essentially the episcopate and its head, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the successors of the Apostolic College and its divinely appointed head, Saint Peter. They are, properly speaking, the active sources of canon law. Their activity is exercised in its most solemn form by the ecumenical councils, where the episcopate united with its head, and convoked and presided over by him, with him defines its teaching and makes the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that bind the whole Church. The canons of the Ecumenical councils, especially those of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, hold an exceptional place in ecclesiastical law. But, without infringing on the ordinary power of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as head of the episcopate, possesses in himself the same powers as the episcopate united with him. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the disciplinary and legislative power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> has not always, in the course of centuries, been exercised in the same manner and to the same extent, but in proportion as the administration became centralized, their direct intervention in legislation became more and more marked; and so the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> is the most fruitful source of canon law; he can abrogate the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> made by his predecessors or by Ecumenical councils; he can legislate for the whole church or for a part thereof, a country or a given body of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>; if he is morally bound to take advice and to follow the dictates of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, he is not legally <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to obtain the consent of any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or to observe any particular form; his power is limited only by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, natural and positive, dogmatic and moral. Furthermore, he is, so to say, the living law, for he is considered as having all law in the treasury of his heart ("in scrinio pectoris"; <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. c. i, "De Constit." in VI). From the earliest ages the letters of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a> constitute, with the canons of the councils, the principal element of canon law, not only of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and its immediate dependencies. but of all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>; they are everywhere relied upon and collected, and the ancient canonical compilations contain a large number of these precious "decretals" (<em>decreta, statuta, epistolae decretales,</em> and <em>epistolae synodicae</em>). Later, the pontifical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> more usually as constitutions, Apostolic Letters, the latter being classified as <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> or <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Briefs</a>, according to their external form, or even as spontaneous acts, "Motu proprio". Moreover, the legislative and disciplinary power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> not being an incommunicable privilege, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and regulations made in his name and with his <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> possess his authority: in fact, though most of the regulations made by the Congregations of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and other organs of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> are incorporated in the Apostolic Letters, yet the custom exists and is becoming more general for legislation to be made by mere decrees of the Congregations, with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> approval. These are the "Acts of the Holy See" (Acta Sancte Sedis), and their object or purpose permitting, are real <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> (see <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">ROMAN CURIA</a>).

<p>Next to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> united in local councils, and each of them individually, are sources of law for their common or particular territory; canons of national or provincial councils, and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, constitute local law. Numerous texts of such origin are found in the ancient canonical collections. At the present day and for a long time past, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has laid down clearly the powers of local councils and of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; if their decrees should interfere with the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> they have no authority save in virtue of pontifical <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. It is well known that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> are not referred to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>, whereas the decrees of provincial councils are submitted for examination and approval to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (Const. "Immensa" of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, 22 Jan., 1587). We may liken to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in this matter various bodies that have the right of governing themselves and thus enjoy a certain autonomy; such are <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> with territorial <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, some exempt chapters and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, etc. The concessions granted to them are generally subject to a certain measure of control.

<p>Other sources of law are rather impersonal in their nature, chief among them being custom or the unwritten law. In canon law custom has become almost like a legislator; not in the sense that the people are made their own lawgiver, but a practice followed by the greater part of the community, and which is reasonable and fulfills the legal requirements for prescription and is observed as <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, acquires the force of law by at least the tacit consent of the legislator. Under such circumstances custom can create or rescind a legal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, derogate from a law, interpret it, etc. But it must be remarked that in our days, owing to the fully developed body of written law, custom plays a much less important part than did the practices and habits of early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times, when there was but little written law and even that seldom of wide application. The <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> of different nations, and especially the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, may be numbered among the accessory sources of canon law. But it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to explain more exactly its role and importance. Evidently secular law cannot be, strictly speaking, a source of canon law, the State as such having no competence in spiritual matters; yet it may become so by the more or less formal acceptation of particular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. We pass by in the first place the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> made by the mutual agreement of both parties, such as the legislation of the numerous assemblies in the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> kingdom, and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom and empire, where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sat with the lords and nobles. Such also is the case of the <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> of later ages, real contracts between the two powers. In these cases we have an ecclesiastico-civil law, the legal force of which arose from the joint action of the two competent authorities. It is in a different sense that <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, Germanic law, and in a lesser degree modern law, have become a subsidiary source of canon law.

<p>It must be remembered that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> existed for a long time before having a complete and coordinated system of law; that many daily acts of its administration, while objectively canonical, were of the same nature as similar acts in civil matters, e.g. contracts, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, and in general the administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; it was quite natural for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to accommodate itself in these matters to the existing flows, with out positively approving of them. Later when the canonists of the twelfth century began to systematize the ecclesiastical law, they found themselves in presence, on the one hand, of a fragmentary canon law, and on the other hand of the complete methodical Roman code; they had recourse to the latter to supply what was wanting in the former, whence the maxim adopted by the canonists and inserted in the "Corpus Juris", that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> acts according to <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> when canon law is silent (cap. 1. "De novi op. nunc.", X, i, V, tit. xxxii). Moreover, in the Teutonic kingdoms the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> followed the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> as a personal statute. However, in proportion as the written canon law increased, <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> became of less practical value in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (cap. 28, X, "De priv.", X, lib. V, tit. xxxiii). Canon law, it may be said, adopted from <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> what relates to <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, contracts, judiciary actions, and to a great extent civil procedure. Other Roman <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were the object of a more positive recognition than mere usage, i.e. they were formally approved, those, for instance, which though of secular origin, concerned <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> things, e.g. the Byzantine ecclesiastical laws, or again <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of civil origin and character but which were changed into canonical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> e.g. the impediment of marriage arising from adoption. The juridical influence of Teutonic law was much less important, if we abstract from the inevitable adaptation to the customs of barbarous races, yet some survivals of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation are worthy of note: the somewhat <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> system of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>; the computation of the degrees of kindred; the assimilating of the penitential practices to the system of penal compensation (<em>wehrgeld</em>); finally, but for a time only, justification from criminal charges on the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of guarantors or co-jurors (De purgatione canonica, lib. V, tit. xxxiv).

<p>Modern law has only a restricted and local influence on canon law, and that particularly on two points. On the one hand, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> conforms to the civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> on mixed matters, especially with regard to the administration of its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; on some occasions even it has finally adopted as its own measures passed by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil powers</a> acting independently; a notable case is the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1809 on the "Fabriques d'&eacute;glise". On the other hand, modern legislation is indebted to the canon law for certain beneficial measures: part of the procedure in criminal, civil, and matrimonial cases, and to some extent, the organization of courts and tribunals.

<h2 id="iv">Historical development of texts and collections</h2>

<p>Considered under the second aspect, the sources of canon law are the legislative texts, and the collections of those texts whence we derive our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. In order to appreciate fully the reasons for and the utility of the great work of codification of the canon law, recently begun by order of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to recall the general history of those texts and collections, ever increasing in number up to the present time. A detailed account of each of the canonical collections is here out of place; the more important ones are the subject of special articles, to which we refer the reader; it will suffice if we exhibit the different stages in the development of these texts and collections, and make clear the movement to wards centralization and unification that has led up to the present situation. Even in the private collections of the early centuries, in which the series of conciliary canons were merely brought together in more or less chronological order, a constant tendency towards unification is noticeable. From the ninth century onwards the collections are systematically arranged; with the thirteenth century begins the first official collections, thenceforth the nucleus around which the new legislative texts centre, though it is not yet possible to reduce them to a harmonious and coordinated code. Before tracing the various steps of this evolution, some terms require to be explained. The name "canonical collections" is given to all collections of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislative texts, because the principal texts were the canons of the councils. At first the authors of these collections contented themselves with bringing together the canons of the different councils in chronological order; consequently these are called "chronological" collections; in the West, the last important chronological collection is that of <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore</a>. After his time the texts were arranged according to subject matter; these are the "systematic" collections, the only form in use since the time of <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore</a>. All the ancient collections are private, due to personal initiative, and have, therefore, as collections, no official authority: each text has only its own intrinsic value; even the "Decretum" of Gratian is of this nature. On the other hand, official or authentic collections are those that have been made or at least <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the legislator. They begin with the "Compilatio tertia" of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>; the later collections of the "Corpus Juris", except the "Extravagantes", are official. All the texts in an official collection have the force of law. There are also general collections and particular collections: the former treating of legislation in general, the latter treating of some special subject, for instance, marriage, procedure, etc., or even of the local law of a district. Finally, considered chronologically, the sources and collections are classified as previous to or later than the "Corpus Juris".
<h3 id="A">Canonical collections in the East</h3>

<p>Until the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> began to enjoy peace, the written canon law was very meagre; after making full allowance for the documents that must have perished, we can discover only a fragmentary law, made as circumstances demanded, and devoid of all system. Unity of legislation, in as far as it can be expected at that period, is identical with a certain uniformity of practice, based on the prescriptions of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> relative to the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the liturgy, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, etc. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, organized everywhere in the same way, exercised almost everywhere the same functions. But at an early period we discover a greater local disciplinary uniformity between the Churches of the great sees (Rome, <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, later Constantinople) and the Churches depending immediately on them. Further it is the disciplinary decisions of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the various regions that form the first nucleus of local canon law; these texts, spreading gradually from one country to another by means of the collections, obtain universal dissemination and in this way are the basis of general canon law.

<p>There were, however, in the East, from the early days up to the end of the fifth century, certain writings, closely related to each other, and which were in reality brief canon law treatises on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and especially on the liturgy. We refer to works attributed to the Apostles, very popular in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a>, though devoid of official authority, and which may be called pseudo-epigraphic, rather than <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. The principal writings of this kind are the "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" or "Didache", the "Didascalia", based on the "Didache"; the "Apostolic Constitutions", an expansion of the two preceding works; then the "Apostolic Church Ordinance", the "Definitio canonica SS. Apostolorum", the "Testament of the Lord" and the "Octateuch of Clement"; lastly the "Apostolic Canons". Of all this literature, only the "Apostolic Canons" were included in the canonical collections of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. The most important of these documents the "Apostolic Constitutions", was removed by the Second Canon of the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Council in Trullo</a> (692), as having been interpolated by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. As to the eighty-five <a href="../cathen/03279a.htm">Apostolic Canons</a>, accepted by the same council, they rank yet first in the above-mentioned "Apostolic" collection; the first fifty translated into Latin by <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a> (c. 500), were included in the Western collections and afterwards in the "Corpus Juris".

<p>As the later law of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">separated</a> <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> did not influence the Western collections, we need not treat of it, but go on to consider only the Greek collection. It begins early in the fourth century: in the different provinces of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, to the canons of local councils are added those of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">ecumenical Council of Nicea</a> (325), everywhere held in esteem. The Province of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> furnished the penitentiary decisions of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> and Neoc&aelig;sarea (314); Antioch; the canons of the famous Council "in encaeniis" (341), a genuine code of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> organization; Paphlagonia, that of the Council of <a href="../cathen/06377b.htm">Gangra</a> (343), a reaction against the first excesses of asceticism; Phrygia, the fifty-nine canons of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> on different disciplinary and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> matters. This collection was so highly esteemed that at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451) the canons were read as one series. It was increased later by the addition of the canons of (Constantinople (381), with other canons attributed to it, those of Ephesus (431). Chalcedon (451), and the Apostolic canons. In 692 the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Council in Trullo</a> passed 102 disciplinary canons, the second of which enumerates the elements of the official collection: they are the texts we have just mentioned, together with the canons of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>, and of Carthage (419), according to <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>, and numerous canonical letters of the great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, SS. <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>, Basil, etc. If to these be added the canons of the two ecumenical councils of Nicea (787) and Constantinople (869) we have all the elements of the definitive collection in its final shape. A few "systematic" collections may be mentioned as pertaining to this period: one containing fifty titles by an unknown author about 535; another with twenty-five titles of the ecclesiastical laws of Justinian; a collection of fifty titles drawn up about 550, by John the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Antioch. The compilations known as the "Nomocanons" are more important, because they bring together the civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and the ecclesiastical laws on the same subjects; the two principal are the Nomocanon, wrongly attributed to John the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a>, but which dates from the end of the sixth century, with fifty titles, and another, drawn up in the seventh century, and afterwards augmented by the Patriarch Photius in 883.
<h3 id="B">The canonical collections in the West to Pseudo-Isidore</h3>

<p>In the West, canonical collections developed as in the East, but about two centuries later. At first appear collections of national or local <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and the tendency towards centralization is partially effected in the ninth century. Towards the end of the fourth century there is yet in the West no canonical collection, not even a local one, those of the fifth century are essentially local, but all of them borrow from the Greek councils. The latter were known in the West by two Latin versions, one called the "Hispana" or "Isidorian", because it was inserted in the Spanish canonical collection, attributed to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a>, the other called the "Itala" or "ancient" (Prisca), because <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>, in the first half of the sixth century, found it in use at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and being dissatisfied with its imperfections improved it. Almost all the Western collections, therefore, are based on the same texts as the Greek collection, hence the marked influence of that collection on Western canon law.

<p>(1) At the end of the fifth century the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> was completely organized and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> many legislative texts; but no collection of them had yet been made. The only extra-Roman canons recognized were the canons of Nicea and Sardica, the latter being joined to the former, and at times even cited as the canons of Nicea. The Latin version of the ancient Greek councils was known, but was not adopted as ecclesiastical law. Towards the year 500 <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a> compiled at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a double collection, one of the councils, the other of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a>. The former, executed at the request of Stephen, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Salona</a>, is a translation of the Greek councils, including Chalcedon, and begins with the fifty Apostolic canons; Dionysius adds to it only the Latin text of the canons of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> and of Carthage (419), in which the more ancient <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">African councils</a> are partially reproduced. The second is a collection of thirty-nine <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a>, from Siricius (384) to Anastasius II (496-98). (See <a href="../cathen/03281a.htm">COLLECTIONS OF ANCIENT CANONS</a>.) Thus joined together these two collections became the canonical code of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, not by official <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, but by authorized practice. But while in the work of Dionysius the collection of conciliary canons remained unchanged, that of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> was successively increased; it continued to incorporate letters of the different <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> till about the middle of the eighth century when <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> gave (774) the collection of Dionysius to the future <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Emperor Charlemagne</a> as the canonical book of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. This collection, often called the "Dionysio-Hadriana", was soon officially received in all <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> territory, where it was cited as the "Liber Canonum", and was adopted for the whole empire of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> at the Diet of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> in 802. This was an important step towards the centralization and unification of the ecclesiastical law, especially as the Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world hardly extended beyond the limits of the empire, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and the south of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> having been lost to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through the victories of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>.

<p>(2) The canon law of the African Church was strongly centralized at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>; the documents naturally took the form of a collection, as it was customary to read and insert in the Acts of each council the decisions of the preceding councils. At the time of the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, the canonical code of the African Church comprised, after the canons of Nicea, those of the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> under Bishop Gratus (about 348), under Genethlius (390), of twenty or twenty-two plenary council under Aurelius (from 393 to 427), and the minor councils of Constantinople. Unfortunately these records have not come down to us in their entirety; we possess them in two forms: in the collection of <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>, as the canons of a "Concilium Africanum"; in the Spanish collection, as those of eight councils (the fourth wrongly attributed, being a document from Arles, dating about the beginning of the sixth century). Through these two channels the African texts entered into Western canon law. It will suffice to mention the two "systematic" collections of <a href="../cathen/06317a.htm">Fulgentius Ferrandus</a> and <a href="../cathen/04486a.htm">Cresconius</a>.

<p>(3) The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Gaul had no local religious centre, the territory being divided into unstable kingdoms; it is not surprising therefore that we meet no centralized canon law or universally accepted collection. There are numerous councils, however, and an abundance of texts; but if we except the temporary authority of the See of Arles, no church of Gaul could point to a permanent group of dependent <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The canonical collections were fairly numerous, but none was generally accepted. The most widespread was the "Quesneliana", called after its editor (the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Paschase Quesnel</a>), rich, but badly arranged, containing many Greek, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gallic</a>, and other councils, also pontifical <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>. With the other collections it gave way to the "Hadriana", at the end of the eighth century.

<p>(4) In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, on the contrary, at least after the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was strongly centralized in the See of Toledo, and in close union with the royal power. Previous to this, we must note the collection of <a href="../cathen/09731b.htm">St. Martin of Braga</a>, a kind of adaptation of conciliary canons, often incorrectly cited in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> as the "Capitula Martini papae" (about 563). It was absorbed in the large and important collection of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> Church. The latter, begun as early as the council of 633 and increased by the canons of subsequent councils, is known as the "Hispana" or "Isidoriana", because in later times it was attributed (erroneously) to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a>. It comprises two parts: the councils and the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>; the councils are arranged in four sections: the East, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and chronological order is observed in each section; the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>, 104 in number, range from Pope St. Damasus to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> (366-604). Its original elements consist of the Spanish councils from Elvira (about 300) to the Seventeenth Council of Toledo in 694. The influence of this collection, in the form it assumed about the middle of the ninth century, when the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">False Decretals</a> were inserted into it, was very great.

<p>(5) Of Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> we need mention only the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> collection of the beginning of the eighth century, from which several texts passed to the continent; it is remarkable for including among its canons citations from the Scriptures and the Fathers.

<p>(6) The collection of the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">False Decretals</a>, or the Pseudo-Isidore (about 850), is the last and most complete of the "chronological" collections, and therefore the one most used by the authors of the subsequent "systematic" collections; it is the "Hispana" or Spanish collection together with <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> attributed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the first centuries up to the time of St. Damasus, when the authentic <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> begin. It exerted a very great influence.

<p>(7) To conclude the list of collections, where the later canonists were to garner their materials, we must mention the <a href="../cathen/11636a.htm">"Penitentials"</a>, the "Ordines" or ritual collections, the "Formularies", especially the <a href="../cathen/09215c.htm">"Liber Diurnus"</a>; also compilations of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> either purely secular, or semi-ecclesiastical, like the "Capitularies" (q.v.). The name "capitula" or "capitularia" is given also to the episcopal ordinances quite common in the ninth century. It may be noted that the author of the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">False Decretals</a> forged also <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> "Capitularies", under the name of Benedict the Deacon, and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> episcopal "Capitula", under the name of Angilramnus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>.
<h3 id="C">Canonical collections to the time of Gratian</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> was meanwhile moving towards closer unity; the local character of canonical discipline and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> gradually disappears, and the authors of canonical collections exhibit a more personal note, i.e. they pick out more or less advantageously the texts, which they borrow from the "chronological" compilations, though they display as yet no critical discernment, and include many <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> documents, while others continue to be attributed to the wrong sources. They advance, nevertheless, especially when to the bare texts they add their own opinions and <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. From the end of the ninth century to the middle of the twelfth these collections are very numerous; many of them are still unpublished, and some deservedly so. We can only mention the principal ones: <ul><li>A collection in twelve books, compiled in Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and dedicated to an Archbishop Anselm, doubtless Anselm II of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (833-97), still unedited; it seems to have been widely used. <li>The "Libri duo de synodalibus causis" of Regino, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Pr&uuml;m (d. 915), a pastoral visitation manual of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, edited by Wasserschleben (1840). <li>The voluminous compilation, in twenty books, of Burchard, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Worms, compiled between 1012 and 1022, entitled the "Collectarium", also "Decretum", a manual for the use of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in their ministry; the nineteenth book, "Corrector" or "Medicus", treats of the administration of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, and was often current as a distinct work. This widely circulated collection is in P.L., CXL. At the end of the eleventh century there appeared in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> several collections favouring the reform of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> and supporting the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the in vestiture strife; some of the authors utilized for their works the Roman archives. <li>The collection of Anselm, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> (d. 1086), in thirteen books, still unedited, an influential work. <li>The collection of Cardinal Deusdedit, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Pope Victor III</a> (1087), it treats of the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a>, and was edited by Martinucci in 1869, more recently and better by Wolf von Glanvell (1905). <li>The "Breviarium" of Cardinal Atto; edited by <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a>, "Script. vet. nova collect.", VI, app. 1832. <li>The collection of <a href="../cathen/02673a.htm">Bonizo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sutri in ten books, written after 1089, still unedited. <li>The collection of Cardinal Gregory, called by him "Polycarpus", in eight books, written before 1120, yet unedited. <li>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> we must mention the small collection of Abbo, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fleury (d. 1004). in fifty-two chapters, in P.L., CXXXIX; and especially <li>the collections of <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Ives</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> (d. 1115 or 1117), i.e. the "Collectio trium partium", the "Decretum", especially the "Panormia", a short compilation in eight books, extracted from the preceding two works, and widely used. The "Decretum" and the "Panormia" are in P.L., CLXI. <li>The unedited Spanish collection of Saragossa (Caesar-augustana) is based on these works of <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Ives of Chartres</a>. <li>Finally, the "De misericordia et justitia", in three books, composed before 1121 by Algerus of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, a general treatise on <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, in which is fore shadowed the scholastic method of Gratian, reprinted in P.L., CLXXX. </ul>
<h3 id="D">The "Decretum" of Gratian: the Decretists</h3>

<p>The "Concordantia discordantium canonum", known later as "Decretum", which Gratian published at Bologna about 1148, is not, as we consider it today, a collection of canonical texts, but a general treatise, in which the texts cited are inserted to help in establishing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the work is very rich in texts and there is hardly a canon of any importance contained in the earlier collections (including the decisions of the Lateran Council of 1139 and recent <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a>) that Gratian has not used. His object, however, was to build up a juridical system from all these documents. Despite its imperfections, it must be admitted that the work of Gratian was as near perfection as was then possible. For that reason it was adopted at Bologna, and soon elsewhere, as the textbook for the study of canon law. (For an account of this collection see <a href="../cathen/04391a.htm">CORPUS JURIS CANONICI</a>; CANONS.) We may here recall again that the "Decretum" of Gratian is not a codification, but a privately compiled treatise; further, that the building up of a general system of canon law was the work of the canonists, and not of the legislative authorities as such.

<p>Quite as the professors at Bologna commented on Justinian's "Corpus juris civilis", so they began at once to comment on Gratian's work, the personal element as well as his texts. The first commentators are called the "Decretists". In their lectures (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>lecturae</em>, readings) they treated of the conclusions to be drawn from each part and solved the problems (<em>quaestiones</em>) arising therefrom. They synopsized their teaching in <a href="../cathen/06588a.htm">"glosses"</a>, interlinear at first, then marginal, or they composed separate treatises known as "Apparatus", "Summae", "Repetitiones", or else collected "casus", "questiones", "Margaritae", "Breviaria", etc. The principal decretists are: <ul><li>Paucapalea, perhaps the first disciple of Gratian, whence, it is said, the name "palea" given to the additions to the "Decretum" (his "Summa" was edited by Schulte in 1890); <li>Roland Bandinelli, later <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (his "Summa" was edited by Thaner in 1874); <li>Omnibonus, 1185 (see Schulte, "De Decreto ab Omnibono abbreviate", 1892); <li>John of <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a> (d. <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city in 1190); <li>Rufinus ("Summa" edited by Singer, 1902); <li><a href="../cathen/14291c.htm">Stephen of Tournai</a> (d. 1203; "Summa" edited by Schulte, 1891); <li>the great canonist <a href="../cathen/07527a.htm">Huguccio</a> (d. 1910; "Summa" edited by M. Gillmann); <li><a href="../cathen/13770b.htm">Sicard of Cremona</a> (d. 1215); <li>John the Teuton, really Semeca or Zemcke (d. 1245); <li><a href="../cathen/02361a.htm">Guido de Baysio</a>, the "archdeacon" (of Bologna, d. 1313); and especially <li><a href="../cathen/02315b.htm">Bartholomew of Brescia</a> (d. 1258), author of the "gloss" on the "Decretum" in its last form.</ul>
<h3 id="E">Decretals and Decretalists</h3>

<p>While lecturing on Gratian's work the canonists laboured to complete and elaborate the master's teaching; with that view they collected assiduously the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and especially the canons of the Ecumenical councils of the Lateran (1179, 1215); but these compilations were not intended to form a complete code, they merely centred round and supplemented Gratian's "Decretum"; for that reason these <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> are known as the "Extravagantes", i.e. outside of, or extraneous to, the official collections. The five collections thus made between 1190 and 1226 (see <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">DECRETALS</a>), and which were to serve as the basis for the work of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, mark a distinct step forward in the evolution of canon law: whereas Gratian had inserted the texts in his own treatise, and the canonists wrote their works without including the texts, we have now compilations of supplementary texts for the purpose of teaching, but which nevertheless remain quite distinct; in addition, we at last find the legislators taking part officially in editing the collections. While the "Breviarium" of <a href="../cathen/02504a.htm">Bernard of Pavia</a>, the first to exhibit the division into five books and into titles, which St. <a href="../cathen/12671c.htm">Raymund of Pennafort</a> was later to adopt, is the work of a private individual, the "Compilatio tertia" of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> in 1210, and the "Compilatio quinta" of <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, in 1226, are official collections. Though the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, doubtless, intended only to give the professors at Bologna correct and authentic texts, they nevertheless acted officially; these collections, however, are but supplements to Gratian.

<p>This is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the great collection of "Decretals" of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">DECRETALS</a> and <a href="../cathen/04391a.htm">CORPUS JURIS CANONICI</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wished to collect in a more uniform and convenient manner the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> scattered through so many different compilations; he entrusted this synopsis to his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> <a href="../cathen/12671c.htm">Raymund of Pennafort</a>, and in 1234 sent it officially to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Bologna and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He did not wish to suppress or supplant the "Decretum" of Gratian, but this eventually occurred. The "Decretals" of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, though composed in great part of specific decisions, represented in fact a more advanced state of law; furthermore, the collection was sufficiently extensive to touch almost every matter, and could serve as a basis for a complete course of instruction. It soon gave rise to a series of commentaries, glosses, and works, as the "Decretum" of Gratian had done, only these were more important since they were based on more recent and actual legislation. The commentators of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> were known as Decretalists. The author of the "gloss" was <a href="../cathen/02498c.htm">Bernard de Botone</a> (d. 1263); the text was commented on by the most distinguished canonists; among the best known previous to the sixteenth century, we must mention: <ul><li><a href="../cathen/02504a.htm">Bernard of Pavia</a> ("Summa" edited by Laspeyres, 1860), <li>Tancred, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Bologna, d. 1230 ("Summa de Matrimonio", ed. Wunderlich, 1841); <li>Godfrey of <a href="../cathen/15016d.htm">Trani</a> (1245); <li>Sinibaldo Fieschi, later <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> (1254), whose "Apparatus in quinque libros decre taliurn" has been frequently reprinted since 1477; <li><a href="../cathen/07238a.htm">Henry of Susa</a>, later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> (d. 1271), hence "Hostiensis"; his "Summa Hostiensis", or "Summa aurea" was one of the best known canonical works, and was printed as early as 1473; <li>Aegilius de Fuscarariis (d. 1289); <li>William Durandus (d. 1296, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10180a.htm">Mende</a>), surnamed "Speculator", on account of his important treatise on procedure, the "Speculum judiciale", printed in 1473; <li><a href="../cathen/02361a.htm">Guido de Baysio</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">"archdeacon"</a>, already mentioned; <li>Nicolas de Tudeschis (d. 1453), also known as "Abbes siculus" or simply "Panormitanus" (or also "Abbas junior seu modernus") to distinguish him from the "Abbas antiques", whose name is unknown and who commented on the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> about 1275); Nicolas left a "Lecture" on the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, the Liber Sextus, and the Clementines.</ul>

<p>For some time longer, the same method of collecting was followed; not to speak of the private compilations, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> continued to keep up to date the "Decretals" of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>; in 1245 <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> sent a collection of forty-two <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, ordering them to be inserted in their proper places; in 1253 he forwarded the "initia" or first words of the authentic <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> that were to be accepted. Later <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> and <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> did likewise, but with little profit, and none of these brief supplementary collections survived. The work was again undertaken by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, who had prepared and published an official collection to complete the five existing books; this was known as the "Sextus" (Liber Sextus). <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> also had prepared a collection which, in addition to his own <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>, contained the decisions of the Council of Vienne (1311-12); it was published in 1317 by his successor <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> and was called the "Clementina." This was the last of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> official collections. Two later compilations included in the "Corpus Juris" are private works, the "Extravagantes of John XXII", arranged in 1325 by Zenzelin de Cassanis, who glossed them, and the "Extra vagantes communes", a belated collection; it was only in the edition of the "Corpus Juris" by Jean Chappuis, in 1500, that these collections found a fixed form. The "Sextus" was glossed and commented by Joannes Andrae, called the "fons et tuba juris" (d. 1348), and by Cardinal Jean Le Moine (Joannes Monachus, d. 1313), whose works were often printed.

<p>When authors speak of the "closing" of the "Corpus Juris", they do not mean an act of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> for bidding canonists to collect new documents, much less forbidding themselves to add to the ancient collections. But the canonical movement, so active after Gratian's time, has ceased forever. External circumstances, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>, the troubles of the fifteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, were unfavourable to the compiling of new canonical collections; but there were more direct causes. The special object of the first collections of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> was to help settle the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which the canonists of Bologna were trying to systematize; that is why they contain so many specific decisions, from which the authors gathered general principles; when these had been ascertained the specific decisions were of no use except for <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>; and in fact the "Sextus", the "Clementinae", and the other collections contain texts only when they are the statement of a general law. Any changes deemed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> could be made in teaching without the necessity of recasting and augmenting the already numerous and massive collections.
<h3 id="F">From the Decretals to the present time</h3>

<p>After the fourteenth century, except for its contact with the collections we have just treated of, canon law loses its unity. The actual law is found in the works of the canonists rather than in any specific collection; each one gathers his texts where he can; there is no one general collection sufficient for the purpose. It is not a case of confusion, but of isolation and dispersion. The sources of law later than the "Corpus Juris" are: <ul><li>the decisions of councils, especially of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1545-1563), which are so varied and important that by themselves they form a short code, though without much order; <li>the constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, numerous but hitherto not officially collected, except the "Bullarium" of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1747); <li>the Rules of the Apostolic Chancery; <li>the 1917 Code of Canon Law; <li>lastly the decrees, decisions, and various acts of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> rather than law properly so called.</ul> For local law we have provincial councils and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> there have been published collections of councils and Bullaria. Several <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> have also had their acts collected in official publications; but these are rather erudite compilations or repertories.

<p>The method followed, both by private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, in drawing up canonical collections is generally rather that of a coordinated compilation or juxtaposition of documents than codification in the modern sense of the word, i.e. a redaction of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> (all the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>) into an orderly series of short precise texts. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that antiquity, even the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, did not offer any model different from that of the various collections, that method, however, long since ceased to be useful or possible in canon law. After the "closing" of the "Corpus Juris" two attempts were made; the first was of little use, not being official; the second, was official, but was not brought to a successful issue. In 1590 the jurisconsult Pierre Mathieu, of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. published under the title "Liber septimus" a supplement to the "Corpus Juris", divided according to the order of the books and titles of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>. It includes a selection of papal constitutions, from <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> to <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> (1471-1590), but not the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. This compilation was of some service, and in a certain number of editions of the "Corpus Juris" was included as an appendix. As soon as the official edition of the "Corpus Juris" was published in 1582, <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> appointed a commission to bring up to date and complete the venerable collection. <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> hastened the work and at length Cardinal Pinelli presented to <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> what was meant to be a "Liber septimus". For the purpose of further studies the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had it printed in 1598: the <a href="../cathen/04321a.htm">pontifical constitutions</a> and the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> were inserted in it in the order of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>. For several reasons <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> refused to approve this work and the project was definitively abandoned. Had this collection been approved it would have been as little used today as the others, the situation continuing to grow worse.

<p>Many times during the nineteenth century, especially at the time of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (Collectio Lacensis, VII, 826), the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had urged the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to draw up a complete collection of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in force, adapted to the needs of the day. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, their requests were complied with in regard to certain matters; <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> in his "Motu proprio" of 19 March, 1904, refers to the constitution <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolicae Sedis"</a> limiting and cataloguing the censures "latae sententie", the Constitution "Officiorum", revising the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Index; the Constitution "Conditre" on the religious congregations with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. These and several other documents were, moreover, drawn up in short precise articles, to a certain extent a novelty, and the beginning of a codification. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius</a> later officially ordered a codification, in the modern sense of the word, for the whole canon law. In the first year of his pontificate he issued the <a href="../cathen/10602a.htm">Motu Proprio</a> "Arduum", (De Ecclesiae legibus in unum redigendis); it treats of the complete codification and reformation of canon law. For this purpose the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> requested the entire episcopate, grouped in provinces, to make known to him the reforms they desired. At the same time he appointed a commission of consultors, on whom the initial work devolved, and a commission of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, charged with the study and approval of the new texts, subject later to the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>. The plans of the various titles were confided to canonists in every country. The general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Code that followed includes (after the preliminary section) four main divisions: <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, things (with subdivisions for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, sacred places and objects, etc.). trials, crimes and penalties. It is practically the plan of the "Institutiones", or manuals of canon law. The articles were numbered consecutively. This great work was finished in 1917.

<h2 id="vi">Ecclesiastical law</h2>

<p>The sources of canon law, and the canonical writers. give us, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, rules of action, each with its specific object. We have now to consider all these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in their common abstract element, in other words Ecclesiastical Law, its characteristics and its practice. According to the excellent definition of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/2090.htm#article1">I-II:90:1</a>) a law is a reasonable ordinance for the common good <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the head of the community. Ecclesiastical law therefore has for its author the head of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community over which he has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> strictly so called; its object is the common welfare of that community, although it may cause inconvenience to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>; it is adapted to the obtaining of the common welfare, which implies that it is physically and morally possible for the majority of the community to observe it; the legislator must intend to bind his subjects and must make known that intention clearly; finally he must bring the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> under the notice of the community. A law is thus distinguished from a counsel, which is optional not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>; from a precept, which is imposed not on the community but on individual members; and from a regulation or direction, which refers to accessory matters.

<p>The object therefore of ecclesiastical law is all that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> or useful in order that the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> may attain its end, whether there be question of its organization, its working, or the acts of its individual members; it extends also to temporal things, but only indirectly. With regard to acts, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> obliges the individual either to perform or to omit certain acts; hence the distinction into "affirmative or preceptive" <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and "negative or prohibitory" <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; at times it is forced to allow certain things to be done, and we have "permissive" <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of forbearance; finally, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in addition to forbidding a given act may render it, if performed, null and void; these are "irritant" <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Laws in general, and irritant <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in particular, are not retroactive, unless such is expressly declared by the legislator to be the case. The publication or <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has a double aspect: law must be brought to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the community in order that the latter may be able to observe it, and in this consists the publication. But there may be legal forms of publication, requisite and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and in this consists the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> properly so called (see <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">PROMULGATION</a>). Whatever may be said about the forms used in the past, today the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of general ecclesiastical laws is effected exclusively by the insertion of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in the official publication of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the "Acta Apostolical Sedis", in compliance with the Constitution "Promulgandi", of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 29 September, 1908, except in certain specifically mentioned cases. The law takes effect and is binding on all members of the community as soon as it is <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, allowing for the time morally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for it to become known, unless the legislator has fixed a special time at which it is to come into force.

<p>No one is presumed to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; only <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of fact. not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of law, is excusable (Reg. 1:3 jur. in VI). Everyone subject to the legislator is bound in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to observe the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. A violation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, either by omission or by act, is punishable with a penalty (q.v.). These penalties may be settled beforehand by the legislator, or they may be left to the discretion of the judge who imposes them. A violation of the moral law or what one's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> judges to be the moral law is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; a violation of the exterior penal law, in addition to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, renders one liable to a punishment or penalty; if the will of the legislator is only to <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> the offender to submit to the penalty, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is said to be "purely penal"; such are some of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> adopted by civil legislatures, and it is generally admitted that some ecclesiastical laws are of this kind. As <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is the gate of entrance to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, all those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, even non-Catholics, are in principle subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; in practice the question arises only when certain acts of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics come before <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> tribunals; as a general rule an irritant law is enforced in such a case, unless the legislator has exempted them from its observance, for instance, for the form of marriage. General <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> therefore, bind all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> wherever they may be. In the case of particular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as one is subject to them in virtue of one's domicile, or even quasi-domicile, passing strangers are not subject to them, except in the case of acts performed within the territory.

<p>The role of the legislator does not end with the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; it is his office to explain and interpret it (<em>declaratio, interpretatio legis</em>). The interpretation is "official" (<em>authentica</em>) or even "necessary", when it is given by the legislator or by some one authorized by him for that purpose; it is "customary", when it springs from usage or habit; it is "doctrinal", when it is based on the authority of the learned writers or the decisions of the tribunals. The official interpretation alone has the force of law. According to the result, the interpretation is said to be "comprehensive, extensive, restrictive, corrective," expressions easily understood. The legislator, and in the case of particular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the superior, remains master of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>; he can suppress it either totally (abrogation), or partially (derogation), or he can combine it with a new law which suppresses in the first law all that is incompatible with the second (abrogation). Laws co-exist as far as they are reconcilable; the more recent modifies the more ancient, but a particular law is not suppressed by a general law, unless the fact is stated expressly. A law can also cease when its purpose and end cease, or even when it is too difficult to be observed by the generality of the subjects; it then falls into desuetude (see CUSTOM).

<p>In every <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, but especially in a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> so vast and varied as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is impossible for every law to be applicable always and in all cases. Without suppressing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, the legislator can permanently exempt from it certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or certain groups, or certain matters, or even extend the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of certain subjects; all these concessions are known as <a href="../cathen/12437a.htm">privileges</a>. In the same manner the legislator can derogate from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in special cases; this is called a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. Indults or the powers that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world receive from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, to regulate the various cases that may arise in the administration of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, belong to the category of privileges; together with the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> granted directly by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, they eliminate any excessive rigidity of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and ensure to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation a marvellous facility of application. Without imperilling the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and prerogatives of the legislator, but on the contrary strengthening them, <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> impress more strongly on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that humane, broad, merciful character, mindful of the welfare of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but also of human weakness, which likens it to the moral law and distinguishes it from civil legislation, which is much more external and inflexible.

<h2 id="vii">The principal canonists</h2>

<p>It is impossible to draw up a detailed and systematic catalogue of all the works of special value in the study of canon law; the most distinguished canonists are the subject of special articles in this Encyclopedia. Those we have mentioned as commentators of the ancient canonical collections are now of interest only from an historical point of view; but the authors who have written since the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> are still read with profit; it is in their great works that we find our practical canon law. Among the authors who have written on special chapters of the "Corpus Juris", we must mention (the date refers to the first edition of the works): <ul><li><a href="../cathen/05751c.htm">Prospero Fagnani</a>, the distinguished secretary of the Sacred Congregation of the Council, "Jus canonicum seu commentaria absolutissima in quinque libros Decretalium" (Rome, 1661), <li>Manuel Gonz&aacute;lez* T&eacute;llez (d. 1649), "Commentaria perpetua in singulos textus juris canonici" (Lyons, 16, 3); <li>the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Paul Laymann, better known as a <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theologian</a>, "Jus canonicum seu commentaria in libros Decretalium" (Dillingen, 1666); <li><a href="../cathen/06568c.htm">Ubaldo Giraldi</a>, Clerk Regular of the Pious Schools, "Expositio juris pontificii juxta re centiorem Ecclesiae disciplinam" (Rome, 1769). </ul> Among the canonists who have followed the order of the titles of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>: <ul><li>the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/05429a.htm">Louis Engel</a>, professor at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, "Universum jus canonicum secundum titulos libr.

Grand claude, "Jus canonicum" (Paris, 1882).</ul>

<p>The plan of the "Institutiones", in imitation of Lancelotti (Perugia, 1563), has been followed by very many canonists, among whom the principal are: <ul><li>the learned Antonio Agustin, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, "Epitome jurispontificu veteris" (Tarragona, 1587); his "De emendatione Gratiani dialogorum libri duo" (Tarragona, 1587), is worthy of mention; <li>Claude Fleury, "Institution au droit eccl&eacute;siastique" (Paris, 1676); <li>Zeger Bernard van Espen, "Jus ecclesiasticum universum" (Cologne, 1748); <li>the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/13590b.htm">Dominic Schram</a>, "Institutiones juris ecclesiastici" (Augsburg, 1774); <li>Vincenzo Lupoli, "Juris ecclesiastici praelectiones" (Naples, 1777); <li><a href="../cathen/04768b.htm">Giovanni Devoti</a>, titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, "Institutionum canonicarum libri quatuor" (Rome, 1785); his "Commentary on the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>" has only the first three books (Rome, 1803); <li>Cardinal Soglia, "Institutiones juris privati et publici ecclesiastici" (Paris, 1859) and "Institutiones juris publici", (Loreto, 1843); <li>D.

<p>School manuals in one or two volumes are very numerous and it is impossible to mention all. <ul><li>We may cite in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> those of G.C. Ferrari (1847); Vecchiotti (Turin, 1867); De Camillis, (Rome, 1869); Sebastiano Sanguinetti, S.J.

<p>There are also canonists who have written at considerable length either on the whole canon law, or on special parts of it, in their own particular manner; it is difficult to give a complete list, but we will mention: <ul><li><a href="../cathen/02287b.htm">Agostino Barbosa</a> (d. 1639), whose works fill at least 30 volumes; <li>J.B. Cardinal Luca (d. 1683), whose immense "Theatrum veritatis" and "Relatio curiae romance" are his most important works; <li>Pignatelli, who has touched on all practical questions in his "Consultationes canonicae", 11 folio volumes, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, 1668; <li>Prospero Lambertini (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Pope Benedict XIV</a>), perhaps the greatest canonist since the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; <li>in the nineteenth century we must mention the different writings of <a href="../cathen/02711e.htm">Dominique Bouix</a>, 15 volumes, Paris, 1852 sq.; <li>the "Kirchenrecht" of J.

<p>It is impossible to enumerate the special treatises. Among repertoires and dictionaries, it will suffice to cite the "Prompta Bibliotheca" of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06048a.htm">Ludovico Ferraris</a> (Bologna, 1746); the "Dictionnaire de droit canonique" of Durand de Maillane (Avignon, 1761), continued later by Abb&eacute; Andre (Paris, 1847) etc.; finally the other encyclopedias of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> wherein canon law has been treated.
