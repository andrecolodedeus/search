<h1>Canonical Admonitions</h1>  

<p>A preliminary means used by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> towards a suspected <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as a preventive of harm or a remedy of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In the Instruction emanating in 1880, by direction of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, from the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and giving them the privilege to use a summary procedure in trials of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for criminal or disciplinary transgressions, Article IV decrees: "Among the preservative measures are chiefly to be reckoned the spiritual retreat, admonitions, and injunctions"; Article VI: "The canonical admonitions may be made in a paternal and private manner (even by letter or by an intermediary <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>), or in legal form, but always in such a way that <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their having been made shall remain on record."

<p>These admonitions are to be founded upon a suspicion of guilt excited by public rumour, and after an investigation to be made by one having due authority, with the result of establishing a reasonable basis for the suspicion. Upon slender foundation the superior should not even admonish, unless the suspected <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has given on previous occasions serious motive for faultfinding. Admonitions may be either paternal or legal (canonical), If the grounds are such as to produce a serious likelihood, or half-proof, they will suffice for a paternal admonition, which is administered after the following manner: The <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> either personally or through a confidential delegate informs the suspected <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of what has been said about him, without mentioning the source of information, and without threat, but urges amendment. If the party suspected can at once show that there is no basis for suspicion, nothing further is to be done in the matter. If his denial does not banish the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> about him, the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> should try by persuasion, exhortation, and beseechings to induce him to avoid whatever may be a <a href="../cathen/11196a.htm">near occasion of wrong</a>, and to repair the harm or <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> given. If this is not effective, the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> may begin the judicial procedure. If the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> at hand are inadequate, this is not advisable; he should rather be content with watchfulness, and with using negative penalties, such as withholding special offices and, where no slur could be manifest on the suspect's reputation, by withdrawing those before held. If the suspect does not answer to the summons, the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate's</a> suspicion reasonably increases, and he should then depute a reliable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to seek an interview with him, and to report to him the result. If he should refuse to deal with the delegate, the latter in the name of the delegating <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> should through another or by letter send a second and a third peremptory call, and give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the further refusal, with evidence that the summons has been received; now the suspect is presumed guilty. Thus the way is paved for the above-mentioned canonical or legal admonition. The assumed half-proof is strengthened, first, by the <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a> of the suspect; secondly, by his confession of the charge in question. An accusation issuing from a reliable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as also a prevalent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> reputation, may supply for the defect of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> needed for indictment. For the paternal admonition it is enough that this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> reputation should be spread among less responsible <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but for the legal admonition the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> reputation should emanate from serious and reliable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The legal admonition is to a great extent akin to the summons to judgment. It is always desirable for the suspect, and for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> should arrange the matter quietly and amicably. Hence he should, by letter or through a delegate whose authority is made known, summon the suspect, informing him that a serious charge has been made against him. The summons, if not responded to, should be made a second and a third time. If contumacious, the suspect gives ample ground for an indictment. If there be any urgency in the case, one peremptory summons, declaring it to take the place of the three, will suffice. The <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> may still feel that he has not enough evidence to prove the delinquency. He may allow the suspect to purge himself of the suspicion or accusation by his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> and the attestation of two or more reliable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that they are persuaded of his innocence and that they trust his word. If he cannot find such vouchers for his innocence, and yet there be no strictly legal <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his guilt (though there are grave reasons for suspicion), the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> may follow the legal admonition by a special precept or command, according to the character of the suspected delinquency. The infringement of this precept will entail the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to inflict the penalty which should be mentioned at the time the command is given. This must be done by the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> or his delegate in a formal legal way before two witnesses and the notary of his <em>curia</em>, be signed by them, and by the suspect if he so desires. The paternal admonition is to be kept secret; the legal admonition is a recognized part of the "acts" for future procedure.
