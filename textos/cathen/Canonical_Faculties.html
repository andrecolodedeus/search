<h1>Canonical Faculties</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Facultates</em>)

<p>In law, a faculty is the authority, privilege, or permission, to perform an act or function. In a broad sense, a faculty is a certain power, whether based on one's own right, or received as a favour from another, of validly or lawfully doing some action. In a more restricted sense, it means the conferring on a subordinate, by a superior who enjoys <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the external forum, of certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which are denied him by <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>; to act, namely, in the external or internal forum validly or lawfully, or at least safely. Faculties, then, will be classified, first of all, by reason of the object to which they relate, inasmuch as; &mdash; <ol><li>jurisdiction is granted to absolve from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures, to dispense in <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, in irregularities relating to the reception of orders, in matrimonial impediments; <li>permission or licence is given to do something which would be otherwise forbidden, as the reading of prohibited books, saying two Masses on the same day; ordaining <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> under the prescribed age; <li>to avoid worry and qualms of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> a precautionary <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> or permission is granted to proceed in certain cases in relation to which the opinions of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> may not appear sufficiently well founded, as for instance, a matrimonial <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> may be conceded as a precaution, when it is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that an impediment exists, or permission to anticipate at 2 p.m. the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> is granted to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is unwilling to accept the opinion that anticipation at that hour is lawful.</ol>

<p>Secondly, faculties, by reason of their source, are Apostolic, episcopal, or regular. Faculties are styled Apostolic or <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> when they proceed from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> directly, or through the ordinary channels of the Sacred <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>. They are episcopal, if the power or privilege conferred proceeds from a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, by virtue of his own power or ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, as for instance, the faculties of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, to hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, preach, etc., granted to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who labour in the diocese for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Faculties are regular when they proceed from superiors of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by reason of their ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, or by virtue of extraordinary powers or privileges conceded to them by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Lastly, faculties are general or particular: general, when granted for indeterminate <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, though they may be limited by time; particular, when granted to designated <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or for particular cases. General faculties conceded to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and other ordinaries are also called <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a>.

<p>The distance of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, together with peculiar local conditions, render the granting of these general faculties a matter of necessity, and in 1637 certain new grants or lists of faculties were drawn up by the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, and since then have been communicated by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propagation of the Faith</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, vicars and prefects Apostolic throughout the world, according to their various needs. These <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> are given for a definite period, e.g. five years (<em>facultates quinquennales</em>), or for a definite number of cases, and are ordinary and extraordinary; the former being issued in forms or grants under Roman numerals (Formula I, II, III . . . . X), some of the latter under capital letters (Formula A, B, C, etc.), others under small letters (Formula a, b, c), while others, finally, without special designation, begin: "In an audience with His Holiness". Formul&aelig; V, VII, VIII, IX are no longer in use. It has been the practice to communicate to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> grants I, C, D, and E. Of late, however, C, D, and E, with certain modifications, are combined in form T. Favours and privileges are granted likewise by the congregations in keeping with the Constitution "Sapienti Consilio" (1908), and are classified consequently in accordance with the Congregation from which they proceed. The authority of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> is not so ample in this matter as formerly, and this too in relation to countries still subject to it. Questions pertaining to the Pauline Privilege fall in every case under the sole competency of the Holy Office, while in matrimonial <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, for the portions of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> under its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confer with the Congregation of the Sacraments (Cong. of the Consistory, 7 Jan., 1909). Especially through the Sacred P&oelig;nitentiaria does the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> communicate faculties for the internal forum to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and others, including certain confessors, in definite forms or leaflets (<em>pagell&oelig;</em>).

<p>Graces thus received from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> do not restrict the prerogatives which the one favoured may already enjoy by virtue of ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> or other title (<em>gratia non nocet grati&oelig;</em>). The purpose of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is to make a concession, not to lessen one's authority. Hence, for example, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is authorized by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> to dispense his subjects from the observance of the intervals prescribed in the reception of orders; consequently he is not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to observe the condition laid down in Form I, art. xxix, which forbids him to use this faculty in favour of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> actually outside the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> territory. While the recent legislation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has sought to prevent conflict of authority between the various <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, tribunals and offices, yet it will happen at times that two or more of these bodies will have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the same case.



<p>A petition which has been rejected by one of the congregations may not be presented lawfully to another; a favour granted by another congregation, the previous refusal of the grant being concealed, is null and void. A petition in writing is not required for validity, but is usually exacted; the same may be said of application by telegraph or telephone. The form of the supplication is not prescribed except in so far as requisite data must be expressed. Petitions addressed to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of most of the congregations, at least to expedite matters), should be in Latin, Italian, or French. The Sacred P&oelig;nitentiaria will accept communications in any modern tongue. The supplication is made out in the name of the petitioner, but the <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> is sent to the ordinary. The <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">diocesan chancery office</a> usually deals directly with the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the parties concerned.

<p>Faculties can only be used in favour of members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who are not disqualified by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties or censures. Hence in marriage cases where one of the contracting parties is a non-Catholic, the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is given directly to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Hence also in Apostolic <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from penalties and censures, as far as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a>, to be effective, is first given. Apostolic faculties granted to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, which imply an act of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in using them, can be communicated and applied only to the subjects of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and to such determinate <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as are capable of receiving the favour given by means of this faculty. Ordinarily faculties may be exercised in behalf of a subject, while both he and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> making the concession, are outside their own territory. When the use of faculties is restricted to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as in Forms I and C, it means that the subject, not the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, must be in the diocese when the <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> is made use of in his behalf. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> any matrimonial <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> may be conceded to one actually outside his own diocese, if be has not acquired at least a quasi-domicile elsewhere (Holy Office per <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, 20 Dec., 1894). To dispense validly and lawfully by virtue of an <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a>, a just cause existing at the time of the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> is required. He who possesses general delegated power may apply it to himself, e.g. dispensing himself from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. There is an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, to be measured by the greater or less urgency of the case, of using faculties possessed. It might be noted that the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> at Washington, in common with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, has possessed the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> Forms I, C, D, and E, together with some others, applicable of course throughout the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. his Excellency, aside from territorial extension, possesses no greater powers in regard to matrimonial <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> than these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot dispense without a special faculty, when two or more matrimonial impediments, diriment or otherwise, exist in the same case, or affect the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, though by reason of <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> he can dispense separately in each of the impediments involved. This restriction, however, holds good only when the impediments in question are generically different, e.g. <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> and affinity, or where the power to dispense is given in different <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a>. The special faculty covering the cumulation of matrimonial impediments is usually granted with the renewal of faculties and is effective during the duration of the same. The form of this special faculty is not always identical, greater or more restricted powers being contained therein. Moreover, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot employ this faculty when he is granting by virtue of an <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> a retroactive <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to render a marriage valid (<em>sanatio in radice</em>). This question of cumulation affects <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> only, not absolutions: a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> inflicts a wound on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, not so an <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for validity that the concession of a favour be made known to the one benefited; and it ought to be applied in such manner that its execution may be established. As faculties depend upon the will of the grantor, the terms of the <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> must be carefully studied, and obscure passages rightly interpreted. In this matter the general rules for the interpretation of law are to be observed with some additional ones. Hence in the use of faculties it must be noted whether power to dispense is granted for matrimonial alliances already contracted, or not yet contracted, or for both. A faculty granted for the internal forum only, particularly if jurisdictional, cannot be used in the external forum, and vice versa. Faculties are not to be extended to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or cases not included in the same. The existing practice, especially of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> (<em>stylus curi&oelig; Roman&oelig;</em>), will serve as a guide in this matter.

<p>Faculties expire by the death of the grantor, his removal from office or loss of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> (certain distinctions, however, are to be borne in mind, as below); by the death of the privileged one; by lapse of time, when they are granted for a definite period; when they have been used for the number of cases specified in the grant; by revocation; by renunciation duly accepted; by the completion of the business for which one has received special authorization; by cessation of the formal cause on which the favour was based. Faculties granted absolutely (not revocable at will) by one possessing ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and <em>grati&oelig; fact&oelig;</em> (i.e., the delegate is a <em>necessary</em> executor), do not expire at the death of the grantor; <em>grati&oelig; faciend&oelig;</em> (i.e. the delegate is a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> executor, viz, commissioned to act, if he judge it expedient) cease at the death of the grantor, when no steps have as yet been taken leading to the concession requested (<em>re adhuc integr&acirc;</em>); otherwise they do not cease. Faculties granted by one enjoying delegated power cease at the death of the one delegating, unless the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> expressly provides for their continuance, or unless the matter in question has already been begun (<em>re non integr&acirc;</em>). The power given personally to a delegate, or subdelegate, expires at his death, which is not the case if he is chosen by reason of his dignity or office. When it is stated that faculties are "revocable at our will or judgment", they expire with the death of the grantor; when given in the name of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, etc., they continue in force after the death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, etc. Indults consequently found in the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> forms or other general grants as above, since they are <em>grati&oelig; fact&oelig;</em>, do not become ineffective at the death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>: the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the faculties conceded by the Sacred P&oelig;nitentiaria, when the prefect of that tribunal loses his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> through death or other cause. Jurisdiction granted by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to hear the confession of an individual ceases, <em>re adhuc integr&acirc;</em>, when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> dies, is transferred, or resigns: the contrary is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, when <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is given to hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> in general. Notwithstanding the revocation of faculties, a case already begun may be completed; and by a general revocation of faculties special faculties do not expire. Neglect to use a favour does not destroy its force, as for example, a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> dispensed from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or the recitation of the Holy Office does not lose the grace, if he meanwhile fast or recite the Office, even for a considerable time.

<p>All special faculties granted habitually (<em>habitualiter</em>), by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and others enjoying ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> within definite territorial limits, remain in force notwithstanding the loss of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> through death or other cause of the individual to whom they are granted (Cong. Holy Office, 24 Nov., 1897), but pass on to his successor in the same office. They are considered not personal but real favours, granted to the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> or place, and by the ordinary are understood <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, their vicars-general, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> or prefects Apostolic ruling over territory not subject to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, vicars capitular or other legitimate administrators of vacant sees (Cong. Holy Office, 20 Feb., 1888). It is to be noted that since these <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> are granted to the ordinary, under which appellation is included the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, said <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> uses these faculties, grants <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> and other <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> contained therein, by virtue of authority received directly from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, equivalent to that extended to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may forbid the exercise of these powers, but notwithstanding the prohibition, the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> would act validly, were he to use said faculties, provided nothing else were wanting to render his action invalid. (See JURISDICTION; <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">DELEGATION</a>; <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">RESCRIPTS</a>; <a href="../cathen/05691a.htm">APOSTOLIC EXECUTOR</a>; <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">DISPENSATION</a>.)
