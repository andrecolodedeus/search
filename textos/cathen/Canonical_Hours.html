<h1>Canonical Hours</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Idea</h2>

<p>By canonical hour is understood all the fixed portion of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> appoints to be recited at the different hours. The term was borrowed from the custom of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and passed into the speech of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> we see that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was designated by the hour at which it was said (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs1">Acts 3:1</a>). The observance from being optional having become <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> for certain classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in virtue of canons or ordinances <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, each portion of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> was called a canonical hour, and the whole of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> fixed for a certain day took the name of canonical hours. This term was extended to apply to the book or collection which contained these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, hence the expression "book of hours". The <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> is one of the most ancient documents in which the expression, canonical hours is found; in chapter lxvii we read "ad omnes canonicas horas". It passed into common speech about the next century as may be judged from <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a> ("De ecclesiasticis officiis", I, xix, in P.L. LXXXIII, 757), etc. The article <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">BREVIARY</a> treats the various parts which compose the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, together with their origin and the history of their formation; under each of the words designating them details will be found concerning their composition, the modifications they have undergone, and the questions raised with regard to their origin (see <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">COMPLINE</a>); here we shall deal only with the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of reciting them imposed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on certain classes of people, an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> which recalls, as has been said, the very qualification of canonical.
<h2 id="section2">Obligation of reciting</h2>

<p>After having devoted a few lines to the present <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> on this point, the origin and successive development of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> will be treated at length.
<h3 id="A">Present discipline of the Church</h3>

<p>This is set forth by all moral <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists. They treat more or less extensively of the character of this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, the conditions required for complying with it, and practical instances of infraction or negligence. All modern authors derive their inspiration from <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a> (Theologia Moralis, VI, n. 140 sqq.). The general thesis on the existence of this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom it concerns may be formulated thus: the following are bound each day to the recitation, at least private, of the canonical hours: (a) all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>; (b) all beneficiaries; (c) religious men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who are bound by their rule to the office of choir (Deshayes, "Memento juris ecclesiastici", n. 430). According to the terms of this pronouncement there must be considered (1) the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> character of this recitation; it deals with a precept of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which aims at binding to this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> certain classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom she makes her representatives with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is founded on the virtue of religion; its infraction may be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if the omitted part is notable. (2) The validity of private recitation, but in this case the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who recites it must actually pronounce the words, for it is something more than <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. (3) The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recite the hours: (a) All <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, that is, all who have received the sub-diaconate or one of the superior orders, for, since the twelfth century, the sub-diaconate has been incontestably ranked among <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> (Innocentius III, cap. "Miramur", 7, "de servis non ordinandis"). All are bound unless legitimately dispensed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> even though they are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, suspended, or <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicted</a>. (b) All beneficiaries, that is, all who enjoy a perpetual right to derive revenue from the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by reason of a spiritual charge with which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has invested them, even though they are merely <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsured</a>; this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> binds under pain of losing their right to the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, in proportion to the extent of their omission, conformably to the statute of the Fifth Council of the Lateran (1512-17). (c) Lastly, religious, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, bound by their rule to the office of choir, from the instant they have made solemn profession in an order approved by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>As for the solemnly professed, everyone agrees that they are bound to recite the Office whether in choir, or in private (if they cannot assist at choir), even when they are not yet in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>; this is the meaning of the ancient custom observed in <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and a reply of the Penitentiary has definitively <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> this interpretation (26 November, 1852). But <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> having (17 March, 1857) decreed through the Congregation of Regulars that, in future, solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> should be preceded by a trienniate of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> the question arose whether during this trienniate the religious are bound to the recitation of <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> submitted by the general of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> to the Sacred Congregation on the condition of regulars received a negative reply. This reply, nevertheless, maintained for those religious the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of assisting at choir (6 August, 1858). Whence it follows that for religious with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> exemption from Office bears simply on private recitation when they cannot assist at choir. Such is, in brief, the condition of canonical legislation on the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of reciting the canonical hours in as far as concerns <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.


<h3 id="B">Origins and successive development of this obligation</h3>

<p>(1) The official <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> called in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> "the sacrifice of the lips" was from the early times of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> confided to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> charged with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the whole <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people. It may be said that the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> imposed on a class of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is found in germ in the confiding by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs4">Acts 6:4</a>) to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of the external care of the community, the Apostles themselves reserving the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and evangelical preaching.

<p>(2) We will summarize here the chapters in which <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a> gives the history of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the development of this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> ("Vetus et nova ecclesi&aelig; disciplina", Part I, II, lxxii sqq.; <a href="../cathen/13194a.htm">Roskovany</a> has treated the same subject in "Coelibatus et Breviarium", v, viii, xi, xii). During the first five centuries, although the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> took part daily in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Offices</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were under a stricter <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to assist thereat; if they were prevented by some other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> they were under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to supply the omission by private recitation. Witness for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Orient in the fourth century this text of the Apostolic Constitutions: "Precationes facite mane et tertia hora, ac sexta et nona vespera atque in gallicinio" (VIII, xxxiv, P.G., I, 1135). The same chapter adds that if the assembly could not take place in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> because of the infidels, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should assemble his flock in some private house, and if he could not, each one should discharge this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> either alone or with two or three of his brethren. Thus, says, <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a>, from the infancy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there has been a <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> composed of psalms, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and lessons, this office has been publicly chanted in the churches or <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were charged with presiding at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in union with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were included in the same <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and if prevented from assembling these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> had to be said in private. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> prescriptions of the Council of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> (c. 387) which appear to be borrowed from the Liturgy of Constantinople are an echo of these practices (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>-<a href="../cathen/09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, "Histoire des conciles", I, 994). The <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a>, disciples of <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a> derived inspiration from this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> regarding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (see <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, "Hist. Eccles.", P.G., LXVII, c. 1071; Cassian, "De coenobiorum institutione", P.L., XLIX, c. 82-7).

<p>In this way the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is manifested; if she no longer formulates in precise terms the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> she lets it be understood to what extent she holds them bound. Clerics are by their <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> attached to the service of a church; the principal function of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> in each church is the Mass and public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; this public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> consists in the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. It must be remarked further that the material subsistence of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> is assured them by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a consequence of their <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, but on condition that they assist at <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>; those who fail will have no part in the daily distributions. For the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> the same conclusion is drawn from the manner in which the Fathers express themselves when they speak of public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (see some of their testimony in this respect under <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">BREVIARY</a>). In their eyes, in the measure in which they are formed and developed, the canonical hours are as the attestation and result of the continual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> have so many more reasons for taking an active part, as they have more liberty and leisure, and it is in great measure to this end that an honest livelihood is assured them. From the fifth century councils formulated <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> on this subject with sanctions and penalties; such is the fourteenth canon of a provincial council of the province of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> held at <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, in Brittany, in 465. (Hefele-Leclerq, "Histoire des conciles", II, 905; see also Baumer, "Histoire du Br&eacute;viaire", I, 219. For <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> may be mentioned various decisions of a council held at Toledo about 400. Hefele-Leclerq, op. cit., II, 123.)

<p>(3) Sixth to eighth century.--Decisions multiplied especially in the West <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to celebrate publicly the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. Today the "statuta ecclesi&aelig; antiqua" are most commonly ascribed to the sixth century and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Arles in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, though long attributed to the fourth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (398); canon xlix ordains "that a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> who without being sick fails in the vigils should be deprived of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>" (Hefele-Leclerq, "Histoire des conciles", II, 105). Particular councils followed in great numbers and, while displaying solicitude in establishing uniformity in the order of psalmody and the Office, made regulations for their worthy celebration by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and the other members of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, called upon to supply the insufficiency of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the accomplishment of this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, had likewise to abide by these decisions; indeed, on many occasions they were instrumental in their preparation. Among these councils may be quoted that of <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Agde</a> in 506, that of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> in 516, that of Epaon in 517, etc. In these councils the aim was to follow the Eastern and the Roman usages. The monastic rules had not waited for these rules to promote the worthy celebration of the hours; it is known what importance St. Benedict attached to what he called the Divine work <em>par excellence:</em> "Nihil operi Dei pr&aelig;ponatur", we read in ch. xliii. This sketch of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to take part in the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> may be concluded by citing the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by Emperor Justinian I in 528; "Sancimus ut omnes clerici per singulas ecclesias constituti per seipsos nocturnas et matutinas et vespertinas preces canant" (Kriegel and Hermann, "Corpus juris civilis", Leipzig, II, 39).

<p>As to the private recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a> ("Vetus et nova ecclesi&aelig; disciplina", part I, II, lxxiii sqq.) gives the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> which establish its <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> character as early as the fifth century for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; <a href="../cathen/06724b.htm">Grancolas</a> in "Commentarius historicus in Breviarum romanum" relies on the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. For what concerns <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, we have a more certain testimony in the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>. Ch. l prescribes that those who work outdoors or who are travelling should accomplish <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> work at the hour appointed, and in whatever place they are, to the best of their ability. Therefore, they were merely dispensed from the lessons, but recited by heart the psalms, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and shorter <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Dom Ruinart (Preface to works of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, P.L., LXXI, 36-40) assures us that in the works of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> are to be found attesting the fidelity of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of every degree to the recitation of the hours in private when they could not assist at public Office. These <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> did not consider themselves free to omit this recitation.
