<h1>Canonical Inquisition</h1>  

<p>Canonical Inquisition is either extra-judicial or judicial: the former might be likened to a coroner's inquest in our <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>; while the latter is similar to an investigation by the grand jury. An extra-judicial inquiry, which is recommended in civil cases, is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in criminal matters, except the case be <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may not even admonish canonically a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> supposedly delinquent without having first instituted a summary inquest &mdash; "summaria facti cognitio"; "informatio pro informatione curi&aelig;" &mdash; into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the rumours, denunciations, or accusations against said cleric. This examination is conducted by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> personally, or by another ecclesiastic, prudent, trustworthy, and impartial, deputed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as secretly and discreetly as possible, without judicial form. This, however, does not preclude the examination of witnesses or experts, for example, to discover irregularities in the records or accounts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Great caution is to be observed in this preliminary inquiry, lest the reputation of the cleric in question suffer unnecessarily, in which case the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> might be sued for damages. The acts with the result of the inquisition, if any evidence has been found, should be preserved in the archives; if evidence is wanting or is only slight, the acts should be destroyed.

<p>The outcome of the preliminary investigation will be to leave matters as they are; or to proceed to extra-judicial corrective measures; or to begin a public action, when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot be otherwise remedied. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> judgment in this matter is paramount; for, even when a crime may be satisfactorily proven, it may be more beneficial to religion and the interests at stake not to prosecute. In matters of correction proper, in which medicinal penalties are employed, judicial action is barred by limitation in five years. The second inquisition is for the information of the auditor or judge, a judicial inquiry, being the beginning of the strictly judicial procedure &mdash; "processus informativus"; "inquisitio pro informando judice". If sufficient warrant for a judicial trial exist, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> will order his public prosecutor (<em>procurator fiscalis</em>) to draw up and present the charge. Having received the charge, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> will appoint an auditor to conduct the informative procedure, in which all the evidence bearing on the case, for the defence as well as for the prosecution, is to be obtained. This inquest consequently comprises offensive and defensive proceedings, for the auditor is to arrive at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and not conduct the inquiry on the supposition that the defendant is guilty.

<p>When the auditor, assisted by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> prosecutor, has procured all the evidence available for the prosecution, he will open the defensive proceedings with the citation of the accused. The accused must appear in person (see CONTUMACY) for examination by the auditor: the fiscal prosecutor may be present. He is not put under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and is granted perfect freedom in defending himself, proving his innocence, justifying his conduct, alleging mitigating or extenuating circumstances. All declarations, allegations, exceptions, pleas etc., of the defendant are recorded by the clerk in the acts. They are read to the defendant and corrected, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, or additions made. Finally, the accused, if willing, the auditor, and the secretary should sign the acts. A stay must be granted the accused if he demand it, to present a defence in writing. This inquiry may open up new features, to investigate which stays may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The accused must be heard in his own defence after this new inquiry. When satisfied that the investigation is complete, the auditor will declare the inquest closed, and make out an abstract of the results of same. This abstract together with all the acts in the case are given to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> prosecutor. Thus ends the judicial inquisition.
