<h1>Canonical Institution</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>institutio</em>, from <em>instituere</em>, to establish)

<p>In its widest signification, Canonical Institution denotes any manner, in accordance with canon law, of acquiring an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> (Regula prima juris, in VIto). In its strictest sense the word denotes the collation of an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> by a legitimate authority, on the presentation of a candidate by a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (<em>institutio tituli collativa</em>). The term is used also for the actual putting in possession of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> (<em>institutio corporalis</em>), and for the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> requisite for the exercising of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ministry when an authority inferior to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has power to confer an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> (<em>institutio auctorisabilis</em>). (Cf. gloss on "Regula prima juris", in VIto, s.v. "Beneficium".)
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>The <em>institutio tituli collativa</em> (that which gives the title), sometimes also called <em>verbalis</em> (which may be by word of mouth or by writing, as distinguished from the <em>institutio corporalis</em>, or <em>realis</em>), is the act by which an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority confers a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> on a candidate presented by a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> enjoying the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a>. This occurs in the case of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> subject to the right of patronage (<em>jus patronatus</em>), one of the principal prerogatives of which is the right of presenting to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> a titular for a vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. It also occurs when, in virtue of a privilege or of a concordat, a chapter, a sovereign, or a government has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to present to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the titular of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> or of an important <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office. If the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> accepts the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> presented, he bestows the institutio canonica on the titular, The effect of this act is to give the candidate who has been presented (and who till then had only a <em>jus ad rem</em>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to be provided with the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>) a <em>jus in re</em> or <em>in beneficio</em>, i, e. the right of exercising the functions connected with the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> and of receiving revenues accruing from it. The right of institution to major <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> rests in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but in the case of minor <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> it may belong to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, to a <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>, or even to other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, in virtue of a foundation title <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from before the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess, XIV, "de Ref.", c. xii), or of a privilege, or of prescription. In all these cases the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to examine the candidate, excepting candidates presented by <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> recognized canonically (Council of Trent, Sess. VII, "de Ref.", c. xiii; Sess. XXV, "de Ref.", c. ix); even this exception does not apply to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (Council of Trent, Sess. XXIV, "de Ref.", c. xviii). Institution ought to be bestowed within the two months following the presentation, in the case of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches (Constitution of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, "In conferendis", 16 March, 1567), but canon law has not specified any fixed time with regard to other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. However, if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> refuses to grant institution within the time appointed by a superior authority, the latter can make the grant itself (see JUS PATRONATUS).
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>The <em>institutio corporalis</em>, also called <em>investitura</em>, or <em>installatio</em>, is the putting of a titular in effective possession of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. Whereas canon law permits a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to put himself in possession of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> (see <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">ENTHRONIZATION</a>), in the case of minor <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> it requires an actual installation by a competent authority. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may punish any one who takes possession of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> on his own authority, and the violent occupation of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> in possession of another ecclesiastic entails on the guilty party the loss of all right to that <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. The right of installation formerly belonged to <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>, but is now reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, or his delegate, ordinarily the dean (<em>decanus christianitatis</em> or <em>foraneus</em>). It is performed with certain symbolical ceremonies, determined by local usage or by <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, such, for instance, as a solemn entry into the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and into the church, the handing over of the church keys, a putting in possession of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the church, the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, confessional, etc. In some countries there is a double installation: the first by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, either by mere word of mouth, or by some symbolical <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, as, for instance, presenting a <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a>; the second, which is then a mere <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, taking place in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and consisting in the solemn entry and other formalities dependent on local custom. In some places custom has even done away with the <em>institutio corporalis</em> properly so called; the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> inherent to the putting in possession are acquired by the new titular to the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> by a simple visit to his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, for instance, to his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, with the intention of taking possession thereof, provided such visit is made with the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, thus precluding the possibility of self-investiture. When the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> names the titular to a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, he always mentions those who are to put the beneficiary in possession.

<p>The following are the effects of the institutio corporalis: <ul><li>From the moment he is put in possession the beneficiary receives the revenues of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. <li>He enjoys all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> resulting from the ownership and the possession of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, and, in particular, it is from this moment that the time <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a prescriptive right to the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> counts. <li>The possessor can invoke in his favour the provisions of rules 35 and 36 of the Roman Chancery <em>de annali</em>, and <em>de triennali possessione</em>. This privilege has lost much of its importance since the conferring of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> is now a matter of less dispute than in former times. Formerly, on account of various privileges, and the constant intervention of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the collation of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, several <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were not infrequently named to the same <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. Should one of them happen to have been in possession of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> for a year, it would devolve on the rival claimant to prove that the possessor had no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>; moreover, the latter was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to begin his suit within six months after his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the trial was to be concluded within a year counting from the day when the actual possessor was cited to the courts (rule 35 of the Chancery). These principles are still in force. The triennial possession guaranteed the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> to the actual incumbent in all actions <em>in petitorio</em> or <em>in possessorio</em> to obtain a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> brought by any claimant whatsoever (rule 36 of the Chancery). <li>The peaceful possession of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> entails <em>ipso facto</em> the vacating of any <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> to which the holder is a titular, but which would be incompatible with the one he holds. <li>It is only from the day when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> enter into possession of their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> that they can validly assist at marriages celebrated in the diocese or in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> (<a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Ne temere", 2 August, 1907). Furthermore, in some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> declare invalid any exercise of the powers of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> attached to a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, before the actual installation in the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>.</ul>
<h2 id="section3">III</h2>

<p>The <em>institutio auctorisabilis</em> is nothing but an <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> required for the validity of acts of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, granted by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to a beneficiary in view of his undertaking the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> (<em>cura animarum</em>). It is an act of the same nature as the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> which a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives members of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order for hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> not subject to their authority, and without which the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> would be invalid; but there is this difference that in the case of the <em>institutio auctorisabilis</em> the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> relates to the exercise of the ministerial functions taken as a whole. It is the <em>missio canonica</em> indispensable for the validity of acts requiring an actual <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>. This institution, which is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and to those possessing a quasi-episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, is required when the <em>institutio tituli collativa</em> belongs to an inferior <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, a chapter, or a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The <em>institutio tituli collativa</em> given by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself implies the <em>institutio auctorisabilis</em>, which, therefore, needs not to be given by a special act.
