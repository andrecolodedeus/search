<h1>Canonical Visitation</h1>  

<p>The act of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior who in the discharge of his office visits <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or places with a view of maintaining <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and discipline, and of correcting abuses by the application of proper remedies. Such visitation is incumbent on the shepherd who would properly feed and guard his flock. This practice, in vogue from early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times, had somewhat fallen into desuetude when re-established by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in these words: Patriarchs, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shall not fail to visit their respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> either personally, or if they be lawfully impeded, by their <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> or visitor; if unable on account of its extent to make the visitation of the whole diocese annually, they shall visit at least the greater part thereof, so that the whole shall be completed within two years, either by themselves or their visitors. Of the purpose of visitation the Council says: But the principal object of all the visitations shall be to lead men to sound and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> by banishing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, to maintain good <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and to correct such as are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; by admonition and exhortation to animate the people to religion, peace, and innocence, and to put in vogue whatever else may be dictated by the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the visitors for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, as time, place and opportunity shall permit.

<p>The right of visitation belongs to all <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who have ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the external forum. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> through his delegates may institute a visitation throughout the world, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, vicars apostolic, and vicars capitular or administrators of vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in their respective territories, religious superiors within their own <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Prelates <em>nullius</em> enjoy this right in conjunction with the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> in case of disagreement will prevail. Visitation does not, however, fall within the province of a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> unless he be specially commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> is not permitted to visit the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of his suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> save for reasons approved in a provincial synod and then only after the visitation of his own diocese has been completed.

<p>The canonical visitation of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is incumbent on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> personally unless lawfully hindered. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may visit the various parts of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as often as he chooses. According to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> he must do so every year if possible, or at least every two years. Attention is drawn to this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> by the Sacred Congregation of the Consistory (A remotissima, 31 Dec., 1909). The Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> requires a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to visit every part of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> at least once every three years, not only that he may administer the Sacrament of Confirmation, but likewise that he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his people. Associate visitors, men versed in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, are recommended as useful in promoting the end in view. A secretary to do the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> work is generally in attendance. It proves a saving of time and labour if the chancellor or secretary receives in advance answers in writing to the numerous questions compiled, since from the replies it may be seen what particular subjects require a personal investigation. The visitation comprises <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, places, and things. It is an examination into the conduct of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>; into the condition of churches, cemeteries, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, asylums, etc., with their furnishing and appurtenances, into the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, finances, records, state of religion: briefly, it is a complete investigation of the spiritual and temporal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The visitor hears complaints, investigates crimes, sees whether <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and others properly discharge their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and inquires into the private conduct or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Regulars in matters pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> and Divine worship are subject to episcopal visitation and correction. As delegate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may also visit exempt places, but may punish delinquents therein only when the regular superior, being duly notified, fails to do so. Religious communities of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> are visited by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> either by virtue of his own right or as delegate of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>The episcopal visitation should be a paternal investigation of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> matters. Formal trials and judicial penalties consequently will not be common: from such, should they be made use of, a suspensive appeal may be taken. Otherwise an appeal from decrees <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in visitation will beget merely a devolutive effect. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> made should be enforced, and an authentic account of the entire visitation should be preserved in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> archives as an official record, as well as to enable the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his visit <em>ad limina</em> to render to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> an accurate report of conditions in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. This report to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is to be signed not only by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but likewise by one of the associate visitors. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or other visitor, content with hospitality, will accept no offering for the visitation.

<p>The Pontifical prescribes the ceremonies to be observed in a formal visitation of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. At the door of the church the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <em>cappa magna</em> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kisses</a> the crucifix, receives <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a>; then proceeding to the sanctuary he kneels till a prescribed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is sung. Ascending the altar the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives his solemn episcopal blessing. A sermon follows in which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> refers to the purpose of the visitation. Later he imparts the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> that he is empowered to grant. Putting on a black cope and simple <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> recites certain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the deceased <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The procession then proceeds to the cemetery if near by, otherwise to some convenient place in the church where a catafalque shall have been erected: there <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers are offered for all the faithful departed</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is terminated on returning to the sanctuary by still another <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayer for the dead</a>. White vestments being substituted for black, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> examines the tabernacle and contents (blessing the people with the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a>), altars, <a href="../cathen/02274a.htm">baptismal font</a>, sacred oils, confessionals, <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, records, cemetery, edifices, etc. as above. Finally the Pontifical contains other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be said privately before the departure of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his assistants.

<p>Religious superiors also visit canonically institutions and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> subject to them, each observing the Constitution and customs of his own order. The efforts of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> religious superiors in visiting their houses are directed chiefly to promoting <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and discipline; their authority is confined to correcting minor breaches of rule, since they are devoid of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">canonical jurisdiction</a>. Difficulties beyond their power to settle are reported to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or other lawful superior.
