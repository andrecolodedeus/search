<h1>Canons and Canonesses Regular</h1>  

<p>(Also called REGULAR CLERICS, RELIGIOUS CLERICS, CLERIC-CANONS, AUGUSTINIAN CANONS, BLACK CANONS, MONXCANONS).

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, a <em>canon regular</em> is essentially a religious cleric, or, as the same doctor aptly expresses it: "The Order of Canons Regular is necessarily constituted by religious <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, because they are essentially destined to those works which relate to the Divine mysteries, whereas it is not so with the monastic Orders." (II-II:189:8 ad 2um, and II-II:184:8). We have then here what constitutes a canon regular and what distinguishes him from a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state is essential to the Order of Canons Regular, whereas it is only accidental to the Monastic Order. Hence <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, himself a canon regular, declared that the canons regular are a <em>quid medium</em> between the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. And for the same reason Nigellus Vireker, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> in the twelfth century, contrasts the life of canons regular, as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, with that of his own brethren and the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, pointing out the advantages of the former. The canons, he tells us, were spared the long choral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, the sharp reproofs, the stern discipline of the Black Monks, and were not bound to the <a href="../cathen/14209b.htm">Spartan</a> simplicity of vesture and diet of the field-working Cisterians ("Speculum Stultorum", Rolls Series: "The Anglo-Latin Satirical poets of the Twelfth Century"). The "Llanthony Chronicler" relates how the first founders of his famous <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, having consulted among themselves, decided to become canons regular, first, because on account of the charity they were well liked by all, and then because they were satisfied with a modest manner of living, their habit, though clean, being decent, neither too coarse, nor too rich. In this moderation of life we may say that canons regular follow the example of their lawgiver, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, of whom <a href="../cathen/12318a.htm">St. Possidius</a>, his biographer, relates that his habit, his furniture, his clothes were always decent, neither too showy nor too <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and shabby.

<p>The spirit of the canonical order is thus quaintly but clearly explained in the "Observances in Use at the Augustinian Priory at Barnwell, Cambridge," lately edited with a translation by F.W. Clarke: <blockquote> The road along which Canons Regular walk in order to reach the heavenly <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> is the rule of Blessed Augustine. Further lest Canons Regular should wander away from the rule, there are given to them, in addition, observances in accordance with it handed down from remote ages and approved among holy fathers in all quarters of the world. This rule is simple and easy, so that unlearned men and children can walk in it without stumbling. On the other hand it is deep and lofty, so that the wise and strong can find in it matter for abundant and perfect contemplation. An elephant can swim in it and a lamb can walk in it safely. As a lofty tower surrounded on all sides by walls makes the soldiers who garrison it safe, fearless, and impregnable, so the rule of Blessed Augustine, fortified on all sides by observances in accordance with it, makes its soldiers, that is, Canon Regular, undismayed at the attacks, safe and invincible. </blockquote>

<p>To explain further the nature and distinctive spirit of the canonical order, we may say, with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, that a canon regular professes two things, <em>"sanctitatem et clericatum"</em>. He lives in community, he leads the life of a religious, he sings the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the daily recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in choir; but at the same time, at the bidding of his superiors, he is prepared to follow the example of the Apostles by preaching, teaching, and the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, or by giving hospitality to <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and travellers, and tending the sick. And so we find that <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pope Paschal II</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> addressed in 1118 to the prior and community at Colchester, tells them that their order has always been devoted to preaching, hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, and ready to accept the care of such <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> as might be entrusted to their charge. This has been pointed out by other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, as also by <a href="../cathen/08256b.htm">St. Ives</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, and by Cancellieri, who, quoting the authority of an ancient writer to the effect that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> living in common in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a> observed the regulations introduced there by Pope Gelasius, says that "their work was the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the offering of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>." It is the same now. From one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> alone, that of St. Florian, in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, some forty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are served, and those same canons who gave hospitality on the Great St. Bernard serve a number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the Canton Valais. The public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> office, is celebrated with all the splendour befitting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and His house. But the canons regular do not confine themselves exclusively to canonical functions. Nothing, unless incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> is rejected. To this day, as already mentioned, they give hospitality to <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and travelers on the Great St. Bernard and on the Simplon, and in former times the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of St. Bartholomew's Smithfield, in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, of S. Spirito, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, of Lochleven, Monymusk, and St. Andrew's, in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and others like them, were all served by canons regular. In fact, many congregations of canons made it their chief end to work among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, the insane, and the infirm. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> established by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> had a Guest House for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and the sick whom they tended by day and by night. And the rule given by Chrodegang to this canons enjoined that a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> should be near their house that they might tend the sick. The Council of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aix-la-Chapelle</a> (Aachen) also ordains the erection of a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> over which a canon regular is to preside.



<p>The essential and characteristic habit of canons regular is the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a>. With regard to the other parts, their dress, as a general rule, is that of other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, although some have added a <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>. By most the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> is worn as part of their daily dress, though sometimes reduced to a small linen band hanging from the shoulders in front and behind. it is now so worn in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, on the Great St. Bernard, and at <a href="../cathen/01591c.htm">Aosta</a>. As to the colour of the dress there is no fixed rule, the custom and traditions of the various Congregations may be observed. The general colour seems to have been white as now worn by the Lateran Congregation. A question having been raised as to the proper habit of a canon regular, when named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, it was settled by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>. A long dissertation on the dress of the canons regular was presented to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by jurisconsult, Zaccaria Ferreri, who maintained that, with the exception of the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a>, the canons regular, like the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, had no fixed dress. It may be interesting to note that, in this dissertation on the authority of the "Most Reverend Lord Cardinal of England, and many other Prelates, and the English Ambassador", the author says, "in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the Canons Regular wore violet like the other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>." In the Constitutions given by <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a> to canons regular mention is also made of this variety of habit.
<h2>Origin</h2>

<p>Having thus explained what a canon regular is, and what the spirit and work of the canonical order are, it will be easier now to answer such questions as these: <ul> <li>Who was the founder of the canons regular? <li>Whence do they drive their origin? <li>When and where were they first known? </ul> Various and contradictory opinions have been expressed to answer these and similar questions. There have been some writers who, like the famous <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Joachim, Coriolanus, Marquez, and others held that the canonical order began about 1100. According to others the order dates from the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who expressed the wish that all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should be either <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or canons living in common, as prescribed by the Council of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aix-la-Chapelle</a>, in 789, and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, in 813. The great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> is also regarded by some as the founder of the canonical institute. All these opinions are set aside by many other writers, and especially by the historians of the order, who almost unanimously trace back the origin of the canons regular much farther in antiquity. Their institute, they maintain, was founded by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, and dates from the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. These writers and historians begin by saying that, although it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that there was a great revival, or general reformation and spreading of the order in the twelfth century, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and elsewhere through the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Ives</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, in Italy through the newly-founded congregation of Blessed Peter de Honestis, and elsewhere through the congregation of Sts. Rufus, yet this does not imply that the order took its origin at that epoch, but rather &#151; since it needed reforming &#151; that it had already existed for some time. History, in fact, tells us that about the eleventh century the regular or canonical life hitherto observed almost everywhere by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was given up in many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and thus a distinction was made between the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who lived in separate houses and those who still preserved the old discipline, living under rule and having all things in common. The former were called <em>canonici saeculares</em>, the latter <em>canonici regulares</em>, by which name they have been known ever since. It is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in the year 763 Chrodegang, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Metz, assembled the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> around him, led with them a community life, and gave them a rule taken from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of ancient orders and canons, a discipline also recommended shortly after by the Councils of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aix-la-Chapelle</a> and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; but in doing this he was only following the example of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, who had introduced among his own <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the manner of life which he had seen practiced at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. And that is why the member so the canonical order regard St. Augustine not as their founder, but only as their reformer, or lawgiver; because to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who lived with him he had given certain special regulations, which were in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> adopted by almost all the canons regular, who were on that account called "Canons Regular of .htm-->St. Augustine."

<p>Those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Apostolic origin of the canonical institute, support their contention by the authority of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and church historians. There is abundant evidence, they say that Christ Himslef instituted a perfect religious state, and that it was embraced by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and many of their disciples from the very beginning of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is also certain that from the time of the Apostles there have always been in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who, following the example of the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, living "secundum regulam sub sanctis Apostolis constitutam" (according to the Apostolic Rule), had all things in common. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, the historian, relates that St. Mark, the disciple of St. Peter, established this discipline at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, as did St. Crescentius in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/13486b.htm">St. Saturninus</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and St. Maternus in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">St. Eusebius</a> introduced it at <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and St. Amborse at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. <a href="../cathen/15209a.htm">Pope Urban I</a> (A.D. 227), Paschal II (1099), <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> (1334), <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> (1431), <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> in their various Letters and bulls, are quoted by the historians of the order, to prove distinctly that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, only restored, or caused to reflourish, the order of canons regular, which was first instituted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. St. Antoninus, <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a>, Sigebert, Peter of Cluny, <a href="../cathen/05751c.htm">Fagnani</a>, and many others tell us that the canonical order traces back its origin to the earliest ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It will suffice to give here the authority of Francisco Su&aacute;rez, who sums up the case very clearly. After having stated that the Apostles taught by Christ Himslef formed the first order of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and that the order did not perish with the Apostles, but was preserved by continuous succession in their disciples, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by letters of Pope St. Clement and urban I (though these letters are <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidorian</a> in character), the writer continues: <blockquote>We read in the Life of St. Augustine that when he was made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he instituted a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> within the church and began to live with the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to the manner and rules constituted by the holy Apostles. Many therefore suppose that the Order of Regular Clerics, or Canons Regular, was not instituted by St. Augustine, but was either reformed by him or introduced by him into <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and furnished with a special rule. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> maintains that the Order of Regular Clerics was instituted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> confirms in his preface to the Constitutions of the Canons Regular. There is no question as regards the continuance of this state from the time of .htm-->St. Augustine to this time, although with great variety as far as various institutes are concerned. </blockquote>

<p>To this we may add that when a controversy arose between the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and the canons regular with regard to precedence, the question was settled by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> in favour of the canons, on account of their Apostolic origin. We may then conclude with the words of Cardinal Pie, who, addressing the canons regular of the Lateran Congregation, whom he had established at Beauchene in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, says: <blockquote> These that are clothed in white robes, who are they, and whence come they come, I will tell you. heir origin is nothing else but the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and the common life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, the original model of community life between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. On that account they chiefly come from <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> and from the home of Augustine, who has given them a Rule, which they still glory to observe. </blockquote>

<p>The name <em>Austin</em> (or <em>Augustinian</em>) <em>Canons</em> is commonly used instead of <em>Canons Regular</em>, and there are some who think that Austin Canons are so styled because they were instituted by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. This is a wrong notion. St. Augustine did not found the order of canons regular, not even those who are called Austin Canons. There were canons regular before St. Augustine. The various authorities quoted in this article prove it. All St. Austin did was to induce his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to live <em>secundum regulam sub sanctis Apostolis constitutam</em>, which he had seen practised at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, adding to the Apostolic Rule hitherto observed by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> living in common, some regulations, afterwards called the "Rule of St. Augustine." Or, in the words of <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pope Paschal II</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> quoted by Pennott, "Vit&aelig; regularis propositum in primitiva ecclesia cognoscitur ab Apostolis institutum quam B. Augustinus tam gratanter amplexus est ut eam regulis informaret" (A regular mode of life is recognized in the Early Church as instituted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and adopted earnestly by Blessed Augustine, who provided it with new regulations) &#151; <em>Hist. Tripart.</em>, Lib. II, c. iv, 4. These regulations which St. Austin had given to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who lived with him soon spread and were adopted by other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of canons regular in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and elsewhere. When, in and after the eleventh century, the various congregations of canons regular were formed, and adopted the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, they were usually called <em>Canonici Regulares Ordinis S. Augustini Congregationis</em>, and in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> Austin Canons, or Black Canons. but there have always been canons regular who never adopted the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. <a href="../cathen/06568d.htm">Giraldus Cambrenisis</a> mentions some in his day in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In a word, canons regular may be considered as the genus, and Austin Canons as the species; or we may say that all Austin Canons are canons regular, but not all canons regular are Austin canons.

<p>If further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the Apostolic origin of the canonical order are desired, many may be found in the work of Abbot Ceasare Benvenuti (see bibliography at end of this article), who century by century, from councils, Fathers, and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sources, proves that from the first to the twelfth century there had always been <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> living in common according to the example of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. It will be enough to cite here the authority of <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> who, after saying that from the time of the Apostles there have been in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, virgins, <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> named ascetics, continues: <blockquote> At <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">Bp.

Before the gat of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> was a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> under the protection of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>. . .<a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, when a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, founded a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> at <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, in which with other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> he lived in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and community of goods.

Cox, II, 270). </blockquote>

<p>To this again may be added, among many others, the words of <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, in their bulls, all asserting almost in as many words, what has been here said. The following words, taken from the Martyrologium for canons regular and approved by the Congregation of Sacred Rites, will suffice for the purpose: <blockquote> Ordo Canonicorum Regularium, qui in primaevis Ecclesiae saeculis Clerici nominabantur utque ait S. Pius V. in <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>&acirc; (<em>Cum ex ordinum</em> 14 Kal. Jan., 1570): 'ab Apostolis originem traxerunt, quique ab Augustiono eorum Reformatore iterum per reformationis viam mundo geniti fuere', per universum orbem diffusus innumerabilium SS. agmine fulget.

<p>(The order of canons regular, who in the early ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were called <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and who, as <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> says in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Cum ex ordinum</em>, 1570, derived their origin from the Apostles, and who later were born anew to the world through a process of reformation, by their reformer, Augustine, being spread throughout the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, are renowned for an army of innumerable <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>). </blockquote>
<h2>Development</h2>

<p>This rule, which, in the words of <a href="../cathen/06568d.htm">Giraldus Cambrensis</a>, happily joins the canonical and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> life together, was soon adopted by many <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, not only in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, but elsewhere also. After the death of the holy Doctor, it was carried into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by his disciples. One of them, Pope Gelasius, about the year 492, re-established the regular life in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>. From St. John Lateran (the Mother and Mistress of all Churches) the reform spread till at length the Rule was universally adopted by almost all the canons regular. It was in the same Lateran Basilica, tradition tells us, that <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, the future Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, professed the canonical institute which he afterwards introduced with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, into his own country. At the voice of the great apostle the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> nation not only embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but many also, following his example, embraced the canonical life. On the authority of Sir James Ware, Canon Burke (Life and Labours of St. Augustine) asserts that "all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> founded in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, were for canons regular." This opinion is also maintained by Allemande, who affirms (Hist. monastique de l'Irlande) that "the Regular Canons of St. Augustine were so early or considerable in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> before the <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">general suppression of monasteries</a>, that the number of houses they are said to have had seems incredible. They alone possessed, or had been master of, as many houses as all the other orders together, and almost all the chapters of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and collegiate churches in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> consisted of canons regular." To these authorities we might add that of the Rev. R. Butler, who, in his notes to the "Registrum Omnium Sanctorum", expressly affirms that the "old foundations in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> were exclusively for Canons." We might also quote the words of Bishop Thomas de Burgo, who, in his "Hibernia Dominicana", does not hesitate to say that <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> was a canon regular, and that, having preached the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he established there many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the canonical institute. After this no one will think that the same writer exaggerates when he appends to his work a catalogue of 231 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which at some time or other belonged to canons and canonesses regular. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> became the most learned scholars in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland's</a> seats of learning, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunneries</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> were unsurpassed either in number or excellence by those of any nation in the world. The Abbot or Priors of Christ Church and All Hallows in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, of Connell, Kells, Athessel, Killagh, Newton, and Raphoe had seats in Parliament.

<p>There seems very little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the canonical institute was introduced into <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> by St. Columba. This <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, called "monasteriorum pater et fundator," in reference to the numerous churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> built either by him or by his disciples in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, was formed to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Finnian. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, <em>anno</em> 565, relates that Columba, Masspreost (Mass-Priest), "came to the Picts to convert them to Christ", or, as another <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> says: "This year, 565, Columba the Messa-preost, came from the parts of the Scots (<a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>) to the Britons to teach the Picts, and built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the island of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Hy</a>." To what order this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, founded by Columba, belonged, we may judge from other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> built by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. As we have already stated, St. Columba was the disciple of St. Finnian, who was a follower of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>; both then had learned and embraced the regular life which the great Apostle had established in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Moreover, such writers as Ware, de Burgo, Archdall, <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>, Bower, expressly tell us that Columba built <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for canons regular in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. So, for instance, Ware, in his "Antiquitates Hiberniae", writing of Derry, says: "St. Columba built (this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>) for Canons Regular in the year 545." This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was a filiation of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of SS. Peter and Paul at Armagh &#151; which, according to the same writer, had been founded by "St. Patrick for Canons Regular." Again, tradition places the first landing of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> on leaving <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> at Oronsay, and Fordun (Bower) notices the island as "Hornsey, ubi est monasterium nigrorum Canonicorum, quod fundavit S. Columba" (where is the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Black Canons which St. Columba founded). Speaking of the very <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> built by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> at <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Hy</a>, another historian, <a href="../cathen/06536b.htm">Gervase of Canterbury</a>, in his "Mappa Mundi", informs us that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> belonged to the Black Canons.

<p>It may be here the place to mention the opinion of some writers who think that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> established by St. Columba in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> were for Culdees. It will be remembered that numerous opinions have been expressed concerning the origin and the institute of the Culdees, some calling them <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, some secular canons and hospitallers, and others going so far as to say that they were Independents, or Dissenters, nay even the forefathers of the modern <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasons</a>. The present writer, on the other hand, is of opinion that the Culdees originally, and some even to the very end, were nothing else but <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> living in common just as those <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> had established in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and St. Columba had introduced into <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>.

<p>At the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> there were in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> at least thirty-four houses of canons regular and one of canonesses. These included six <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> houses, one Gilbertine, and one of the <a href="../cathen/01555a.htm">Order of St. Anthony</a>. The others seem to have been chiefly of the Aroasian Congregation, first introduced into <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> from Nostall Priory, in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The chief houses were: <ul> <li><em>St. Andrews</em>, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, founded by Angus, King of the Picts. The church was at first served by Culdees, but in 1144 Bishop Robert, who had been a canon regular at Scone, established here members of his own community. The prior was mitred and could pontificate. In Parliament he had precedence of all <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a>. <li><em>Scone</em>, founded by King Alexander I. Here the Scottish kings were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>. The stone on which the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> took place was said to be that on which Jacob rested his head; it is now at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, having been removed by Edward I. Tradition says that the Culdees were at Scone before Alexander brought canons regular from Nostall Priory in 1115. <li><em>Holy Rood</em>, of which <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a> was the founder, in 1128, for canons regular, in the "vail that lyis to the Eist frae the Castell, quhare now lyis the Cannongait, and which at that time was part of ane gret forest full of hartis, hyndis, toddis and sicklike manner of beistis," as <a href="../cathen/02414b.htm">Bellenden</a>, the translator of Bower, expresses it. This famous <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was burnt down, at the instigation of <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">John Knox</a>, in 1544, but some efforts were made to restore Divine service in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> as late as 1688, for in that year Father G. Hay, a Scotch canon regular, of the French congregation, performed there a funeral as he says, "in his habit with <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> and aulmess after the rites of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>." Next the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was the Royal Palace, and we are told that the Scottish kings often went <blockquote> Unto the saintly <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, with good <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to dine And quaff to organ music the pleasant <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> wine. </blockquote></ul> Many of the houses founded by St. Columba remained in possession of the canons till the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Oronsay and Crusay were of the number.

<p>Much valuable information concerning many of the canonical houses may be found in Fordun's Scoti-Chronicon, written before 1384 (ed. Skene, <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, 1871-72). As Walter Bower, its continuator and annotator, was a canon regular, and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Inchcolm, he no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> derived all his materials at firs hand from the archives of the order, and thus many important particulars are related by him concerning the foundations of the houses, their inmates, and particular events.

<p>There are not wanting writers who, on the authority of Jocelin, William of Malmsbury, "Gesta Pontificum", and others, are of opinion that the canonical order was established in Britain by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, on his return from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Be this as it may, the Saxon conquerors of the country extirpated not only the religious establishments, but almost the very Faith of Christ from the land. The faithful either were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to dwell in the fastnesses of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> or were made slaves. It was in these circumstances that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> with forty <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, who according to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugenius IV</a> (quoted by <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a> in his Anglo-Saxon Church, I, iv), by which, in 1446, he restored the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a> to the canons regular, formed a Canonical Institute. Speaking of the order founded by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> and reformed by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> says: "Blessed Gregory commanded .htm-->St. Augustine, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to establish it as a new plantation among the nation entrusted to his care and spread it to the utmost distant parts of the West." And William of Coventry, in his Chronicle, A.D. 620, tells us that "Paulinus with twelve <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> was sent by the Pope to help Augustine." In the North also the disciples of St. Columba were preaching the Gospel and establishing the canonical order among the nation they were converting to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The Roman and British <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> amalgamated, and were learn from English historians that most if not all the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and large churches were served by <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or canons regular till the tenth century, when they were replaced by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by royal authority, and sometimes by means even less lawful. <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Dr. Lingard</a> clearly states that: <blockquote> in many of these religious establishments the inmates had been Canons Regular from the beginning. In many they had originally been <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and had converted themselves into Canon, but all considered themselves bound by their rule to reside within the precincts of their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, to meet daily in the church for the performance of divine service, to take their meals in the same hall, and to sleep in the same dormitory. </blockquote>

<p>In fact, this same historian is of opinion that <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and his companions were <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> living in common. Writing of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in Anglo-Saxon times, <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Dr. Lingard</a> says: <blockquote> The chief resource of the Bishop lay in the Cathedral <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were carefully instructed in their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and trained in the exercise of their holy profession. They were distinguished by the name of Canons because the rule which they observed had been founded in accordance with the canons enacted in different councils. </blockquote>

<p>And he adds this explanatory note from the <em>Excerptiones</em> of Egbert: <blockquote> Canonen dicimus regulas quas sancti Patres constiturerunt in quibus scriptum est quomodo canonici, id est clerici regulares, vivere debeant. </blockquote>

<p>(By the term <em>canons</em> we designate those rules which the holy Fathers have laid down, in which it has been written how canons (<em>canonici</em>), i.e. <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, ought to live). We have also the fact that in the twelfth century many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> served by secular canons, like Plympton, Twynham, Taunton, Dunnow, Gisburn, were given to canons regular, who, it would seem, were the original owners. This view is confirmed by the authorities of various historians. In his <em>History of the Archbishops</em> (ed. Stubbs, Rolls Series, London, 1876), <a href="../cathen/04778a.htm">Diceto</a> tells us that at <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">Dunstan's</a> suggestion King Edgar drove the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> out of most of the churches of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and placed <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in their stead. In <em>Liber de Hyda</em> we find that canons had been introduced at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> by King Ethelred, and that Bishop Grimbald, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> reformer of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, had established a community of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to perform the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. Speaking of &AElig;lfric, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who had been elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, A.D. 995, remarks that when he came to hic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> he was received by a community of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, when he would have preferred <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.

<p>It would seem, then, that writers like Tanner, the modern editors of Dugdale's <em>Monasticon</em>, and others, who think that the canons regular were introduced into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> after the year 1100, or after the coming of William the Conqueror, may have been misled by the fact that it was only after the eleventh century that the canons regular were so styled generally; nevertheless these are the same <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, until then commonly called religious or <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. It is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, as elsewhere so in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in the twelfth century there was a great revival in the canonical order on account of various congregations newly found in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the Low countries, and it was some of these new canons that came with the Conqueror; but this does not prove that the canonical life was unknown before. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> alone, from the Conquest to the death of Henry II, no fewer than fifty-four houses were founded where the canons regular were established. Colchester in 1096 was the first, followed ten years later by <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. In 1100 Ralph Mortimer, by consent of Gerard, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, founded a canonical house at Wigmore, and in 1110 another house for Austin Canons was built at Haghmond. At Taunton a colony of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> became a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of canons regular. Secular canons were also replaced by canons regular at Twynham, Plympton, <a href="../cathen/15545a.htm">Waltham</a>, and other places. In the period mentioned there were, among others, the foundations of the Austin houses at Dunmow, Thremhall, Southhampton, Gisburn, newnham in Bedfordshire, Norton in Cheshire, Stone in Staffordshire, Anglesey and Barnwell in Cambridgeshire, Berden in Essex. This was, no doubt, a period of great prosperity for the canonical order in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. But soon <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days came. There was first the Black Plague, and like every other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution, the canons regular were fairly decimated, and we may say that they never quite recovered. To remedy the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a> thought it expedient to introduce a general reform of the whole canonical order in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In the capacity of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate, on 19 March, 1519, he issued the <em>Statuta</em>, which were to be observed by all the Austin Canons. These ordinance, as Abbot Gasquet observes, are valuable evidence as to the state of the great Augustinian Order at that time in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> provide for the union of all the Austin Canons; for the assembly of a general chapter every three years; for various matters concerning obedience, poverty, and the general discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. Special regulations are given for the daily recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> and singing of Masses. Directions are laid down for the reception and profession of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, for uniformity in the religious habit, and sending young students to <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford University</a>. But troubled days soon came over the land, and these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, good though they were, could not keep off the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> times. The canonical houses were suppressed, and the religious dispersed, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, little by little disappeared from the land altogether. Yet, in spite of the previous disasters, by Abbot Gasquet's computation ninety-one houses belonging to the canons regular were suppressed or surrendered at the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> between 1538 and 1540, with one thousand and eighty-three inmates &#151; namely, Austin Canons, fifty-nine houses and seven hundred and seventy-three canons; <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, nineteen houses and one hundred and fifty-one religious. This number of houses and religious does not include the lesser <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> with an aggregate of one house and five hundred <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and canon, nor the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the various orders estimated at one thousand five hundred and sixty.

<p>The best known canonical houses were: Walsingham, <a href="../cathen/15545a.htm">Waltham</a>, St. Mary's Overy, Bolton, St. Bartholomew's Smithfield, Nostall, Bridlington, <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a>, <a href="../cathen/03349b.htm">Carlisle</a>, Newbury, <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, Lanercost, Bodmin, Colchester, Dunstable, Merton, Kertmele, Llanthony, Plympton, <a href="../cathen/06303b.htm">St. Frideswide's</a> at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, Osney.

<p>At Walshingham there was a famous shrine of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, a model of the <a href="../cathen/13454b.htm">Holy House of Nazareth</a>, founded two hundred years before the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> removal to Loretto. <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, writing in the sixteenth century, gives a vivid description of the shrine and the canons, its custodians. At Bourne Abbey lived from 1300 to 1340 Robert de Brunne, a canon regular, who had been styled the "Father of the English language." In his monastic seclusion he welded together the diverse dialects, which then divided shire from shire, into the grammatical structure which the language has since retained. Bridlington Priory, where William de Newbridge and several other historians lived, was also sanctified by the life, virtues, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of its holy prior, John de Tweng, the last English saint to be <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> prior to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. He died in 1379. In 1386 a mandate was issued to collect evidence with a view to <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. The body was translated in 1405 <em>de mandato Domini papae</em>, and <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, the original of which was found in the Vatican Archives by J.A. Twemlow a few years ago, formally <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him. The holy prior was a very popular saint in the North of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. A rich shrine had been built over his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, from which the people begged <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> to withhold his hand; but all in vain. Lest the people should be reduced in the offering of their money, the shrine was pulled down and destroyed. Sempringham saw the beginning by St. Gilbert, and the wonderful growth of the only pre-Reformation institute of distinctly English origin. Here, too, Peter de Langtoft, the historian, lived and wrote his well-known works. Within the walls of Merton Abbey Thomas of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, when a youth, received his education and made his profession as a canon regular before he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Chic Priory, whence came William de Corbeil, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, was renowned for the learning of its religious <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>: "clerical litteratur&acirc; insignes." Thurgarton was the home of that spiritual writer, <a href="../cathen/07355a.htm">Walter Hilton</a>, who, about the year 1400, wrote the <em>Scala perfectionis</em>, usually attributed to some <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. <a href="../cathen/06303b.htm">St. Frideswide's</a>, founded for canons regular at Castle Tower by Robert d'Oiley, and translated to Osney in 1149, became, as <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> tells us, "a nursery for secular students, subject to the Chancellor's <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>." At Lilleshall Priory lived John Myrk, the author of <em>Instructions for Parish Priests</em>, a work written in irregular couplets, doubtless that they might be easily committed to memory. It has been edited by the Early English Text Society. The following verses, where Myrk gives excellent and explicit directions for behaviour in church, are a fair sample of the author's style: <blockquote> That when they do to Church fare, <br>Then bid them leave their many words, <br>Their idle speech and nice border (jests) <br>And put away all vanity <br>And say their <em>Pater Noster</em> and their <em>Ave</em>. <br>None in the church stand shall, <br>Nor lean to pillar not to wall, <br>But fair on knees they shall them set, <br>Kneeling down upon the flat, <br>And <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with heart meek <br>To give them grace and mercey eke. <br>Suffer them to make no bere (noise) <br>But aye to be in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. </blockquote>

<p>Some twenty-five years ago the canons regular of the Lateran Congregation returned to this Cornish town where before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> their brethren the Austin Canons had a beautiful <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Mary and St. Petrock. The new prior is now the residence of the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a>, or visitor, the novitiate-house for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and the center from which several Missions &#151; as Truro, <a href="../cathen/08256b.htm">St. Ives</a>, and Newquay &#151; are served by canons regular.

<p>Although when the storm of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> came and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> were either seized or surrendered the canons regular were not as faithful to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and their profession as might have been desired, yet there were not wanting many who preferred to lay down their lives rather than betray their Faith or give up <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Of this number were W. Wold, Prior of Bridlington, the Sub-Prior of Walsingham, with sixteen canons, and <a href="../cathen/15315c.htm">Ven. Laurence Vaux</a>. The canonical order is now represented in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> at Crowley, <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, Spalding, and Storrington. The Canons Regular of the Lateran Congregation are at Bodmin, Truro, <a href="../cathen/08256b.htm">St. Ives</a>, and Newquay, in Cornwall; at Spettisbury and Swanage, in Dorsetshire; at Stroud Green and Eltahm, in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Besides the occupations of the regular life at home and the public recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in choir, they are chiefly employed in serving missions, preaching retreats, supplying for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who ask their service, and hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, either as ordinary or extraordinary confessors to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> or other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities.

<p>The canonical order must have been introduced into the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> soon after the discovery of that country by <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>. In fact, tradition tells us that some canons regular from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> were his companions in one or other of his voyages. Certain it is that at the general chapter of the Lateran Congregation held at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> in 1558, at the request of many Spanish canons, Don Francis de Agala, a professed canon regular from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, who for some ten years had already laboured in the newly-discovered country, was created <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in America, with powers to gather into communities all the members of the canonical institute who were then dispersed in those parts, and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to report to the authorities of the order. At present there are canons regular of the Lateran Congregation in the <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> the Canons of the Immaculate Conception serve different missions. The Premonstratensian Canons also are in different places in South America.
<h2>Reforms and congregations</h2>

<p>As we have already observed, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries a great reform and revival took place in the canonical order. A great number of congregations of canons regular sprang into existence, each with its own distinctive constitutions, grounded on the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> which Blessed Peter do Honestis, about the year 1100, gave to his canons at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, where also he instituted the first sodality, called "The Children of Mary." In order to preserve uniformity and regularity among these numerous congregations <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Pope Benedict XII</a>, in the year 1339, issued his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Ad decorem</em>, which may be rather called a book of constitutions to be observed by all canons regular then existing. By this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> the order, then extending through <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, was divided into twenty-two provinces or kingdoms, among them being <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, forming each a province. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and visitors were to be convened at a provincial chapter to be held in each province every four years. Visitors were to be elected. Whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to make a <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> of every house in their respective provinces. Minute regulations are laid down for the daily recitation or singing of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in choir, clothings, professions, studies at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, expenses and other details in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> life, and the general discipline of the canons in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. The Roman Martyrology mentions the existence of more than thirty-three different congregations of canons regular. The historian of the order number no fewer than fifty-four. It is evident that it would be quite impossible to give here even a short account of each in particular, therefore we shall content ourselves with making special mention of a few.

<p>By common consent the Lateran Congregation, officially styled <em>Congregatio SS. Salvatoris Lateranensis</em>, stands first in antiquity and importance. As the title implies, this congregation takes its origin from the Roman Basilica of St. John Lateran, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> own <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. History, confirmed by the authority of Pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, informs us that Pope Silvester established in the basilica built by the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> living in common after the manner of the Primitive Church. In the year 492, Gelasius, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, as we have already mentioned, introduced in the patriarchal basilica the regular discipline which he had learnt at <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a>, <a href="../cathen/05598b.htm">Eugenius II</a>, <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Sergius III</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>, all endeavoured to maintain the observance of the regular life established among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the basilica. As relaxation had crept in, the last name <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, at the request of <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>, called some canons from St. Frigidian at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, a house of strict observance. The reform spread, till at length the houses that had embrace it were formed into one large congregation. In the eighteenth century the Lateran Congregation numbered forty-five <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and seventy-nine other houses in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, besides many affiliated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of canonesses, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and colleges of canons regular outside of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The canons regular served the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a> from the time they were put in possession till 1391, when secular canons were introduced by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. Several attempts were made to restore the basilica to its original owners, and finally <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugenius IV</a>, in 1445, gave it over to them, an act which was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a>. But the arrangement did not last long, and eventually the canons regular were definitively displaced, and the basilica made over to secular canons. All that remains now to the canons regular is the nae they derive from the basilica and a few other privileges, such as precedence over all the other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and the faculty of saying all the Offices which are said by the Lateran Canons in all their Church.

<p>There are at present houses belonging to the Lateran Congregation in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and America. The congregation is divided into six provinces, each presided over by a visitor or provincial. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> general and <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> general reside in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at S. Pietro in Vincoli, where is also the directorate of the confraternity called "The Children of Mary." There are <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> houses, where young men are prepared for the order, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The proper habit of the Lateran Congregation is a white woolen cassock with a linen <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a>, which is worn as an essential part of the daily dress. Their work is essentially <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a>, the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in church, the administration of the Sacraments, the preaching of the Word. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> they have charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Bologna, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, <a href="../cathen/05785a.htm">Fano</a>, <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, and elsewhere.

<p>It is the opinion of <a href="../cathen/07214a.htm">H&eacute;lyot</a> and others that no Canons of the Holy Sepulchre existed before 1114, when some canons regular, who had adopted the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, were brought from the West and introduced into the Holy City by <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey of Bouillon</a>. On the other hand, Francisco Su&aacute;rez, Mauburn, Ferreri, Vanderspeeten, and other, upholding the tradition of the canonical order, maintain that St. James the Less, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, established <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> living in common the in the Holy City, where also, after the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, flourished the Congregation of the Holy Sepulchre. Driven away by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>, the canons sought refuge in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, where they had <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and the Low Countries. In these several countries, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, they continued to exist until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> they seem to have been suppressed by <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, who, in 1489, transferred all their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the Knights of Malta. As regards men, the congregation seems now extinct, but it is still represented by Sepulchrine Canonesses, who have converts in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. According to Dugdale's <em>Monasticon</em>, the canons had two houses in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, one at Thetford and the other at Warwick. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 10 January, 1143, to be found in the <em>Bullarium Lateranense</em>, <a href="../cathen/03478a.htm">Pope Celestine II</a> confirms the church and the Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre in all the possessions they had received from <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey of Bouillon</a>, King Baldwin, and other benefactors. Mention is also made in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of several churches in the Holy Land and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> belonging to the canons. Cardinal de Vitry, a canon regular of Oignies, and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, who had lived in Palestine some years, relates that the canons served, amongst other churches, that of the Holy Sepulchre and those on Mount Sion and on Mount Olivet. The patriarch was also <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the Holy Sepulchre, and was elected by the canons regular.

<p>In the year 1109 the famous scholar and teacher, William de Champeaux, formerly <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and afterwards a canon regular, opened, at the request of his disciples, in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Victor near the city, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which, owing to the great reputation of the master for learning, soon drew crowds of students from many parts. Founded by a scholar, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Victor for many centuries was a centre of learning and virtue, or, as a French writer (Pasquier) says, "Les lettres y furent toujours log&eacute;es a bonnes enseignes" (there, letters were always entertained at good inns). Here were formed men like Hugh, Richard, and <a href="../cathen/01134b.htm">Adam of St. Victor</a>, all famous for their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works and their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. The last named, Adam, had been called by <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> "the greatest poet of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>." It was Adam who, among his beautiful <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> composed three admirable proses in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>, beginning "Gaude Sion et latare", "Aquas plenas amaritudine", "Pia Mater plangat Ecclesia". The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> composer writes very feelingly of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, whom he had heard and seen at St. Victor only sixteen months before his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, while at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to thank the king for his protection, wished also to visit the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Victor, where at the time lived the saintly Richard. This visit took place on the octave of the Feast of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, and the chronicler relates how the future <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was joyously received by the community and was introduced into the chapter room, where he made an address to the brethren from the text, "In pace factus est locus" (Psalm 75). This visit and conference of their holy brother (for it must be remembered that <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> had made his profession as a canon regular) made a great impression, we are told, on all who were present, and they remembered it when they shortly after heard of his cruel death.

<p>So great was the reputation of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> built by William de champeaus that houses were soon established everywhere after the model of St. Victor's, which was regarded as their mother-house. At the death of Gilduin, the immediate successor of William, who had been made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, the Congregation already counted forty-four houses. From this congregation, in 1149, sprang another, that of Sainte Genevieve, which in its turn became very numerous and, reformed as the Gallican Congregation, in the sixteenth century, by a holy man called Charles Faure, had, at the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, no fewer than one hundred <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Both these congregations became extinct, as far as men are concerned, but the ancient congregation of St. Victor is still represented by a very old community of canonesses at Ronsbrugge, near Ypres, in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Some years ago the congregation was revived, with some modifications, by the Very Rev. Dom Goea, then <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of St. Claude in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, under the denomination of <a href="../cathen/03297a.htm">Canons Regular of the Immaculate Conception</a>. Before their expulsion from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> they served the ancient Abbey of St. Anthony in Dauphin&eacute;. They have now <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Their habit is a white woollen gown and linen <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> with a black cloak.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Congregation was founded at <a href="../cathen/12392a.htm">Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</a>, near Laon, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, by St. Norbert, in the year 1120, and approved by Pope Honorius II, in 1126. According to the spirit of its founder, this congregation unites the active with the contemplative life, the institute embracing in its scope the sanctification of its members and the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. It grew large even during the lifetime of its founder, and now has charge of many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> wear a white habit with white <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>. They are governed by an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> general, vicars, and visitors.

<p>The origin of the <a href="../cathen/07403a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Cross</a> appears to be uncertain, although all admit its great antiquity. It has been divided into four chief branches: the Italian, the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a>, and the Spanish. Of this last very little is known. The branch once flourishing in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, after several attempts at reformation, was finally suppressed by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> in 1656. In <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> there are still some houses of Croisier Canons, as they are called, who, however, seem to be different from the well known <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Canons of the Holy Cross, who trace their origin to the time of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> and recognize for their Father Blessed Theodore de Celles, who founded their first house at Huy, near <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. These <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Croisier Canons have a great affinity with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. They follow the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, and their contitutions are mainly those compiled for the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> by Raymond of Pennafort. Besides the usual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of canons in the church, they are engaged in preaching, administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and teaching. Formerly they had houses in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. Till some years ago they served missions in North America. At present they have five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, of which St. Agatha is considered the mother-house. To these Croisier Canons belongs the privilege, granted to them by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, and confirmed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, of blessing beads with an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of 500 days. Their habit was formerly black, but is now a white soutane with a black <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> and a cross, white and black on the breast. In choir they wear in summer the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> with a black almuce.

<p>To <a href="../cathen/06557b.htm">St. Gilbert of Sempringham</a> is due the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of founding the only <a href="../cathen/06556b.htm">religious order</a> of distinctly English origin. Having completed his studies in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he returned to the <a href="../cathen/09266a.htm">Diocese of Lincoln</a>, where he began to labour with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, becoming a canon regular in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bridlington. But finding that the discipline of the order was not strictly observed, he conceived, in 1148, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of introducing a reform in those regions. After much <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, thought, and taking advice from holy men, he came to the conclusion that it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to establish a new congregation, composed of both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who should <a href="../cathen/10452a.htm">live under the same roof</a>, though of course separated. This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> he put into execution, giving the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and that of canons regular to the men, with special and carefully elaborated constitutions for both. The Gilbertine Congregation spread especially in the North of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and as already stated, at the time of the general dissolution it had twenty houses and one hundred and fifty-one religious. At the temporary University of Stamford, Sempringham Hall, founded by Robert Lutrell in 1292, was especially for the students of the Gilbertine Congregation.

<p>The canons regular, usually called <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, whom visitors find serving at the Hospice on the Great St. Bernard, belong to the Congregation of St. Augustine, St. Bernard, and St. Nicholas, as it is officially called. They were established on this famous pass of the Alps by <a href="../cathen/02503b.htm">Bernard of Menthon</a>, a canon regular of <a href="../cathen/01591c.htm">Aosta</a>, about the year 969, according to some, or later, according to others. The religious institute in such a place was only meant by the founder for the convenience of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and travellers who cross the Alps at a point always full of dangers. The hospice, the canons, their work are too well known to need more than a short mention here. Besides <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and servants, thee are always at the hospice about fifteen canons, who come from Martigny, their mother-house, where also resides the superior general of the congregation. Some canons have charge of the hospice on the Simpion Pass, and a certain number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the Canton Valais are served by canons of the same congregation.

<p>The origin of the Windesheim Congregation is due to <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Gerard Groot</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> preacher and reformer of the fourteenth century, at Deventer in the Low Countries. Touched by his preaching and example, many poor <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> students gathered around him and, under his direction, "putting together whatever they earned week by week, began to live in common." Such was the beginning of the institute known as that of the <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">"Brothers and Sisters of the Common Life"</a>. This institution spread rapidly, and in short time nearly every town in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and the adjacent countries contained one or more houses of "The New Devotion" as it was then called. But difficulties were not wanting. The members of "The New Devotion" were not bound together by any <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and the institute had received no formal approval from the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Groot</a> foresaw that the only safeguard for the continuance of the new institute was to affiliate it in some way to some great <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order already approved by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to the authority of which the devout brethren and sisters might look for guidance and protection. Having heard of the famous <a href="../cathen/13280c.htm">Blessed John Ruysbrock</a>, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of a house of canons regular at Groendael near <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, he went to visit and consult him. Deeply edified by what he saw and heard there, <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Gerard Groot</a> resolved to place this new institute under the spiritual guidance of the canons regular. The execution of tis resolve was left by <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Gerard Groot</a>, at his death, to his beloved disciple, Florentius Radwyn. A beginning was soon made, and the foundation of the first house laid at Windersheim, near Zwolle. This became the mother-house of the famous congregation, which, only sixty years after the death of <a href="../cathen/07036a.htm">Groot</a>, possessed in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> alone more than eighty well-organized monasteries, some of which, according to the chronicler John Buschius, who had visited them all, contained as many as a hundred, or even two hundred, inmates. The congregation continued in its primitive fervour until the devastations of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> drove it from its native soil, and it was at last utterly destroyed during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. To this double institute the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> owes many <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned men &#151; as Raymond Jordan, called Idiota, <a href="../cathen/13280c.htm">John Ruysbrock</a>, Mauburn, Garetius, Latomus, and <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>. Some, like St. John Ostervick, <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, shed their blood rather than deny their Faith. Chief among these learned and holy men stands <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>, when still a youth joined the institute, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the saintly Floretius and the first founders of the congregation.

<p>Although the canonical order possessed so many houses in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> before the dissolution by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>; yet, on account of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, little by little it appears to have languished, and by 1620 to have been nearly extinct; it somewhat revived, however, for canons regular were once more to be found in the country not long after this. It is not improbable that at the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, like many members of other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, some of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> canons may have retired to foreign <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and maintained a quasi-independent existence, and have been joined by others of their compatriots who were desirous of entering the canonical institute. In 1645 Dom Thaddeus O'Conel was butchered at Sligo by the Scotch <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> together with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, Malachy O'Quechly. At the commencement of 1646 the canons were sufficiently numerous to be formed by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> into a separate congregation, that of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, and this congregation, as the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> declared, inherited all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, privileges, and possessions of the old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> canons. In the year 1698 the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Congregation, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a>, was affiliated and aggregated to the Lateran Congregation. From the moment the union was made the two congregations formed but one, and the members of each enjoyed all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of the other. The constitutions of the Lateran Congregation were adopted with some little modification by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>. In 1703 Dom Milerius Burke, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Thomas, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, was appointed by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> general, Clappini, with the approval of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in the three kingdoms. In 1735 the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> canons were claiming before the Congregation of Propoganda their right to several churches, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and houses. The cause was settled in their favour, but there were many difficulties, and they could get possession of only a few. In the "Spicilegium Ossoriense" (III, 148) we find that Henry O'Kelly, a canon regular, obtained from <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Pope Benedict XIII</a> letters in virtue of which he not only called himself <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Thomas, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, but also claimed the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over a great part of the city, without any dependence upon the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. The last canon of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Congregation died towards the beginning of the nineteenth century. But the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Congregation having been united, as we have stated, with the Lateran, all its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges still survive in the last-named.

<p>The Austrian-Congregation, formed in 1907, is composed of the various ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and collegiate churches of canons regular in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. These are St. Florian, Klosterneuburg, Reichersburg, Voran, Neustift. The president of this new congregation is the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Florian.

<p>Other more or less distinct congregations now no longer in existence have been those of Sts. Rufus, founded in 1039, and once flourishing in Dauphine; of Aroasia (<a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Diocese of Arras</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>), founded in 1097; Marbach (1100); of the Holy Redeemer of Bologna, also called the Renana (1136), now united to the Lateran Congregation; of the Holy Spirit in Sassia (1198); of St. George in Alga, at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1404); of Our Saviour in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, reformed in 1628 by <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a>.
<h2>Canonesses regular</h2>

<p>To most <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregation of men <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> are related, following the same rules and constitutions. There are canonesses regular, as well as canons regular. The Apostolic origin is common to both. As Francisco Su&aacute;rez says, with regard to origin and antiquity the same is to be said of orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> both in general and in particular as of orders of men. The one generally began with the other. <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> in his <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">rules</a> addresses both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> founded his first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in Africa at <a href="../cathen/14553b.htm">Tagaste</a>. Most, if not all, of the congregations which go to form the canonical order had, or still have, a correlative congregation for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> instituted canons regular, and St. Bridget was the first of numberless canonesses. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the Gilbertine Congregation were nearly always double, for men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. As with the canons, so also among the canonesses, discipline and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of community life now flourished now languished, so that in the tenth and eleventh centuries many of them became <em>canonicae saeclulares</em> and though living in the same house, no longer cherished the spirit of religious poverty or kept a common table.

<p>On the other hand many communities of canonesses willingly took the name and the rule of life laid down for the congregations of regular canons. There still exist in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, America, <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> belonging to the Lateran or to some other congregation of canons regular. The contemplative life is represented by such <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> as Newton Abbey in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Sta. Pudenziana at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Sta. Maria di Passione at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, Hernani in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/15069b.htm">St. Trudo</a> at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>. The Hospitalarians were till lately well represented in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of canonesses at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, Laon, <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, and elsewhere.

<p>Occupied in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children, there are besides some of the ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of canonesses of various congregations, the canonesses of the Congregation of Notre Dame, instituted in 1597 at Mattaincourt, in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, by <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a>. This congregation, whose object is the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of poor girls, spread rapidly in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. There are now <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Notre Dame in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Africa. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> alone, until the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of 1907, they had some thirty flourishing communities and as many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for externs and boarders. Driven away from France, some have taken refuge in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, like those of the famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Les Oiseaux, Paris, who are now at Westgate, and those of <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a> who have settled at Hull. With some modifications the work was soon introduced into the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> in a remarkable way. The canonesses of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> had for some time earnestly desired to carry on their institute in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Circumstances, however, prevented their going, but at their request Margaret Borugeoys, the president, of the confraternity attached to their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, gladly crossed the ocean. In 1657 she opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, in which, in accordance with the rules laid down by Peter Fourier, the poor were taught gratuitously. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was a great success. Margaret returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to ask for helpers, and found them among her sister, the Children of Mary of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> with four fellow-workers, and soon followed by others she opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boarders as well as a day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In 1676 these <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were formed into the "Congregation of Notre Dame." Margaret died in 1700 and has since been declared venerable. The work she had transferred to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> is still flourishing. At her death there were ten houses in the Dominion; there are now more than a hundred spread over the whole of North America under a superior general, who resides at the mother-house, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>.

<p>In 1809 <a href="../cathen/15679a.htm">Bishop Wittmann</a> founded, in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, "The Poor Sisters of the Schools of Notre Dame", and institute similar to that founded by St. Peter Forier. This association is now widespread in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and in America, and has done excellent work in the field of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>.

<p>There are English canonesses at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, and at Neuilly, near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Holy Sepulchre at New Hall, with a flourishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, originally at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>; also a filiation of that at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, at Hayward's heath, with a large <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; at Newton Abbey a numerous community, with a colony at Hoddesdon, devoted to the contemplative life and the Perpetual Adoration. This last <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> is, as it were, a link with the pre-Reformation canonesses, through Sister Elizabeth Woodford, who was professed at Barnharm, Priory, Bucks, 8 December, 1519. When the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was suppressed, in 1539, she was received for some time into the household of <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Saint Thomas More</a>. Later on she went to the Low Countries and was received into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of canonesses regular at <a href="../cathen/15225d.htm">St. Ursula's</a>, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, of the Windersheim Congregation. So many English ladies, daughters and sisters of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, like Ann Clitheroe, Margaret Clement, Eleanor and Margaret Garnet, followed her that, in 1609, they formed an English community, St. Monica's, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, this community of English canonesses returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, first to Spettisbury, afterwards to their present home at Newton Abbey. The chronicles of this ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> are being published, and two very interesting volumes have already appeared.
