<h1>Canossa</h1>  

<p>A former castle of Matilda, Countess of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, in the foothills of the Apennines, about eighteen miles from <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, where took place the dramatic penance of King Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in presence of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a>. The king, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> 22 February, 1076, would have been utterly abandoned by the inimical German princess unless within a year he made peace with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Early in January, 1077, the latter was on his way to the diet called to meet at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, 2 February, when he heard that Henry had crossed Mont Cenis. Fearing for his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, he took refuge in the impregnable and almost inaccessible burg of Canossa, the hereditary stronghold of his friend and protectress, Matilda. The king, however, was really intent on performing the penance <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to lift the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, by which diplomatic step the plans of his enemies in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> would be nullified. For three days (25-27 January) he stood constantly before the castle gate, in the dress of a penitent, beseeching with many tears the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> forgiveness. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> finally yielded, moved by the royal compunction and by the importunities of his royal entourage, among them Matilda. He received Henry back into the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and promised to promote his reconciliation with the German princes. But the king soon violated his solemn <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to comply with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> conditions, and renewed the conflict. The story, as narrated above, is told by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> himself (Reg. Ep., IV, 12), in a letter to the princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> explanatory of the event of Canossa. The contemporary chronicler, <a href="../cathen/08758a.htm">Lambert of Hersfeld</a>, asserts that at the Mass of reconciliation the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, when about to give communion to Henry, took himself on half of the Sacred Host and challenged the king to take the other as an ordeal. Modern historians deny the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this assertion.

<p>The penance of Henry was, in reality, only a personal humiliation, and not a degradation of the royal office; nor was it in that form imposed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, nor did the king spend three days and nights in his bare shirt without food and without shelter (Hergenr&ouml;ther, "Kirchengeschichte", ed. Kirsch, II, 361). The ruins of Canossa are now within the Commune of Ciano d'Enza, some shapeless fragments of broken walls that rise on rocky buttresses above a sea of hardened brown mud, "twisted and tossed and contorted into the most hideous of crevasses" (Hare). The castle-well and "gate of penance" alone remain.
