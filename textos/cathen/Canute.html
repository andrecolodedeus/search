<h1>Canute</h1>  

<p>(Or CNUT: THE GREAT, THE MIGHTY)

<p>King of the English, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegians</a>, b. about 994; d. at Shaftesbury, 12 November 1035. He was the son of Sweyn, King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and Sigrid, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Eric of Sweden. Though <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> while a child, there is no evidence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in his life until after he ascended the English throne. He accompanied his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> on the invasion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and after the repulse at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and Sweyn's sudden death near Bury (3 February, 1014) was declared King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> fleet. The witan, however, recalled &AElig;thelred, their "born lord", who had fled at Sweyn's approach, and Canute, unable to withstand the restored monarch, set sail for the North. At Sandwich, after cutting off the noses, ears, and hands of the hostages taken by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, he put them ashore &mdash; a dire omen of a more terrible return. Returned to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, Canute proclaimed himself king and set about gathering a powerful fleet. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, instead of being prepared for his return, was torn by internal dissensions, and when Canute appeared off the coast with a fleet, said to have numbered two hundred sail, each boat containing eighty men, Eadrie deserted Eadmund Ironside and joined the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> standard. Upon the death of &AElig;thelred, Eadmund was made king by the people of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and, with all Wessex in submission, Canute laid siege to the city. This was the beginning of a series of bloody conflicts, interrupted only by pillage of the country-side, culminating at Assandun, where, after battle which was waged all day and into the night, the English were routed, and "all the nobility of the English race was there destroyed" (Anglo-Saxon Chron., ed. Giles, London, 1847, p. 409). Eadmund was still formidable. Canute followed him into Gloucestershire and made terms of peace on the Isle of Olney. Mercia and Northumbria were Canute's portion, and a tax known as the "danegeld" was levied on both armies to defray the expenses of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> fleet. Eadmund died a month later after a heroic reign of seven months; Eadric was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at the king's order; <a href="../cathen/05324a.htm">Eadwig</a>, Eadmund's brother was similarly removed; and in July, 1017, Canute married &AElig;lfgifu, or Emma, Eadmund's <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, a strange union which some writers attribute to political motives. Canute already had two sons, Harold and Sweyn, by another wife, but the right of succession was to be with the offspring of the new union.

<p>Thus at the age of twenty-three, by right of might, Canute stood master of the realm; and if he was received unanimously by the people, it was because none durst oppose him. From this forward, however, his one desire seemed to be to wipe out the memory of the bloodshed and horror in which his kingship had been secured. The <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> host, a fruitful source of animosity, was dismissed after a danegeld of &#163;72,000 had been raised, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> alone contributing &#163;15,000. Canute retained the crews of forty ships as a body-guard, known as the <em>huscarls</em> or <em>thingmanna</em>. "Eadgar's Law", the old constitution of the realm, was revived and Dane and Englishman stood on a level footing. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had suffered heavily at Canute's hands, but he sought her friendship and built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> at Assandun to commemorate the victory; rebuilt the church of St. Eadmund at <a href="../cathen/03085a.htm">Bury</a> and established the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> there; and was a benefactor in many other places, contributing even to the erection of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>. On his visits to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> he took many missionaries with him, among whom were Ranier, Bernhard, and Gerbrand, Bishops of Fionia, Sconen, and Zealand. In 1026 Canute made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, his path being marked by his charities. He records in a letter his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at visiting the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Apostles; his meeting with Pope John and Emperor Conrad; his plea for security for English and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> travellers to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> promise to lighten the tax for the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>; and he adds his own <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to rule justly and regrets the misdeeds of his youth.

<p>Canute's greatest gift to his people was peace, says Green. Eighteen years unbroken by domestic strife laid the foundations of a national tranquillity. The kingdom was divided into four earldoms, and little by little <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> names disappear and are replaced by English (Freeman, Norman Conquest, I, 289). The people are to "love and worship one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> King Cnut with right truthfulness". The ferocity which mutilated the hostages was not burnt out, for the king struck down one of his huscarls with his own hand. But he pronounced heavy sentence upon his deed and, on another occasion, is said to have rebuked his flatterers by placing his crown upon the crucifix of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>. From the time his sceptre is secure, a sincere <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for his people's good shines out in his life. The yoke is lightened and his benefactions are widespread. He is a patron of poets and a lover of minstrelsy, and upon hearing the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> chant on <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Candlemas</a>, he breaks out into the famous song:&mdash;

<blockquote><p>Merie sungen &#240;e muneches binnen Ely, <br>&#208;a Cnut Ching reu &#240;er by; <br>Rowe&#240;, Cnihtes, noer &#240;e land, <br>And here we &#254;es muneches s&aelig;ng.

<p>(Merrily sang the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> when Cnut King rowed by. Row, boatmen, near the land, and hear we these <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> sing.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Intriguing, ambitious, and violent, Canute yet atoned for his early cruelty by a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> that was not unworthy. He came as an invader and ruthless destroyer, and by a change of temperament as remarkable as it was far-reaching in its effects, remained to rule, in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and peace, a people whose part he wholly espoused. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the old minster at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>.
