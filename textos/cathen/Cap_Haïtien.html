<h1>Cap Ha&iuml;tien</h1>  

<p>(CAPITIS HAITIANI)

<p>Erected by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 3 October, 1861, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province of Port au Prince, territorially corresponds to the Department of the North of the French-speaking <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> Republic of Haiti. In 1906 the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the See of Cap Ha&iuml;tien covered some 650,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or rather more than one-fourth of the whole population of the Haitian Republic, which forms the western political division (about one-third the area) of the Island of Santo Domingo, the largest but one of the Greater Antilles.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>On his second voyage to <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, or, as he named it, Hispaniola, <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> brought with him some religious of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>. This was in November, 1493, and since then the Haitian part of the island, at least, has never lacked <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. A plan of the city of Cap Ha&iuml;tien still extant, and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the year 1600, differs hardly at all in extent from the plan of the present city. In the collection of annals of the "missions catholiques" there are, also, letters of the same period, written from Petite Anse by a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the North were generally served by religious of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, but there were also at Cap Ha&iuml;tien some <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> whose names have been preserved, and one section of that city is still called "Morne des Capucins". In addition to the work of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> administered a very large <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at the gate of the city and another (military) <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> inside. There was also a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, very fine, and of very considerable size, to judge by its site, which has remained unoccupied, being now held in reserve by the Government for the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny, whenever that congregation shall be able to found an establishment there.

<p>From the time when Haiti secured its national independence (1804) to the Concordat (1860) the country was without a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. After a period of unsuccessful attempts at <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reorganization under vicars and prefects Apostolic, negotiations between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the administration of President Geffrard resulted (28 March, 1860) in the conclusion of the Concordat, which expired in 1885. Monsignor Monetti, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lervia, was sent to Haiti in 1861 to settle various points left open in the text of the Concordat, and among these was the establishment of a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at Cap Ha&iuml;tien, as well as the amount of the stipends to be paid to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and vicars-general. Provision was made for another diocese at Port de la Paix, but it was never formally established, and its territory is administered from Cap Ha&iuml;tien.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cap Ha&iuml;tien, Monseigneur Constant Mathurin Hillion, took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> 24 May, 1874. There was no <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Offices</a> were performed in a miserable <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> which was much too small. To supply this pressing need the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> set about rebuilding a ruined church which dated from the time of Louis XV. He was able to collect a sum of about 200,000 francs ($40,000), and in the space of three months an American company completed the construction of the actual <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> with its <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> and choir being still (1906) incomplete. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> also lost no time in establishing two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, one for boys and the other for girls, under the <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Institute of Christian Instruction</a> (Fr&egrave;res La Mennais) and the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny. The sisters had arrived 9 May, 1872; the Fr&egrave;res La Mennais came 9 November, 1877. At this epoch, through the initiative of P&egrave;re Bertin, <em>cur&eacute;</em> and honorary canon, the equipment of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was rendered complete by the erection of a presbytery. Upon the death of Monseigneur Guillons, Monseigneur Hillion succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12284a.htm">Port-au-Prince</a>, and Monseigneur Kersuzan, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> and coadjutor to the late <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cap Ha&iuml;tien, 10 November, 1886. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cap Ha&iuml;tien had until then resided in a house too small for the gatherings of all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in their annual retreat. He found means to build a very fine episcopal residence, with a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and adequate outbuildings, an edifice undeniable the most considerable in the city after the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. This residence was destroyed by fire, but the construction of a more spacious and equally imposing edifice is now (1906) in progress. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> had been carried on at Pont-Chateau, in Brittany, by the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a> founded by B. Ren&eacute; de Montfort. When the French Government outlawed the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, Monseigneur Kersuzan succeeded in installing his present <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (Saint-Jacques) at Lanpaul, in the <a href="../cathen/12611a.htm">Diocese of Quimper</a>, Brittany. It is under the care of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>: a director, two administrators, and six professors, with 50 students. The same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> also founded at Cap Ha&iuml;tien the College of <em>Notre-Dame de secours perp&eacute;tuel</em>, which affords Haitian youths the advantages of secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> without the expense and risks of a sojourn in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. This college is administered by a director, two ecclesiastic, and two lay, teachers. Lastly, the hospice owes to Monseigneur Kersuzan the introduction of the sisters, whose ministrations insure disinterested care for the sick with due consideration of their spiritual welfare.
<h2>Religious and educational status</h2>

<p>Since the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> the twenty-one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> have little by little been provided with <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, and some with assistants. There are altogether sixty-three churches, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> in the diocese. The number of practical <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> has more than trebled and marriages have multiplied everywhere. There still remains, however, an unconverted majority in the immense <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, which often contain a population of 30,000, while the smallest always contain several thousands.

<p>In addition to the college already mentioned there is a boys' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, conducted by ten of the Fr&egrave;res La Mennais, with 200 pupils; and three other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, each employing three religious of the same order, with from 150 to 200 pupils in each. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny carry on six <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, one with 250 pupils under ten sisters, and five, each with 150 pupils under three sisters. The <a href="../cathen/15668a.htm">Daughters of Wisdom</a> supply, besides ten religious for the hospice, 22 religious, teaching an aggregate of 750 girls in six <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in as many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> residing in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is extremely small, and is made up almost entirely of strangers from the neighbouring islands. There are three <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Masonic</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> at Cap Ha&iuml;tien, and probably one in each of the other towns or considerable villages of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. When there was virtually no <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, it was a fashion in Haiti to join the lodges; but these are now little frequented, except two or three times a year, on festival occasions, when there are receptions or banquets.
