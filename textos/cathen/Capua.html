<h1>Capua</h1>  

<p>(C<font size=-2>APUANA</font>).

<p>The city of Capua is situated in the province of <a href="../cathen/03399a.htm">Caserta</a>, Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Of Etruscan foundation, it was formerly known as <em>Volturnum</em> and was capital of <em>Campania Felix</em>. About 424 B.C. it was captured by the Samnites and in 343 B.C. implored Roman help against its conquerors. During the Second Punic War, after Hannibal's victory at Cannae (216 B.C.), he and his army were <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> received by Capua, where the Carthaginians became demoralized by luxurious living. The city was recaptured by the Romans (211 B.C.), its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, and the territory declared common land (<em>ager publicus</em>). Julius Caesar made Capua a Roman colony under the name <em>Julia Felix</em>. In A.D. 456 the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> under Genseric sacked the city. During the Gothic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> Capua suffered greatly, and similarly a little later from the Lombards. About 840 it was burned to the ground by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, after which it was rebuilt, but at some distance from the former site, where, however, another city was built and called Santa Maria in Capua Vetere. In 1058, the Norman, Richard, Prince of <a href="../cathen/02151a.htm">Aversa</a>, conquered it; thenceforth its history is linked with that of the Two Sicilies.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, it is said, was first preached at Capua by St. Priscus, a disciple of St. Peter. In the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> mention is made of many Capuan <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and it is probable that, owing to its position and importance, Capua received the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> at a very early period. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of whom there is positive record is Protasius, present at the Roman Council under <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Pope Melchiades</a> (313); he was succeeded by Protus Vincentius, a Roman <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of Pope Sylvester I at <a href="../cathen/11043a.htm">Nicaea</a>, who took a prominent part in the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> controversies, and was present at the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (343). At the <em>conciliabulum</em> of Arles (353) he was led astray by <a href="../cathen/16027c.htm">Constantius</a> and consented to the deposition of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> for which he made amends <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">at</a> <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>. Bishop Memorius, who held a council to deal with the Schism of Antioch and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Bonosus, is often mentioned in the letters of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and St. Paulinus, and was the father of that ardent <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a>, <a href="../cathen/08557b.htm">Julian of Eclanum</a>. In 443, Priscus, an exile from North Africa and a man of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; possibly it is his name that popular tradition carried back to the head of the list of Capuan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Another incumbent of this see was Germanus, whom Pope Hormisdas sent twice to Constantinople to restore unity with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. In 541, Bishop Benedictus died and was ever afterwards held in repute of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. His successor, Victor, was a learned <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>. In 968 <a href="../cathen/08427a.htm">John XIII</a> took refuge in Capua, and in gratitude raised the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> rank. In 1087, under <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Victor III</a>, and in 1118, under Gelasius II, councils were held in Capua; at the latter Henry V and the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/06795b.htm">Gregory VIII</a> (Burdinus), were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Among other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, nearly all famous for their learning, are: M. Marino (1252), a disciple of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>; Filippo de Berilli (1506), who suffered for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice'</a> sake; Fra Nicol&ograve; Schomberg (1520), a distinguished <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>; Cesare Costa (1573), active as a reformer of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and a learned canonist; Cardinal Robert <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (1602); and <a href="../cathen/16017a.htm">Cardinal Capecelatro</a>, Librarian of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a> and author of many learned works. The suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Capua are: Caiazzo, <a href="../cathen/03195a.htm">Calvi and Teano</a>, <a href="../cathen/03399a.htm">Caserta</a>, <a href="../cathen/08185b.htm">Isernia and Venafro</a>, Sessa Aurunca. The archdiocese contains a population of 96,800, with 57 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 90 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 255 secular and 18 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 16 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.
