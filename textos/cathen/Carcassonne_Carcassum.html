<h1>Carcassonne (Carcassum)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising the entire department of Aude, and suffragan to <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. On the occasion of the Concordat of 1802 the former Diocese of Carcassonne, nearly all the old Archdiocese of Narbonne, almost the entire Diocese of Saint-Papoul, a part of the ancient Dioceses of Alet and Mirepoix, and the former <a href="../cathen/11700b.htm">Diocese of Perpignan</a> were united to make the one Diocese of Carcassone; in 1822 the <a href="../cathen/11700b.htm">Diocese of Perpignan</a> was re-established. (1) <em>The Diocese of Carcassone</em> was founded after 533. The <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> sought to compensate themselves for the loss of Lod&#232;ve and Uz&#232;s by having Carcassonne erected into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. The first of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> known to history was Sergius (589). From 1848 to 1855 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was occupied by <a href="../cathen/02674b.htm">Bishop de Bonnechose</a>, later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, and from 1855 to 1873, by the <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical</a> writer, Bishop de la Bouillerie. (2) <em>The Archdiocese of Narbonne.</em> Local tradition identifies Paulus, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Narbonne, with Sergius Paulus mentioned in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> (xiii, 7), but <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> assigns the episcopate of St. Paulus to the middle of the third century. Among other incumbents of the See of Narbonne were St. Rusticus (427-61); St. Theodardus (885-93); Guifredus (Guiffroy) of Cerdagne, who was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> several times (1019-79); Guy Goulques (1259-65), who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the title of <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> (1265-1268); Bernard de Farges (1311-41), who founded the Narbonne College at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Cardinal Georges d'Amboise, Prime Minister to Louis XIII and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Narbonne from 1482 to 1485 and from 1492 to 1493; Cardinal Bri&#231;onnet (1507-14), chief instigator of the expedition of Charles VIII into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and famous for his opposition to <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a>; Giulio de' Medici (1515-23), who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the title of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> (1524-34), and <a href="../cathen/08530c.htm">Cardinal de Joyeuse</a> (1582-84). In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> the Archbishopric of Narbonne was of great importance. For four centuries its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extended over a part of Northern <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and in the eleventh century it had as suffragans the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, B&eacute;ziers, Lod&#232;ve, Uz&#232;s, Agdi, Maguelonne, Carcassonne, Elne, <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a>, <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, <a href="../cathen/15405a.htm">Vich</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a>. Important councils were held at Narbonne in 589 and in the thirteenth century, and its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> presided legally over the meetings of the Estates of Languedoc. (3) <em>The Diocese of Saint-Papoul.</em> A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> founded in 760 by Pepin the Short, and named after the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Papoul, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> near <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in the third century, was created an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> in 1317. (4) <em>The Diocese of Alet.</em> A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> founded at Alet in 813 was made an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> in 1317. <a href="../cathen/11594a.htm">Nicolas Pavillon</a>, a <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>, known for his resistance to the commands of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Alet from 1637 to 1677. (5) <em>The Diocese of Mirepoix.</em> See <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">P<font size=-2>AMIERS</font></a>.

<p>The history of this region is intimately connected with that of the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Prouille, where <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> established a religious institute for converted <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in 1206, is still a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. <a href="../cathen/12079d.htm">St. Peter of Castelnau</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> inquisitor <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> in 1208, St. Camelia, <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the same sectarians, and <a href="../cathen/08464a.htm">St. John Francis Regis</a> (1597-1640), the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, born at Fontcouverte in the Diocese of Narbonne, are specially <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the Diocese of Carcassonne. Notre-Dame de Canab&#232;s and Notre-Dame de Limoux, both of which date back to the ninth century, are still frequented by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The church of Saints-Nazaire-et-Celse at Carcassonne was rebuilt toward the end of the eleventh century, the first work upon it being blessed by <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a>, who came to Carcassonne to urge the Vicomte Bernard de Trincavel to join the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> of this church are Roman, and the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> and choir Gothic.

<p>Previously to the enforcement of the Law of 1901, there were in the Diocese of Carcassonne <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and Children of Mary Immaculate. Two important local orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> care for the sick, and teach: the Sisters of the Holy Family (mother-house at P&eacute;zenas) and the Sisters of the Holy Name of Jesus (mother-house at Lusignan). In 1900 the diocese had the following religious institutions: 7 foundling asylums, 22 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for boys, 6 for girls, 1 house of shelter, 9 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and homes for the aged, 2 houses of retreat, 8 dispensaries, 1 insane asylum, and 69 houses of <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> sisters. At the close of 1905 (the end of the period covered by the Concordat) statistics showed a population of 313,531, with 37 pastorates, 378 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (mission churches), and 40 curacies formerly supported by the State.
