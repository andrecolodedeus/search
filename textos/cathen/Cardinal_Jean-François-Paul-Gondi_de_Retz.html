<h1>Cardinal Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois-Paul-Gondi de Retz</h1>  

<p>ARCHBISHOP OF PARIS

<p>Born at the Ch&acirc;teau of Montmirail, Oct., 1614; died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 24 Aug., 1679. His father, becoming a widower, entered the Oratory, and was for a time (1643) the director of Anne of Austria. Retz destined for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although, as he himself declares, he "had neither the taste nor the disposition for it"; his preceptor was <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>. His youth was stormy, not exempt from gallantries. However, he acquired a solid <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, learned seven languages, studied sacred and profane literature and from reading Plutarch and Sallust developed a wild taste for republican maxims, and for the r&ocirc;le of conspirator. This taste reveals itself when at the age of eighteen years he wrote a book on the conspiracy of Fieschi. He imitated an Italian author named Mascardi, but while Mascardi blamed the conspiracy, the young Retz approved of it. From 1638 to 1641 he took a certain part in the plots of the Count de <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> against <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>; later, after the Count had been killed at the battle of La Marf&eacute;e (6 July, 1641), Retz devoted himself definitively to an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career. Louis XIII on his deathbed named him coadjutor to his uncle, Gondi, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; on 31 Jan., 1644, Retz was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Notre Dame, receiving the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. He soon became popular in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, and by his manner of reforming the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. This popularity brought upon him the hostility of <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>, especially as in 1649 he threw himself into the movement of the so-called Fronde against this minister. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to stir up the peasantry against the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, the Parlement, and the Duke of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>. But he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Cond&eacute;, the head of the Fronde princes, as much as he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>, and when the Prince de Cond&eacute; openly revolted against the king, Retz attached himself to the Court party.

<p>On 21 Sept., 1651, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> informed him that <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> had made him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. From that time Retz promised fidelity to the royal family, and kept his promise, still continuing however in his opposition to <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>. <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>, wishing to exile him from Court, nominated him as "Director of French Affairs at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>". This Retz refused, and, according to an expression of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, "continued to threaten with severe and intrepid mien the victorious favourite". At the instigation of <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> (16 Dec., 1652) signed an order of arrest against Retz. The latter surrendered himself, and was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Vincennes. His uncle having died on 21 March, 1654, Retz, though a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, took possession of the Archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by power of attorney. He soon resigned it in exchange for some <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and was transferred to the Ch&acirc;teau of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, pending the acceptance by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> of his abdication. He escaped, sailed for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, then went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> wished him to retain the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. A fugitive in a strange land, he then remained as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whence he directed the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in spite of <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>, by a number of letters which <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> caused to be burned successively by the public executioner. He played a decisive r&ocirc;le in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> which elected <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> in 1655. His influence at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> opposed that of Lionne, the ambassador of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Seized by the spirit of political intrigues, we find him from 1658 to 1661 travelling in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and interesting himself in the restoration of the Stuarts. The contest between Retz and <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> ended only with the death of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; and as <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, even after <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin's</a> death, did not wish Retz to return to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Retz finally resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1662, receiving as compensation the <a href="../cathen/13343b.htm">Abbey of St. Denis</a>, whose revenue of 120,000 livres was double that of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>. He established himself at the Ch&acirc;teau of Commercy.

<p>More than once he played an active part in the quarrels between <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was he who, during the conflict between <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> regarding the reservation of the Host, advised <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> to seize <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. In 1665 and 1666 he was connected with the difficulties resulting from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> against two decisions of the Sorbonne which were directed against two infallibilist publications. He tried in vain to induce the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to declare that anti-infallibilist teachings were not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, but he succeeded in preventing <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> from launching an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against the Parlement which had joined forces with the Sorbonne; then he obtained a condemnation by the Index of one of the two publications condemned by the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, and he interpreted this Act as a sort of indirect disavowal of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> which had been directed against the Sorbonne. In his memoir on the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> written in Sept., 1666, he contended that the Universal Church, in its <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a>, should be represented by <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> chosen from all the countries of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. This memoir and the dispatches written to <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and the minister Lionne are masterpieces of diplomatic language. He took a prominent part in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a> which elected <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, and even obtained eight votes in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1676 which elected <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>. He died three years later during a sojourn in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. His memoirs, which he began to write in 1671, were published for the first time in 1717; several English translations were made in 1723, 1764, and 1774. His language is admirable for its charm and suppleness; for the profoundness of his political views, and the conciseness of his moral <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> he has been compared to Tacitus. The craving for intrigue and adventure formed the basis of his character. A man of remarkable parts, he was above all a church politician rather than a churchman.
