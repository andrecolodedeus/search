<h1>Cardinal Protector</h1>  

<p>Since the thirteenth century it has been customary at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to confide to some particular <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> a special solicitude in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> for the interests of a given <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order or institute, confraternity, church, college, city, nation, etc. He was its representative or <em>orator</em> when it sought a favour or a privilege, defended it when <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> accused, and besought the aid of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> when its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, or interests were violated or imperilled. Such a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> came to be known as a cardinal protector. In ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a similar relationship existed between the client (<em>cliens</em>) and his patron (<em>patronus</em>); as the power of the city grew, a still closer analogy is visible between the Roman institution and the modern <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> protectorate. Nearly every provincial city had its <em>patronus,</em> or <em>procurator,</em> in imperial <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, usually a Roman patrician or <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>, and such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were held in high esteem. Cicero, e.g., was <em>patronus</em> of Dyrrachium (Durazzo) and of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, in which city a gilded <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> was raised to him. In time the office became hereditary in certain <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>; Suetonius, in his life of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, says that the Claudian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> (<em>gens Claudia</em>) was from ancient times (<em>antiquitus</em>) protector of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and the Peloponnesus. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> adopted this, with many other imperial institutions, as one serviceable for external administration, not that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> who first conferred this office and title sought to copy an ancient Roman usage, but because analogous conditions and circumstances created a similar situation. The office is conferred by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> through the secretary of state, sometimes by spontaneous designation of the Holy Father, sometimes at the request of those who seek such protection. Such a cardinal protector had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to place his coat-of-arms on the church, or main edifice, of the institute, or the municipal palace of the city in question. The first to hold such an office was <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Cardinal Ugolino</a> Conti (<a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>), who sought thereby to paralyze the intrigues of his many enemies at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; at the request of St. Francis himself he was named protector of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, and again by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>. <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> retained for themselves the office of protector of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. Indeed, the latter were long the only order that boasted of a cardinal protector; it was only in the fourteenth century that gradually the office was extended. As early as 1370 <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to restrain the abuses committed by the cardinal protector of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1417-31) forbade the acceptance by the protector of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order of any payment for his protection. While <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> defined more particularly the limits of the office, <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> (1691-1700) must be credited with the final regulation of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a cardinal protector.

<p>Kingdoms, empires, etc. must have had cardinal protectors previous to <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> (1378-89), since that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> forbade such <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to receive anything from the respective sovereigns of these states, lest through love of money they should be led to abet works of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. In 1424 <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> forbade the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to accept the protectorate of kings and princes, which prohibition was renewed in 1492 by <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>. This prohibition was not renewed by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in the ninth session of the Lateran Council of 1512; the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, however, were urged to exercise the office in an impartial way and without human respect. At present the only state with a cardinal protector is the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>.
