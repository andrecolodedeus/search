<h1>Cardinal de Bouillon</h1>  

<p>(Emmanuel Th&eacute;dore de la Tour d'Auvergne)

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and diplomat, b. 24 August, 1643, at Turenne, d. 2 March, 1715, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The son of Frederick Maurice, Prince of Sedan, he was of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the great Marshal Turenne. In 1658, he was appointed a canon of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>; doctor of the Sorbonne in 1667; created a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1669, at the early age of twenty-four, and, finally, provided with several rich <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and made chief almoner to <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. But Louvois, the powerful minister of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, inspired by enmity to the house of Turenne, successfully opposed certain of his demands on the king for the benefit of members of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> disappointment vented itself in a bitter satire on his royal master. This was used to effect Bouillon's downfall at court. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> then put forth great efforts to obtain the vacant Prince-Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, but could not overcome the opposition of Louvois, who secured the dignity for Clement Joseph of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Bouillon eventually regained the royal favour and was sent as ambassador to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There, contrary to the wishes of his king, he championed the cause of <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> against that of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and did all he could to prevent the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon's</a> "Explication des maximes des Saints". He was recalled to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but alleging as a reason his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as Dean of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, he refused to obey the royal order. His <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was then seized, whereupon he submitted and returned, but, on his arrival in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was exiled to his Abbey of Tournus. While in his retirement, and under the influence of bitter ennui, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> caused to be composed by <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a> his "Histoire g&eacute;n&eacute;alogique de la maison d'Auvergne" (1708, 2 vols. in fol.). From his place of retreat, also, on the breaking out of the War of the Spanish Succession, he entered into correspondence with the English Duke of Marlborough, the Earls of Orrery and <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, and others; and in 1710, after long and vainly soliciting his recall to court, he fled to the Low Countries. A warrant for his arrest was issued by the Royal Parliament, and his possessions again confiscated. But after some years spent abroad, during which the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> sent to the king numerous memoirs, endeavouring to justify his conduct, he at last succeeded in obtaining the restitution of his revenues and permission to take up his residence at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he spent in peace his last days.
