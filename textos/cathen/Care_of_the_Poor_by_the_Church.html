<h1>Care of the Poor by the Church</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Objects, history, and organization</h2>

<p>A. The care of the poor is a branch of charity. In the narrow sense charity means any exercise of mercy towards one's fellowman rooted in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. While numerous classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are fit objects for charity, the chief class is constituted by the poor. By the poor are meant <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who do not possess and cannot acquire the means of supporting life, and are thus dependent on the assistance of others. In accordance with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> command (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs40">Matthew 25:40</a>), the care of the poor is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of all the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian body</a>, so that by the works of each the welfare of the whole community may be promoted. As, however, success is most readily attained by the systematic co-operation of many, we find since the earliest days of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, side by side with the private exercise of charity, strictly conceded measures taken by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for the care of the poor. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> care of the poor is by no means a substitute for private efforts; on the contrary, it is intended to supplement, extend, and complete the work of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Modern <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a> distinguish, according to the degree of need, three kinds of poverty: <ol><li>ordinary, such as that of the hired labourer, who lives from hand to mouth, has no <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but whose wages suffices to afford him a livelihood becoming his station; as applied to this class, the care of the poor is confined to preventive measures to keep them from falling into real poverty; <li>real want, or beggary, is the condition of those who do not possess and cannot earn sufficient means to support life, and depend on charity for what is lacking; <li>extreme want, or destitution, is a state in which the means of support are lacking to such a degree that, without extraneous aid, existence is impossible.</ol>

<p>The latter two classes are the object first of curative, and then of preventive remedies.

<p>The object of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> provision for the poor is, first the removal of their immediate need, then the nullification of the demoralizing effects of poverty, encouragement, the fostering of a desire for work and independence, and thus the exercise of an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educative</a> influence on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: "the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the care of the poor". There is in addition the social object of promoting the public welfare and of procuring for the greatest possible number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> a share in the goods of material and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> civilization. From this object arise the general <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> relief of the poor: to prevent those able to earn their living from falling into poverty, to assist with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> the sick and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, to raise the religious and moral condition of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and to render social life a blessing for needy <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. The relief of the poor includes also today a number of important tasks arising from the injurious influences of capitalistic forms of production, the modern system of interest and <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> in general, and the neglect of the moral foundations of social life based on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> seeks to fulfil the objects and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of poor-relief by means of the corporal and spiritual works of mercy usually included under the name of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<p>B. The object of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief determines its relations to social politics and state provision for the poor. Social politics and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> relief of the poor have both for their object the removal of the material, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, and moral needs of the poorer classes of the community. They are essentially distinct in three points: <ol><li>the chief motive of social politics is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the chief motive of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> relief is <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity; <li>social politics considers whole groups or great classes of the people; <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> relief concerns itself essentially with the needs of the individual; the object of the former is to abolish pauperism, while the latter aims at removing individual poverty; <li>social politics aims rather at prophylactic measures, seeking to prevent the continuation and increase of poverty, while <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> relief, although also prophylactic, is mainly curative, since it relieves and, as far as possible, removes existing need.</ol>

<p>Both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> relief-work and social politics are indispensable for <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>; they act and react on each other. Justice without charity would lead to rigidity, and leave the bitterest cases of need uncared for; charity without <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> would allow thousands to suffer destitution, and save but a few. The man who is capable of earning his own livelihood needs not <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, but work and just wages.

<p>Between State provision for the poor and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> relief the relation is as follows: the State should by its social politics prepare the way for the development of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poor-relief, and should put these politics into practice against lazy <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>; on the other hand, the provision for the really poor is in the first place the business of the private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the second place of the community, and in the last place also of the State. Liberal economics as represented by Adam Smith, Richard Malthus, and David Ricardo, is based on the ancient Roman view of life, and claims exclusively for the State the task of relieving the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, since this relief does not lessen but rather increases the amount of poverty, imposes huge expenditure on the State, and inclines the lower classes to laziness. On the other hand, it must be remembered that the State should support the unalienable human <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the helpless, and promote the common weal by uplifting the needy classes. It is therefore bound not only to interest itself in the politics of pauperism (i.e. to wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on professional beggars and all malevolent exploitation of charity), but also in the private care or the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, especially today, when the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and private relief of the poor cannot possibly satisfy all the demands made upon it. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has indeed at all times emphasized the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the State in promoting the welfare of the people. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII's</a> <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> on the question of the working man (1891) assigns to the State tasks which come under the programme of poor-relief. The part played by the State should however be only subsidiary; the chief r&ocirc;le should be regularly filled by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> relief and neighbourly charity, since thus alone will the principle of spontaneous generosity and individuality be retained, inasmuch as State relief rests on compulsory taxation and always remains bureaucratic. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> therefore asserts her innate right to care for the poor together and in conjunction with the State, and condemns the agitation for a state monopoly of poor-relief as a violation of a principle of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The political side of pauperism does indeed pertain to the State; in the actual relief of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, however, Church and community should co-operate. While the institutions founded by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are to be administered by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be allowed to exercise also in State institutions her <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educative</a> and moral influence. Close co-operation between <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, public, and private poor-relief effectually prevents its exploitation by unworthy <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>.



<p>C. Ecclesiastical relief of the poor is condemned by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (e.g. in recent times by Dr. Uhlhorn) who assert that it is unmethodical, uncritical, and without organization, and consequently fosters begging and exercises a harmful influence. To this we may reply: <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> disapproves of everything irrational, and therefore also a <em>priori</em> of disorganized and uncritical care of the poor. But the surveillance must not be injurious or degrading to the poor. Without transgressing the boundaries of charity and respect for the dignity of man, the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> distinctly demands discretion in the giving of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and condemns professional begging (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm#vrs11">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs13">1 Timothy 5:13 sqq.</a>). The whole range of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature and even the greatest friends of the poor among the teachers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> peremptorily insist upon order and distinction being employed in relieving the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, warn against the encouragement of lazy beggars, and declare that one may as little support laziness as immorality; <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> received poor-relief must be restored. Ecclesiastical relief of the poor has from the very beginning been very well organized, the organization being changed in every century to suit the changing conditions of the times. Not in those places where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has controlled poor-relief but in those where the State or other powers have interfered with its administration, have disorder and a want of discrimination been apparent.

<p>The latest opponents of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief are the extreme Individualists and Socialists. Denying a future existence, professing an extreme Evolutionism and Relativism, upholding in the moral sphere the autonomy of the individual, and proclaiming <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on rank (i.e. a class <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>), they condemn all benefactions as prejudicial to the dignity of man and to the welfare of the community. Friedrich Nietzsche, as an extreme Individualist, sees in boundless competition &#151; a battle of all against all, which necessarily means the downfall of the weak and the poor &#151; the means of securing the greatest possible personal welfare. Socialism, as represented by Carl Marx and Carl Kautsky, proclaims a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the propertyless against the propertied classes, a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> whose energy is paralyzed and impaired (they assert) by charitable activity. In a criticism of Nietzsche's teaching, it must be emphasized that the superman is a mere phantasy without any <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> or historical foundation whatever. Even the strongest man is dependent on the civilization of the past and present, and on the social organization. Against the forces of nature, against the accumulated treasures of civilization, against the combination of adverse circumstances, he is powerless. Even the strongest-willed man may be in the next moment the most piteous mortal in extreme need of charity. If a man make himself the centre of all his objects, he challenges all men to battle. The theory of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the strong has as its final consequence the reduction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> to a horde of warring barbarians. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality, on the other hand, distinguishes between just <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of self, which includes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of neighbour, and the self-love which it combats and condemns. In appraising the value of the socialistic theory which declares poor-relief a disgrace alike to <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and the receiver of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, we may observe: Even if we were disposed to grant that in the socialistic state of the future all moral defects and their consequences will be removed (for which there is not the least <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>), the physical causes of poverty would be still present. Even in the future there will be <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, invalids, and the helpless aged; to these no bureaucratic central authority, but sympathetic charity can afford a sufficient help. The acceptance of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> on the part of the guiltless poor is indeed for these a certain <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, but in no way a disgrace. Otherwise it would be a disgrace to accept the gifts of nature and civilization, which we ourselves have not earned, and which form the greater part of our material and spiritual possessions. It is however a shame and bitter <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to replace just wages by <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. This is so far from being the object of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> relief of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality expressly condemns it as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against distributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But all objections against <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief will be most easily met by a glance at its history.

<p>D. The history of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief is difficult, because, in accordance with the command of Christ (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs3">Matthew 6:3</a>), it for the most part avoids publicity, deals with <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and is to a great extent influenced by social institutions. We will confine ourselves to brief notices of the most important historical phenomena.

<p>(1) As a natural characteristic of man, human sympathy was active even among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, who, however, recognized no moral <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to render assistance, since the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a common origin and destiny and of the equality of men before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was wanting. Isolated suggestions of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> of neighbourly charity are found in the writings of Cicero, Seneca, Epictetus, and <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, but these writers were powerless to convert wide circles to more humane sentiments. Consequently, a public and general care of the poor existed nowhere in antiquity, but only isolated suggestions thereof. In Athens Pisistratus made provision for needy war-invalids and citizens, and the application of this provision was later extended to all residents whom infirmity rendered unable to work. Special officials, the sitarchs, were also appointed to prevent a shortage of corn. Similar institutions existed in other Greek towns. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the poor regulations from the time of Julius C&aelig;sar, and the donations of corn especially after the time of C&aelig;sar and <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> must be regarded as simply political measures designed to soothe the Roman proletariat clamouring for bread and games. The same may be said of the children's <em>alimentaturia</em> founded by Nerva and Hadrian and perfected by <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, of the institutions for providing for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> in numerous towns in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, supported from the imperial purse, and of the later private foundations of the same kind under State supervision to be found in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and in the different provinces. Under the Empire the colleges of artisans were bound to provide for their impoverished colleagues. The efforts of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> to plant <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poor-relief on <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> soil with the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> high-priest, Arsatinus, met with scant success.

<p>(2) The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> established a preventive poor-relief, contained numerous provisions in favour of needy <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and expressly commands the giving of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> (<a href="../bible/deu015.htm#vrs11">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>). These <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the Law were strongly inculcated by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. The Divine command of charity towards one's neighbour is clearly expressed in the Law (<a href="../bible/lev019.htm#vrs18">Leviticus 19:18</a>), but the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> regarded as their neighbour only the members of their race and strangers living in their territories. The [<a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> further intensified this narrow interpretation into scorn for <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for personal enemies (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs37">Matthew 5:37</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs33">Luke 10:33</a>). Measures of preventive poor-relief were the decisions of the Law concerning the division of the land among the tribes and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, the inalienableness of landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and Jubilee year, <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, the gathering of grapes and corn, the third <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>, etc.

<p>(3) <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> compared <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of neighbour with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; proclaimed as its prototype the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Heavenly Father and His own reclaiming <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; and taught the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the propertied classes towards the poor. His own life of poverty and want and the principle, "As long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me", conceded to works of mercy a claim to eternal reward, and to the needy of every description the hope of kindly relief. In the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> lie the germs of all the charitable activity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has appeared ever in new forms throughout the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> centuries.

<p>(4) In Apostolic times poor-relief was closely connected with the Eucharist through the oblations and agap&aelig; and through the activity of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> (<a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs11">Acts 6:11 sqq.</a>). Among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> there was <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> community of the use of goods, though probably not community of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs37">Acts 4:37</a>; <a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs12">12:12</a>). The care of the poor was such that no one could be said to be in need (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs34">Acts 2:34, 44, 45</a>; <a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs32">4:32 sqq.</a>). By the institution of a common purse, administered first by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and later by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, poor-relief received a public character. The public relief of the poor was to be completed by private charity (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs14">1 Timothy 5:14</a>). Private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> had to care first for members of their own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, the neglect of whom was likened with apostasy (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs4">1 Timothy 5:4, 8, 16</a>), then for needy members of their community, then for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of other communities, and finally for non-Christians (<a href="../bible/gal006.htm#vrs10">Galatians 6:10</a>). The Apostles proclaimed the high moral dignity and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of work: "If any man will not work, neither let him eat" (<a href="../bible/2th003.htm#vrs10">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>); forbade intercourse with the lazy (loc. cit., 11), who are unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community (6 sqq.); and forbade the support of lazy beggars (<a href="../bible/1th002.htm#vrs9">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="../bible/1th004.htm#vrs11">4:11</a>; <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs28">Ephesians 4:28</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs3">1 Timothy 5:3, 13</a>). Almsgiving  is for the propertied <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of merciful charity; the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, however, have no claim thereto; they should be modest and thankful (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#vrs6">1 Timothy 6:6, 8, 10, 17</a>).

<p>(5) In sub-Apostolic times, especially during the persecutions, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> continues to be the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> and the director of poor-relief. His assistants were the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>. To the office of <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> at first only <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, but later also elderly spinsters were admitted (<a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs1">Romans 16:1</a>; <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs5">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs9">1 Timothy 5:9</a>). In addition to assisting at the Divine services and at giving instruction, they had to visit the sick and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, to care for poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, etc. Individual provision for the poor and visitation of the poor in their houses in accordance with a special list (<em><a href="../cathen/10052a.htm">matricula</a></em>) were strictly practised in every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community. Alms were given only after close examination into the conditions, and the abuse of charity by strangers was prevented by <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> newcomers to work and demanding letters of recommendation. No lazy beggar might be supported (Didache, XI, xii; Constit. Apost., II, iv; III vii 6). It was sought to make the poor independent by assigning them work, procuring them positions, giving them tools etc. <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphans</a> and foundlings were entrusted to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> for adoption and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> (Const. Apost., IV, i); poor boys were entrusted to master artisans for instruction (loc. cit., ii). The sources from which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> derived its receipts for poor-relief were: the surplus of the oblations at the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> of the Mass, the offerings of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> (<em>Collecta</em>) at the beginning of the service, the alms-box, the firstlings for the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> (Const. Apost., VIII, xxx), the yield of the money collections made regularly on fast days and also in times of special need, and finally the free contributions.

<p>(6) After the time of Constantine, who granted the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to acquire <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> possessions grew, thanks to the numerous gifts of land, foundations, and the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> which gradually became established (from the sixth century) also in the West. The defects of Roman legislation in this respect, the incessant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, the crowding of the poor into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> made the task of relieving the poor ever more difficult. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> administered the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, being assisted in the superintendence of poor-relief by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, and in many places by special <em>conomi</em> or by the archpresbyters or <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>. In the West the division of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> income into four parts (for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, church building, and poor-relief) began in the fourth century. In addition to the provision for the poor in their homes, the increasing mass of poverty demanded a new institution &#151; the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. It was to serve for a special class of the needy, and was the regular completion of the general charitable activity of the district. Such institutions for the collective care of the poor were: the <em>diaconi </em>, great store-houses near the church, where the poor daily enjoyed meals in common; the <em>henodochi </em>, for strangers; the <em>nosocomi</em> for the sick; the <em>orphanotrophi</em> and <em>brephotrophi</em> for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and foundlings; the <em>gerontocomi</em> for the aged. Of special importance was the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> <em>Basilias</em> erected by <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> in C&aelig;sarea about 369 for all classes of the needy. At the end of the sixth century <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and poorhouses existed in great numbers in all the divisions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territories. They were all under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and managed by a special <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>. The sick were nursed by <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and attendants under them (see <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">HOSPITALS</a>).

<p>(7) After <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (d. 604), who organized poor-relief on a model basis in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and urged <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and secular rulers to rational works of provision for the needy, the spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to the country parts and to the Germanic and Anglo-Saxon nomadic tribes led to the gradual extension of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> system, which dates from the fourth century; this movement was accompanied by the decentralization of poor-relief. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> retained the direction of the poor-relief of his city, and the dealing with special crises of need in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; on the other hand, first in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and afterwards in wider circles, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were, in accordance with the decrees of the Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> (567), to maintain their poor at their own cost, in order that these might not wander into other communities. Since the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> new centres of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief were found in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, first those of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, later those of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, Pr&aelig;monstratensians etc. These constituted the main factor in the preventive and curative poor-relief; gave an example of work; taught the uncivilized peoples agriculture, handicrafts, and the arts; trained the youth; erected and maintained hospices for strangers and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> for the sick. A mighty spur to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and private poor-relief was supplied by the replacing of canonical penances by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and the devoting of whole or part of one's fortune to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> legacies for one's own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or for that of another.

<p>(8) From the days of Constantine civil legislation supported <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief by granting privileges in favour of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> foundations, legacies, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> etc. The State also adopted from the time of Emperors Gratian, <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian II</a>, and Justinian, measures against lazy beggars. The later Merovingians diverted to some extent <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> from its proper objects and disorganized poor-relief. In his capitularies <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> created a state-ecclesiastical organization for providing for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and strictly forbade vagabondage (806). His organization was revived by King St. Louis (d. 1270), who sought to make the communities responsible for the support of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> poor-relief.

<p>(9) During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> properly so-called there is an important distinction between poor-relief in the city and in the country. The <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> system, which had become established in the tenth century, threw the care of impoverished servants and serfs, and thus of the greater number of the poor of the country districts, on the lord of the manor. In addition the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> worked for the poor of his flock, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and foundations for strangers and the sick.

<p>(10) Provision for the poor was splendidly developed in the cities of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Its administrators were &#151; in addition to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> &#151; the guilds, corporations, and confraternities. The <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> cared for the sick, the poor in their houses, and travellers; the guilds, for sick and impoverished members and their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>; the distress guilds, for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and travellers. Special religious congregations cared for the sick and prepared medicines &#151; e.g. the <a href="../cathen/07543a.htm">Humiliati</a>, the Jesuati, the Brothers of the Holy Ghost, the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines and Beghards</a>, and, since the thirteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. The pawn-offices (<em>montes pietatis</em>) established in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the loan <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> founded by Bishop Giberti of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> (1528), served as repressive poor-relief.

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to assert that municipal regulations in aid of the poor were a fruit of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> municipal magistrates, in conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, already made extensive provision for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, endeavoured to stop begging by ordinances and police-regulations, supported the real poor and municipal institutions, and fostered the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, in so far as this was not provided for by relations and the guilds. In general, <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> poor-relief was in no way lacking in organization; in the country districts the organization was indeed perfect; in the towns the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, magistrates, guilds, confraternities, and private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> vied with one another in providing for the poor with such discrimination and practical adaptability that in normal times the provision satisfied all demands, extraordinary calamities alone overtaxing it. The frightful growth of beggary at the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> arose, not from the failure of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief, but from the relative over-population of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> civilized countries and other economical conditions of the time. The lack of a central administration exercised by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, after the model of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> relief, constituted indeed a defect in organization.

<p>(11) The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> destroyed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/06157b.htm">ecclesiastical foundations</a>, which were for the most part applied to secular objects. The terrible <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries aggravated the misery caused by the secularization of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> which had maintained poor-relief to such an extent that poverty, begging, crime, want, and public insecurity grew unchecked. The poor-regulations of the towns were almost entirely ineffectual, and the State governments entered on a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> with poverty and vagabondage by inflicting severe punishments, and, in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the penalty of death. In opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition, the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> championed public relief of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, administered by the secular community and the State, and substituted for the principle of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> the home principle. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the secularization of poor-relief began with the imperial police regulations of 1530; in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> Francis II extended the compulsory <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the community to give and the right of the poor to claim support, decreed by <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to all his territories. It was but to be expected that poor-relief should be secularized also in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1536); this provision was followed in 1575 by the legal institution of poorhouses, and in 1601 by the celebrated Poor Law of Queen Elizabeth. This state continued until 1834, when the reform which had been found absolutely indispensable was effected.

<p>(12) The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> renewed the ancient <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to provide for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, especially to supervise the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> (Sess. VII de Ref., cap. xv; Sess. XXV de Ref., cap. viii) and the employment of the income from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> (Sess. XXV de Ref., cap. i). In accordance with these decrees, numerous <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> laboured to improve <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief. <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (d. 1584), worked with special <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and great ability. Simultaneously there arose especially for the care of the poor and the sick and for the training of poor children a number of new orders and congregations &#151; e.g.: the Order of Brothers of Mercy, the Clerics Regular of St. Camillus of Lellis, the Somaschans, the Order of St. Hippolytus in Mexico, the Bethlemites, the Hospitaller Sisters, the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>. Fundamental and exemplary was the activity of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> (d. 1660). In 1617 he founded the <em>Confr&eacute;ie de la Charit&eacute;</em>, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> association which, under the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, was to provide for the poor and the sick; in 1634 he founded the Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, a visiting institute under religious discipline, which has for centuries <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> its efficacy in caring for the sick and in making provision for the poor; it combines centralization and strict discipline in administration with decentralization and adaptability in the relief of the poor.

<p>(13) The secularization of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and the succeeding period (1804) dealt a severe blow to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief. Comprehensive poor-laws were passed by several <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> states, but in no case were they such as to make <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief dispensable.

<p>(14) Since the middle of the nineteenth century the development of industries, the growth of cities and freedom of emigration have reduced large numbers of the population to poverty, and necessitated gigantic expenditure on the part of the community and State. The States sought by the legal protection of labour in the form of workmen's insurance, factory <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and commercial regulations, to prevent poverty and to render stricter and perfect the poor-regulations. Legislation is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return to the old <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> principle of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the neighbouring countries the "Elberfelder System" was adopted for the public care of the poor; this is based on personal contact between the almoner and the impoverished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and combines the communal and private charitable activities. In South <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, the communities employ more than formerly private bodies in their poorhouses and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, religious congregations &#151; e.g., the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/14578a.htm">Father Theodosius Florentini</a> (1844, 1852) &#151; being entrusted with the internal administration of such State institutions. Regulations concerning the communities and establishments for poor-relief have been inaugurated widely today in districts, provinces, countries, and states.

<p>(15) In addition to this state provision for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief has developed in recent times not merely in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, but also in an incalculable number of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. We shall name only the <em>cr&egrave;ches</em>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for young children institutions for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, weaklings, the deaf and dumb, the blind, cripples, unprotected children, protectories, Sunday-schools, protectorates for apprentices, the International Association for the Protection of Girls, the Railway Mission, hospices for servants, workwomen, fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> exposed to danger, the provision for liberated criminals, for emigrants, and the aged; <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> charitable associations (e.g., The <em>Elizabethen</em> &#151; and <em>Ludwigsvereine</em>); the men's associations for poor-relief including the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a> (founded 1833), the Charitable Students' Circles, the legal bureaux, the colonies of workmen, the temperance movement, and the inebriate asylums.

<p>(16) While politico-religious <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> destroys <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> and persecutes the charitable congregations, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of neighbour continues to find new ways of providing for the poor. The necessity of securing unanimity of purpose among the various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions for the relief of the poor has called into life various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and national unions for the organization of charity &#151; e.g.: The <em>Caritasverband f&uuml;r Deutschland</em> (1897), the Austrian <em>Reichsverband der katholischen Wohlt&auml;tigskeitsorganisation</em> (1900), the <em>Caritasfaktion der schweizerische Katholikenveneins</em> (1899). On the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> side, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> care of the poor is organized especially by the Home Missions.

<p>E. The organization of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> today to bind together, after the fashion of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charitable activity for the repression and prevention of poverty, all religious monastic, private, corporate, state, and communal forces aiming at this object; while the varying national and local conditions demand a great diversity in organization, in general the following must be the guiding principles:

<p>(1) For <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and centre of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organization. He directs undertakings affecting the entire or a great portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and regulates and supervises the general charitable activity of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>;

<p>(2) The local <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> is the immediate director of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> poor-relief of his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Monastic orders labouring in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, charitable lay associations, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and institutes for the poor and sick are all under his direction. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-priest should endeavour to co-operate as far as possible with the secular and private poor-relief of his district, and also with the local authorities, so as to secure regular and uniform action;

<p>(3) The local provision for the poor should be as far as possible confined to the home, promoting personal contact between the helper and the poor; the assistance should be as a rule given in goods, the abuse of gifts of money being guarded against as far as practical;

<p>(4) Ecclesiastical poor-relief embraces all classes of the needy, consideration being shown for feelings of mortification and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> pride. The keeping of a list of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> is indispensable;

<p>(5) The means are to be obtained from the income from foundations, from the regular and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> contributions of the parishioners, and, in case of necessity, from extraordinary collections. Sometimes local poor-relief is combined with the charitable organizations of the neighbourhood;

<p>(6) Repressive provision for the poor concerns itself in the first place with those able to work, especially with: <ul><li>children, who are placed for training either with relatives, with trustworthy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, or in <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>. While maintenance in a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is preferable, no general rule can be laid down on this point. A new task is the charitable provision for children, who are uncared for by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and who are morally unprotected (cf. The <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <em>F&uuml;rsorgeerziehungsgesetz</em> of 1897); <li>sick and decrepit <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who are assisted either with gifts of goods, food, medicine etc. in their homes, or are placed in poor-houses or <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>.</ul>

<p>Repressive provision for the poor is also directed towards <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> able to work, who can earn their livelihood and do not do so. If this is the result of obstinate laziness, and an inclination to begging and vagabondage, the State should confine the offenders in institutions of compulsory labour, or engage them on useful works, paying them wages and supporting them. Should, however, it arise from inability to find employment, the State should interfere by inaugurating relief-works, comprehensive organization of information as to labour conditions, fostering private relief measures, workers' colonies etc.

<p>(7) Preventive poor-relief seeks to prevent the fall into poverty. This is never entirely successful, but it may become partially so by the combination of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, State, trade organizations, and private charitable agencies along the following lines: <ul><li>by <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> the youth to thrift, establishment of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> savings banks and especially fostering economy among the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes; <li>by state and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> insurance against illness; <li>by making the employer responsible for accidents befalling his employees; <li>insurance against old age and incapacitation, organized on trades union or State principles; <li>by the express inculcation of the mutual <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of members of the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and relatives according to the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; <li><a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the passion for pleasure and a social legislation guided by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> principles.</ul>

<h2 id="section2">In Canada</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> has numerous <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. As early as 1638 the <a href="../cathen/01233e.htm">Duchesse d'Aiguillon</a> founded, at the instance of the missionaries, the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu of Quebec, where the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of the Mercy of Jesus have since devoted themselves to the care of the sick poor. They have also care of the General Hospital of Quebec (1693), the Sacred Heart Hospital (1873), and the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu of <a href="../cathen/03658a.htm">Chicoutimi</a> (1884). In 1642 <a href="../cathen/09584a.htm">Jeanne Mance</a> founded the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, which in 1659 was confided to the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of St. Joseph. Mgr de Saint-Vallier (who had already founded the General Hospital of Quebec, and whose will contained the words: "Forget me, but do not forget my poor") in 1697 requested the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> to found a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>. This <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was placed in charge of the Sisters of Providence in 1886. The General Hospital of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (founded 1694) was entrusted in 1747 to <a href="../cathen/15736c.htm">Mme d'Youville</a>, foundress of the <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a>. This congregation, whose object is the care of foundlings, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, the sick, the aged, and the infirm, was the origin of other independent communities engaged in the same work, namely the <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a> at St. Hyacinthe (1840), the <a href="../cathen/07031b.htm">Grey Nuns of the Cross</a> at Ottawa (1845), the <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a> of Charity at Quebec (1849), and the <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a> at <a href="../cathen/11069a.htm">Nicolet</a> (1886). These communities, which are spread throughout <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, accomplish wonderful <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> in behalf of the poor. More recent foundations are allied with them, among the most important being the Sisters of Providence (founded at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> in 1843 by Mme Gamelin), who devote themselves to the spiritual and temporal relief of the poor and sick, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and aged, the visitation and care of the sick in their homes, dispensaries, refuges, and workrooms. They have eighty-five establishments. At <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, and Quebec there is a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the Protection of Young Girls, as also the Layette Society, an association of charitable <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> which assists poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> at the period of the birth of children. The above table, though necessarily incomplete, affords an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the number and variety of charitable activity in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>.

<p>The Church carries out these undertakings, at least in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, almost entirely with the assistance of private charity. In 1902 the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu of Quebec received free 1052 sick poor, whose stay at the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> represented 30,892 days of board and treatment. The sisters receive from the Government an annual allowance of $448, but nothing from the city, and they pay the water tax. In 1910 the Sisters of Charity of Quebec had 538 old men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and 1704 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>; they received $1498 from the Government and paid to the city $1050 for water. In 1911 the Government of Quebec granted a subsidy of $56,875.75 to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. In <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> the Government pays 20 cents a day for 120 days and 7 cents a day for subsequent days for each patient admitted to a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>; the cities also pay their quota. In 1909 the subsidies paid by the provincial Government to <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, infirmaries, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> amounted to $257,813.53. The <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a> was established at Quebec in 1846 by Dr. Joseph Painchaud. Conferences were formed at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1848), Toronto (1850), Ottawa (1860), and Hamilton (1866). The superior council for all <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> is located at Quebec. In 1896 it numbered 104 conferences; its receipts for the year equalled $64,000 and its expenses $53,000. During the past fifty years the Quebec conferences have expended $577,069.98 on the poor. In 1909 the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> numbered 97 French conferences with 4228 members and 59 English conferences with 1039 members. The receipts equalled $162,199.46 and the expenditures $126,316.12. Relief was given to 2900 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, composed of 11,524 <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Besides visiting the poor in their homes, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has organized patronages for the instruction of poor children and night shelters for the homeless, and finds homes with <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphaned</a> apprentices. In recent years it has been assisted by the Guignol&eacute;e collection made for the poor on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a> by the Association of Commercial Travellers. In 1910 this collection amounted to more than $8000.

<h2 id="section3">In Great Britain and Ireland</h2>

<p>In the British Isles two different types of organizations deal with the care of the poor: <ul><li>public statutory bodies; <li>voluntary associations.</ul>

<p>Under the former may be included Parliament, which makes <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> affecting the care of the poor and local bodies, such as county, borough, town, and district councils, and more particularly the boards of guardians which administer them. The tendency of modern legislation has been to transfer certain sections of work affecting the poor from boards of guardians to other local bodies. As <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, public health, pension, and asylum authorities, municipal bodies other than boards of guardians now deal with feeding necessitous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> children, medical inspection and treatment of children attending the elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the after-care of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> children, scholarships, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for defective children, inspection of laundries, workshops, common lodging houses, and houses let in tenements, the allocation of old age pensions, and the provision and management of all forms of asylums for the insane and epileptic. All public statutory bodies dealing with the care of the poor obtain their funds from taxes or rates, to which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> as citizens contribute either directly or indirectly. In Great Britain until recently <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had few organizations for securing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> representation upon public bodies. Within the last few years, however, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Federation movement has spread in different parts of the country. This aims at encouraging <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to take their share in public affairs by becoming candidates for public office (not necessarily as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but as ordinary citizens), and to safeguard <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests by putting test questions to all candidates on matters affecting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in order to afford guidance to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> voters. By these efforts, and notably by the exertions of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have secured some representation upon public bodies, though not in proportion to their numbers. In the House of Commons elected in January, 1910, there were 9 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> members out of 495 for constituencies in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, but none out of 72 in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. No figures for municipal bodies are available, but in many of the larger towns in Great Britain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have representation (for example, the London County Council has 5 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> members out of 137). <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have greatest representation upon boards of guardians which exist directly for the care of the poor. This is due mainly to the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Guardians Association (founded in 1894), which forms a centre for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> guardians, holds an annual conference, gives legal advice, conducts negotiations with Government departments, and assists in various ways. Out of 24,000 members of boards of guardians in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> 540 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, of course, except in a few districts in the north, a large proportion of the members of all public bodies are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>: out of 103 members of Parliament, for example, 74 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>In Legislation affecting the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> members of Parliament by their influence have safeguarded <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. In acts, for example, dealing with defective children, provisions have been inserted which secure to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> the right under certain conditions to have their children sent to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>: in the recent Children's Act similar restrictions have also been inserted. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> members of municipal councils have in many cases secured the appointment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> co-opted members upon the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> committees, considerate treatment for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children in the administration of the Provision of Meals (Education) Act, in the medical treatment and inspection of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> children, in the work of the Children's Care Committees, and in the carrying out of the Industrial Schools Acts: they have also in many cases obtained satisfactory provision for, religious observances for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inmates of lunatic asylums, remand homes, inebriate homes, and the like. The efforts of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Guardians have gained great advantages for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in many districts, such as the appointment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religious instructors in workhouses and infirmaries, facilities for Mass and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> for the inmates of poor law institutions either within or without these establishments, arrangements for recognized <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> visitors to workhouses and infirmaries and the safeguarding of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children by Securing their transfer to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> poor law <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Indeed, beyond the benefits to their own coreligionists, to the influence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> guardians may be attributed in no small degree the improved administration of the Poor Law in recent years. A striking witness to the value of their efforts in this respect may be found in the anxiety shown by those interested in the reports of the recent Royal Commission on the Poor Law to secure the support of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for their particular views.

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> influence the care of the poor through <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> organizations, either by participating in the work of general agencies or by their own efforts on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lines. The more important philanthropic bodies, such as the Charity Organization Society, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Children's Country Holiday Fund, or the public <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> supported by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> funds, all include many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> amongst their members, with the result that these bodies usually willingly co-operate with recognized <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organizations, whenever <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> applicants for relief have to be considered.

<p>In the absence of official statistics, it is difficult to estimate accurately the extent of charitable work amongst the poor by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> themselves as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission, with a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, serves as a centre for such work. Poor <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in distress instinctively turn to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who, if he has no suitable charitable organization attached to his church, usually acts as almoner himself. Some approximate <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the extent of such work may be gathered from the fact that in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> there are 1773 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and stations with 3747 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the corresponding figures for <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> being 394 and 555, and for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> 2468 and 3645. Similarly, an extraordinary amount of charitable work is regularly carried out by the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, especially by those of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who devote their lives to personal service amongst the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, such as the Sisters of Charity, the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, the Sisters of Nazareth, the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, the Little Company of Mary, and others. Almost every possible form of charitable assistance is undertaken by these communities in different parts of the three countries. <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphanages</a> for boys and girls, poor law <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, homes for physically and mentally defective children, homes for the aged, night refuges for the destitute, reformatories, training homes for servants, homes for working boys and girls, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, hospices for the dying, convalescent homes, holiday homes in the country and at the seaside, working girls' clubs, homes for penitents, refuges for fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, homes for inebriates, visiting the sick, nursing the sick poor, instructing the deaf and dumb in their religion, are all amongst the charitable works under the care of religious. Some of these have deservedly gained a national reputation for the standard of excellence reached &#151; for example, St. Vincent's Industrial School for boys; Dartford (under the <a href="../cathen/12399b.htm">Presentation Brothers</a>); the Home for the Aged Poor; Nazareth House, Hammersmith (under Sisters of Nazareth); and the Blind Asylum, Merrion, Dublin (under the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Sisters of Charity), to mention only a few. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, whose work is not directly charitable, nevertheless, are, like the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, regularly called upon to act the part of almoners. The number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, including branch houses, in the three countries must exceed 1000, but this number does not afford any criterion of the extent of the work accomplished by them. A good example, admittedly well above the average, taken from one of the largest towns, will serve as an illustration. Situated in a very poor district, with twenty sisters in the community, a Convent of Mercy, besides supplying nine sisters as teachers in two elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, has charge of a night refuge for nearly 300 men, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and children, a servants' home, a home for young working <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and a soup kitchen, and its religious regularly visit the sick in a large <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> poor in the district.

<p>The principal charitable <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> organization for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> men is the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, which flourished both in Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>: in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, it has 274 local conferences with 3523 active members; in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, 95 conferences with 1316 active members; in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 200 conferences with 3134 active members. By personal service amongst the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> poor, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> unostentatiously carries on a considerable amount of charitable work. It practises many forms of assistance, including feeding the hungry, visiting the sick in their homes and in the public infirmaries and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, visiting the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, attending the children's courts to watch <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cases, finding employment for those out of work, acting as catechists for poor boys in Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and bringing them to Mass and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> assisting in the formation and management of boys' clubs and brigades, and the like. The local conferences are grouped into councils which hold quarterly meetings of all members to discuss topics of general interest. No general <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a> flourishes throughout the three countries, but kindred organizations, whose objects are similar in scope, thrive in different parts, such as St. Elizabeth's Society, the Ladies of Charity, and Ladies' Settlements. All these resemble the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a> in aiming primarily at the personal edification of the worker, as well as at the spiritual and temporal benefit of those assisted. These organizations, however, do not confine their efforts to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and girls, but take a large part in work amongst boys. A ladies' settlement in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, for example, includes in its scheme of work visiting the sick and poor, instruction for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, mothers' meetings, a men's club, a girls' club, a clothing club, a sewing class, the provision of free meals for children, evening classes etc.

<p>One of the most striking developments of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> work amongst the poor in recent years, especially in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, has been the organization of rescue <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children in danger. Mixed <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, poverty, misfortune, neglect, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> living, are amongst the many causes which, particularly in the larger towns, contribute towards placing in jeopardy the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of little ones. The children of a <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriage</a>, in which the father is a non-Catholic, who seek admission to a poor law institution, are held at law to be of the same religion as the father. The rescue <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> save such children by placing them in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> homes. Children of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are sometimes by mistake entered in non-Catholic poor law <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The rescue <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> watch carefully all such cases, rectifying any mistakes made. The children of neglectful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are not infrequently brought to the notice of non-Catholic organizations, which are willing to assist them, if <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> fail to do so; in such cases the rescue <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are always too ready to proffer their aid. In Great Britain, eight <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> have organized rescue <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, which deal with many hundreds of children each year, but every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has its poor law <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, or its industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children can be received. As an outcome of the work of the rescue <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Emigration Association has been in existence in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for some years past, which arranges for the emigration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> after leaving the rescue institutions in order to remove them completely from any danger of falling back into their early <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> surroundings. This association has a receiving home in <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, whence the young emigrants are placed out with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> farmers and their progress is watched until they come of age.

<p>Certain other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, which flourish in some form or other in the three countries, carry on very useful social work: the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Prisoners' Aid Society (with branches in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, and other large towns, not necessarily connected, but working on similar lines), which assists <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> on leaving <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and endeavours to start them in life again; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Needlework Guild, whose members bind themselves each year to provide a certain number of useful garments for the poor; and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Boys' Brigade, whose aim is to unite <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> boys as they leave the elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, to keep them in touch with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to provide in various ways for their spiritual, physical, and social well-being.

<p>The great drawback to all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> social efforts is, undoubtedly, the lack of intercommunication between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> workers in different parts. Two organizations have, however, recently been started, which as they spread will probably tend to remove this defect: the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Women's League, which has already in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> established a social information bureau, and has succeeded in bringing together <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> workers from all parts of the country; and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Social Guild, for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> social study, which many hope will eventually develop into a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Institute of Social Service for Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, upon lines which have already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> so useful in other countries.

<h2 id="section4">In the United States</h2>

<p>This description is confined to methods followed in serving the poor outside of institutions strictly so called, and does not include institutional works conducted by <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, which are described elsewhere under appropriate headings, nor relief given by <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, as the spirit and method in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charity come to best expression through organization. Furthermore, the need of organization and the approval of it become daily more and more pronounced. Individuals contribute with increasing generosity to organizations, and refer to them the applications for relief which they meet. A sense of responsibility toward the poor will be found in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, the city as such, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community whether of men or of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and each accordingly engage in relief work. In our greater cities a tendency is found to establish central offices through which all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charities may be co-ordinated. A similar movement toward co-ordination of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> charities is also found. General meetings of charitable organizations of all kinds for purposes of discussion and improvement of methods occur with increasing frequency. Finally, there are organizations which undertake particular works and gradually expand activity until they include representation from a large number of cities and states in their organization.

<p>The combination of all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charities in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> into one vast national conference has just been begun under the name "The National Conference of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Charities's. The aims of the Conference, much like those of all similar charitable organizations, are the following: (1) <ul><li>to bring about exchange of views among experienced <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who are active in the work of charity; <li>to collect and publish information concerning organization, problems, and results in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charity; <li>to bring to expression a general policy toward distinctive modern questions in relief and prevention and towards methods and tendencies in them; <li>to encourage further development of a literature in which the religious and social ideals of charity shall find dignified expression.</ul>

<p>Relief problems will differ somewhat with the locality and with the character of those in need. This is particularly the case in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> where city population is so heterogeneous. It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> therefore, to confine this description to typical methods, excluding those peculiar to any locality. Furthermore, no attempt is made to indicate quantities in relief work or extent in organization. The methods described are the methods actually found in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> circles, which are to a large extent like those followed in organized charity generally, but differ in motive and spirit and the degree in which certain principles are followed or certain factors emphasized.

<p>Information concerning the needs of the poor reaches the organization through many channels. Application may be made directly by those in want. Members of an organization while working among the poor whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> are constantly discovering new cases. Other charitable organizations, whether secular or religious, will usually notify a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> when they discover <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in want. Teaching sisters in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are frequently able to render most efficient service through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which they obtain of the needs of poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. Policemen report cases of which they learn. The ministrations of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the prompt instinctive turning of these to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> when distress comes, enable the latter to place information concerning every conceivable plight of the needy in the hands of the charitable organization. We thus find a fairly complete network of factors through which relief agencies are enabled to obtain early <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and give prompt assistance. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the tendency in many poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> to hide their suffering and bear privation in silence baffles the watchfulness of all agencies, but on the whole these factors in the work of relief are extremely helpful.

<p>Once it is discovered that relief is needed an experienced member of an organization is directed to take charge of the case immediately. If an emergency is found immediate relief is given without question, otherwise such inquiry is instituted as will bring out the cause of the distress together with the kind and degree of relief needed. Relatives are sought out if there are any in position to take care of the case, former employers or even friends who might be willing to assist are looked for, and appeal is made to them. If there are no such relations discovered, the charitable organization assumes charge of the case and accepts full responsibility for it. From that moment, personal attention and service will be given to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or individual as long as may be needed. Spirit and practice in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> circles strongly favour most delicate regard for the feelings and privacy of the poor. In fact, organizations usually make provision for exceptional cases by placing funds at the disposal of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or some officer of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, no account of which will be rendered even to the organization itself. No <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the names of those relieved or of the nature of their need is given even to any officer in the organization.

<p>The result of an inquiry into the condition of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, full account of the relief given, and all the salient facts in the condition and history of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or individual are made a matter of record in the minutes of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society's</a> meetings. These minutes are accessible to the members of the organization and to no one else unless definite necessity require it. The impression that records are a matter of indifference in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> circles is to some extent inexact. The card index method with its elaborate details is not used as widely as in other circles, but substantial records found in the minutes, supplemented by definite personal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, serve practically every purpose at which any matter of record-keeping can aim. Cases are thoroughly discussed in the regular meetings of the charitable <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Reports are made by those in charge and judgment in governing a case is based on thorough but confidential discussion. Every stage of relief-giving is made a matter of direct personal concern to a member of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, who looks upon his work as an organic part of his religious activity. This service of the poor is associated with the work of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> of an individual. The bond of spiritual union in charity, which results from this commonly shared estimate of its spiritual character, paves the way for a certain degree of co-ordination which adds greatly to the efficiency of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charities.

<p>We may take for illustration an average poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and study the process of relieving it. If housing conditions are bad, they are corrected, or a new house found. If the neighbourhood contains elements of moral danger, the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is moved to a new environment in another section of the city as a first step in its reconstruction. If housing conditions are satisfactory and the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is unable to pay rent, provision is made for it. The resources of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> are studied, and for members who are capable of wage-earning activity, employment is unfailingly found. This constitutes one of the most important and helpful features of relief work. If the mother is compelled to labour, provision is made for the care of her young children, as described below. If conditions do not warrant the mother in working, she is kept at home to care for her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and provision is made for her support. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> may be able to earn part but not all of the income needed, or it may need complete relief temporarily. Whatever the condition, effort is made to adjust the kind and degree of relief to the needs and outlook of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. At all times the primary aim is to draw out their resources, to do nothing which will stifle them, but to do everything which will lead the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in itself and effect its own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p>The standard of adequate relief cannot be a universally determined quantity. The judgment of those in immediate charge of the case is usually accepted as final, under the general policy of not doing too much nor quite all that may be needed. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is made to realize that self-help is in all cases better than relief from outside. The relief needed may be given in money to be expended by the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or in tickets on which are described the items and the quantities to be obtained. These tickets are presented to a selected retailer or to the storekeeper of the organization itself when the latter keeps standard supplies. We find many charitable associations which make a specialty of furnishing one particular kind of relief. Thus, for instance, one <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> may provide shoes and books for <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> children; another, outfits for newly-born infants or for First Communion children; another assumes the r&ocirc;le of Santa Claus and makes provision to answer the hopeful letters which the children of the poor write asking for <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> gifts. Certain organizations, like sewing circles, will meet regularly throughout the year or during a given period to make garments for later distribution. An interesting modification in relief work which is the outgrowth of the beautiful <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> sentiment is found in the practice of furnishing well-supplied baskets of provisions for <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> dinners. This practice is rapidly assuming large proportions, and appears to have a high <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> value. Many who appear indifferent to the needs of the poor are won over to an interest in them by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> giving, and numbers remain faithful contributors to charity work from that time on.

<p>If the resources of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> are temporarily suspended, a loan rather than formal charity may be needed, or <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> from the bondage of the loan shark. In such cases the required loan is found, the loan shark forcefully dealt with, or his claims taken and carried by the charitable <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The high sense of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> frequently found among the poor in repaying such loans or even money given in charity is worthy of mention. If the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> has need of legal assistance as may occur in cases of wife-desertion, non-support, cruelty, or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, the need is met by attorneys who are active members of a charitable organization, or by legal aid <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> made up of attorneys united for the purpose of giving legal aid to the poor. If the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> has sufficient income to meet its wants and its plight is due rather to mis-management than to need, efforts are made to give assistance in the management of things. Small <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> are gathered up into one sum, the time and manner of paying them are agreed upon and followed out, the purchase of necessaries is studied by the friendly visitor and the mother or father, with a view to intelligent economy and protection against <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>. The most intimate details in household management are regulated. If the father has carried insurance and is then unable to pay his dues, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> makes the payments. Such services make up the work of the friendly visitor. The aim is to bring to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> the services of a real and helpful friend rendered in a natural and friendly spirit, thus introducing into the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> circle the strength, intelligence, and moral support that come into normal lives through normal friendships. If the mother is a poor housekeeper, she is instructed; if she lacks intelligence in training her children, assistance is offered. There is no difficulty or defect in the whole economy of the home to which the friendly visitor will not direct attention in the hope of awakening the latent intelligence and resources of the little group.

<p>Though every poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> must be looked upon individually and should be relieved according to its individual constitution, the presence of large numbers of poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> subjected to practically the same environment and manifesting typical forms of weakness and inefficiency will present conditions which may be best dealt with collectively. The following are typical methods of collective relief: When a number of poor mothers are compelled to work, provision for the care of their young children is made in what is known as the day nursery. A central house is rented or purchased, where the mothers bring their children in the morning, and call for them after the day's work is done. The day nursery may be in charge of either religious or lay <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The children are taught, amused, fed, and clothed. The mothers are instructed as to the care of their children when occasion arises. In some cases a nominal charge of five or ten cents per day is made; in other cases there is no charge whatever. The policy is determined not from the standpoint of revenue but from that of sustaining the self-respect of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and hindering possible abuses of the generosity of the organization. A second form of collective service is found in what is known as the social settlement. The charitable <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> selects a house in a poor neighbourhood and makes it a centre of social activities for the poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> about it. Hither come mothers for their club meetings, instruction in sewing, housekeeping, and care of children; boys and girls, for their club meetings, play, or evening study. Old and young find an adequate <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> where the whole range of their approved tastes in reading may be satisfied. At such times and in such manner as suit conditions instruction is given in religion, the elements of character, and simpler trades; particular attention is directed to the work of teaching girls to make their own clothes. The social settlement furnishes for the poor as wide a range of opportunity for inspiration and self-development as the wealthy find in their clubs.

<p>Collective relief is found also in what is known as Fresh Air Work. A home is provided in the country to which the children of the poor are taken in relatively large numbers and remain from seven to fourteen days. A well-balanced diet is given to them during their stay, and their physical condition, moral, and spiritual needs are looked into. When the fresh air home is completely equipped, all physical defects are carefully noted and cases requiring attention are referred to charitable organizations for attention after the child's return home. These homes are under the direction of either religious or lay <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. A modification of this work is found in the single day excursions which are provided at frequent intervals during the summer for the children of the poor and for children in institutions. Another form of collective service is that of encouraging thrift. The typical method of doing this is to send collectors among the poor who gather their nickels and dimes which would otherwise be wasted, giving in return some form of receipt such as a stamp pasted into a book used for the purpose. The money thus collected is held to the credit of the saver and is returnable on demand. In this way, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> very frequently save sufficient during the summer to make provision for times of idleness or for the severer demands of the winter.

<p>The care of the sick poor in their homes is a matter of supreme concern. Aside from the service rendered by the friendly visitor whose function extends to all the members of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, whatever their condition, there are communities of sisters and associations of lay <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> which aim to nurse the sick and supply medicine, food, and clothing without remuneration of any kind. Physicians are found in fair numbers among our charitable organizations, and their services are uniformly given in the work. Religious communities thus engaged make no distinction as to creed or colour. The associations aim to supply definite needs of the sick poor. If a change of climate is required for an individual, the means and directions <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> are forthcoming; if tubercular patients require a special diet or delicate infants need a certified milk, provision is made; surgical appliances, artificial limbs, crutches, etc. are supplied whenever called for. Provision for the decent burial of the poor is found in practically all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charitable organizations; traditionally, the cemetery corporations furnish lots without expense. The <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> dispensary which is found widely among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> provides the services of physicians in special, as well as in general, practice for every type of ailment which may be brought to notice and furnishes medicines. All types of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, except those <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a>, perform every variety of service for the sick poor as conditions invite and circumstances permit. The activities of sisters in every form of relief work concurrently with those of lay organizations merit notice for their efficiency as well as their extent. Thus, for instance, a community of sisters engaged in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work will carry on systematically the work of giving relief to poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, friendly visiting, conducting sewing circles, instructing children, feeding destitute adults under certain conditions, finding employment, and making provision which the exigencies of illness may require.

<p>Hospitals furnish free wards for the poor whether adults or children. Convalescent Homes make provision for the sick poor who are necessarily dismissed from <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> before their final recovery from illness or operations. Separate homes are found for chronic and incurable cases such as those afflicted with cancer or tuberculosis. Homes for those temporarily out of employment, homes for working girls where food and lodging are obtained at a cost proportionate to income, homes for newsboys, shelters for homeless children, and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> where the children of the poor may learn trades, are also found. The lay charitable organizations include in their range of normal activities the visitation of inmates in such institutions and very frequently assistance of a most valuable kind is rendered. Visitors go to these institutions for the purpose of chatting with inmates and cheering the lonely monotony which tends to develop in spite of the best will and most careful management. Reading matter is brought and the homely comfort that may be found in a piece of fancy work or supply of chewing tobacco is not deemed unworthy of the visitor's attention. We find lay men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> constituting boards of directors to act in conjunction with the management of institutions and acting on auxiliary boards for the more remote but equally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> purpose of raising money or furthering the interests of the institutions with the public. For instance, ladies auxiliary work in conjunction with <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, Good Shepherd Homes, or <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, and raise money or provide linens of all kinds which are needed in the normal work of such institutions. The "linen shower" is a picturesque illustration of this method of work. Annual social events of one kind or another are inaugurated for the purposes of directing attention of the public toward institutions and to raise money for their general work. The tendency is marked to forget differences of creed in these larger events. One finds <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics working side by side in the spirit of a common purpose. Seminarians will at some time form organizations whose members devote one afternoon a week to the visiting of these institutions, doing the work of the friendly visitors or good samaritans in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> friendship.

<p>Various types of child life in our large cities present extremely distressing problems to the charitable <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Newsboys, half-orphans, friendless children, who are entirely neglected by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and wander away from home, are found in distressingly large numbers in our great cities. All such types are kept in mind and either lay or religious associations aim to discover them and to provide temporary or permanent homes for them. Usually those working in this manner act as employment agencies, and endeavour to find work for the children if they are of legal age, or to restore them to their homes and obtain for them the attention and provision to which they have a natural right. When a boy leaves an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> the authorities will find board and lodging without cost to him until he secures work. When work is found a representative of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> selects a safe boarding place for the boy, encourages him to save his money, and keeps in touch with him either personally or by correspondence as long as there is need.

<p>Homes for the aged under the care of sisters are numerous, though <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are, of course, often found in public poor-houses. The visitation of inmates of all such institutions is well-organized. Homes are found for friendless <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of good character and destitute mothers with infants, where protection may be had until employment is found or provision made for whatever relief the circumstances demand: Lodging and food are furnished for friendless and destitute men during periods of enforced idleness. This is done entirely without cost or possibly on the payment of a nominal charge of ten or fifteen cents per day. Lodging-houses in the large cities contain vast numbers of men of every kind and character. The danger in these places is more or less great because of their tendency to develop an atmosphere of vulgar abandon. In the largest cities <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charitable <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> provide halls and offer weekly entertainments exclusively to this type of friendless men. Volunteers are found who furnish musical or literary entertainment, and all are encouraged to sing. Lectures are given, usually by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on some moral or spiritual topic. Appeal is made gently but strongly to the better element of these homeless and friendless men, with the result that in large numbers they reform and return home or feel a renewal of spiritual vigour and helpfulness. Much temperance work is done among them, with results which are encouraging in the extreme.

<p>A notably large percentage of delinquents come from among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, hence the normal range of activity of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charitable organizations extends to those upon whom the hand of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has descended. The work of rescuing fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is notably well developed through the activity of religious. Little girls in danger of moral perversion are received by such homes where they have opportunity to learn a trade and arrive safely at maturity. Youthful offenders who come within the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Juvenile Court are committed to reformatories or industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> or placed on probation. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charitable <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> and individual <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are active in co-operating with the probation feature of the court. Sometimes an association pays the salary of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> probation officer who will be recognized by the court, or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in a position to do so offer their services as volunteer probation officers without compensation. The organization of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> thus engaged is now under way in the formation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Probation Leagues. This service is rendered by both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Associations provide truant officers whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is to follow up cases of truancy in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and report on them. The work of the big brother, in which an adult takes personal charge of a juvenile delinquent or of a poor boy and establishes informal friendly relations with him, is taking on hopeful proportions. The visiting of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> plays a considerable part in the life of nearly all important <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charitable <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. The visitors call in a friendly way, encourage the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> to take hopeful outlook, induce them to resume correspondence with their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and lead them to the promise of amended life which in many cases effects striking reforms. Reform <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and girls are regularly visited in the same manner.

<p>Practically all activity related to the care of defectives is concentrated in institutions. Provision for the deaf and dumb, blind, insane, epileptic, feeble-minded, and crippled is made by <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities to such an extent as resources permit. The interests of dependents, defectives, and delinquents of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> who are inmates of public institutions are provided for in a general way by the public policy found throughout the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. There are State Boards of Charity under whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in one way or another all such institutions fall. Much of the energy and resources of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charitable associations is taken up in the work of representing and protecting the interests of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inmates in public institutions. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are found in numbers among the members of such boards, or they appear before boards in the interests of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions with which the State deals, or of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inmates of public institutions.

<p>It is impractical to attempt to describe within the limits of this exposition the numbers of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> engaged in this work or to measure it in terms of money. Practically all of the activities described are carried on by men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who are busy at their daily occupations and who give their time, energy, and largely of their means to these <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, without compensation. One finds throughout this whole range of relief-giving the aim of spiritual strengthening and regenerating of the poor. This spiritual complement of modern relief is developed because of the conviction that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the foundation of character and the one source from which any correct attitude toward the mysteries of life may be found. Throughout the range of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charities one finds a spirit of tolerance for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and its failings and a comprehensiveness of sympathy which reaches low enough to think of homely comforts and high enough to accompany the victim of distress to the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for purposes of worship.
