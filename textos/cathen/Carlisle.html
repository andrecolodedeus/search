<h1>Carlisle</h1>  

<p>(CARLEOL, KARLIOLUM) &mdash; ANCIENT DIOCESE OF CARLISLE (CARLEOLENSIS, KARLIOLENSIS).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> was smaller in extent than the present <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> diocese, which was enlarged in 1856. The territory it originally included first became a political unit in the reign of William Rufus (1087-1100), who made it into the Earldom of Carlisle, including therein most, but not all, of the two counties of Cumberland and Westmoreland. In the reign of his successor, Henry I, the earldom was made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. Till that time it had formed part of the <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Diocese of Durham</a>, though there was a strong Celtic element that looked to Glasgow for episcopal administration. For the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the king secured the appointment of his former confessor, &AElig;thelwulf (1133-1155), an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Prior of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>, whom the king had established at Carlisle in 1102. At the time of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, however, &AElig;thelwulf seems to have been Prior of the Augustinian house at Nostell in Yorkshire. He ruled the diocese until his death in 1156, and from his charters it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was from the first well administered, and that there was a vigorous <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> life. &AElig;thelwulf built a moderate-sized Norman minster of which the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> and part of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> still exist, and to serve this <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> he introduced his own Augustinians, with the result that Carlisle was the only see in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with an Augustinian <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, the other monastic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters being <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>. Of the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Bernard, little is known, and after his death, in or about 1186, there was a long vacancy, during which the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered by another Bernard, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12633c.htm">Ragusa</a>. During this period Carlisle suffered severely from the incursions of the Scots, and early in Henry III's reign we find the king complaining to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that Carlisle had revolted to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and that the canons had elected a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for themselves. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Gualo, punished this action by exiling the canons and appointing Hugh, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Beaulieu, a good administrator, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It was important to the English Government to have a reliable <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> at Carlisle, as they constantly looked to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to attend to Scottish affairs, negotiate treaties, and generally play the part of diplomat. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Walter Malclerk, formerly agent of King John, and a prominent figure in the reign of Henry III. Always a patron of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>, he introduced both <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> into the city and diocese. He resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1246 in order to join the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>. About this time a new choir was begun and carried to completion, only to be destroyed in the great fire of 1292. A fresh beginning was made by energetic Bishop Halton (1292-1324), a favourite of Edward I, and for nearly a hundred years the building of the present choir proceeded, though with many interruptions. Its chief glory is the great east window, remarkable both for its own beauty and as marking a transition from the earlier style to the perfection of tracery. During this time the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was governed by a line of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, busy and useful diplomats in their day, but not remarkable in other respects. One of these was Thomas Merke, the intimate friend of Richard II, who was later on tried for high treason under Henry IV and deprived of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. The subsequent scholars, being frequently employed in negotiating truces and treaties with <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, while several of them were Chancellors of Oxford or of Cambridge. Among them was <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey's</a> friend, John Kite (1521-1537), who remained faithful to his master, and who supported him in the poverty of his latter days. The last of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was Owen Oglethorpe, the kindly-tempered <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who was prevailed on to crown Elizabeth when no other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> could be found to do that office for her &mdash; an act he so much regretted that, Antony &agrave; Wood says, the rest of his days "were both short and wearisome". He disobeyed the queen openly when she forbade him to elevate the Sacred Host in her presence; he refused to appear at a disputation on religion, or to take the Oath of Supremacy, was deprived of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> with the other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and died a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> 31 December, 1559. With him the history of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> see of Carlisle came to an end. It was a poor diocese, and when the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> plundered the churches they found little but a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> in each, and even of these some were of tin. There was only one archdeaconry, that of Carlisle. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, though this was changed at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>. The arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were: Argent, on a cross, sable, a <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> with labels, Or.
