<h1>Carlo Gozzi</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> author, born at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1720; died 1806. He spent in military service three years that ensued upon the completion of his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> studies. Then impelled by real necessity, since the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> means had been wasted away, he, like his brother Gasparo, directed his attention to <a href="../cathen/08245a.htm">literature</a>. He became a member of the Accademia dei Granelleschi, whose conservative feelings with regard to the native <a href="../cathen/08245a.htm">literary</a> traditions he shared, and ere long began an attack upon the dramatic methods of both of the leading playwrights of the time, Chiari and <a href="../cathen/06631a.htm">Goldoni</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and the bombast of the former had excited his ire, while the reform advocated by <a href="../cathen/06631a.htm">Goldoni</a> seemed to him undesirable, inasmuch as it involved the abolishment of the eminently <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <em>commedia dell' arte</em>. To illustrate his own views as to what was likely to be a popular form of the drama in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, he began the composition of his "Fiabe", for whose improbable plots he derived inspiration from various collections of fantastic tales, such as those contained in the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> "Cunto de li cunti" of Basile, the "Cabinet des f&eacute;es", and Oriental compilations. From Spanish plays of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries he also drew no little matter, and withal he freely used his own fancy and indulged lavishly his own satirical powers. There is little order, and hardly any subordination to rule in his "Fiabe", which, it should be said, differ from the <em>commedie dell' arte</em>, whose manner they were intended to continue, in that they are often written out in full and are not merely sketchy scenarii. They preserve the stock characters of the <em>commedie dell' arte</em>, such as Truffaldino, Brighella, and Pantalone, and make them speak in dialect, a fact which stood in the way of their diffusion outside of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> region; and they jumble together the heroic and the grotesque, the serious and the ridiculous, the real and the fantastic, bringing on the scene <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>, <a href="../cathen/10735a.htm">necromancers</a>, <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, fairies, monsters, and like figures. The high degree of popularity attained by the "Fiabe" in the author's time, and it was enough to enable him to drive <a href="../cathen/06631a.htm">Goldoni</a> from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, is explained by the presence in them of many elements of contemporaneous and topical interest. At home they later fell into oblivion in so far as theatrical repertories are concerned; for some time they continued to attract attention abroad, as is evinced by the consideration given to them by Goethe, by Schiller, who made a version of one of them, the "Turandot", by Schopenhauer, by Wagner, by Mme de Sta&euml;l, and others. As J. A. Symonds has said of them, and as Wagner seemed to apprehend, they have in them good material for operatic libretti. He prepared some plays based on Spanish dramas in opposition to the spread of the sentimental drama as represented by the <em>drame larmoyant</em> and <em>trag&eacute;die bourgeoise</em> of French origin. Among other works we have from him a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalrous</a> and romantic poem of satiric import, practically a mock-heroic, the "Marfisa bizzarra"; the almanac entitled "Tartana degl' Influssi", which has attacks on <a href="../cathen/06631a.htm">Goldoni</a> and Chiari; and the autobiographical "Memorie della sua vita". This last rather entertaining document was called forth by the strictures put upon him by a rival, Pietro Antonio Gratarol, whom he had previously forced from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> by the ridicule which he had brought upon him in a comedy, the "Droghe d'amore". The "Memorie" have been translated into English by J. A. Symonds (London, 1890). The "Fiabe" have been edited by E. Masi (Bologna, 1885), with a bibliography of all Gozzi's writings, while his other works may be found in the edition published at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1802.
