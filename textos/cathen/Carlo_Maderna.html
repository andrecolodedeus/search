<h1>Carlo Maderna</h1>  

<p>(1556-1629) known principally by his extension of St. Peter's, at the command of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, from the form of a Greek to that of a Latin cross. Regard for <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a> and other issues made the long <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> preferable, notwithstanding that the effect of the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> was thus much diminished. Maderna began his task in the year 1605, forty years after the death of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>. By bringing the columns nearer together, be sought to lessen the unfavorable effect produced, but in so doing obstructed the former unbroken vista in the side <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>. However, notwithstanding the extension, the great basilica has not lost its sublime grandeur.

<p>The new <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> was widened. It is an ornamental structure independent of the building itself, and its impressive size does not harmonize with the character of the decorations. The length measures 112 metres (367 ft. 4 in.) and the height 44 metres (144 ft. 4 in.). Eight gigantic columns, 27 metres (88 ft. 6 1/2 in.) in height, stand in two divisions, on both sides of which are pillars and embedded pillars. Above these extends an <a href="../cathen/05479b.htm">entablature</a> with balustrades, and an arch surmounts the portals. Upon this <a href="../cathen/05479b.htm">entablature</a> stand <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of Christ and the Apostles, 5 to 7 metres (16 to 22 ft.) high. Massive corner- pieces were intended for bell-towers, the lack of which at the present day weakens the effect of the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>. In the arrangement of the foreground and background, and in the different effects of intercolumniation much freedom is used not without many <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> shadow effects. Between the building, which was itself lengthened by 50 metres (164 ft.), and the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, there is a <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> 71 metres (nearly 233 ft.) wide, 13 metres (42 ft. 6 in.) deep, and 20 metres (65 ft. 6 in.) high, leading into the five entrances. The interior of this <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> is the finest work of the master, and it has even been rated one of the most beautiful <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> works of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on account of the lordly proportions, the symmetrical arrangement, and the simple colouring, the relief on the ceiling being <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in white and dark yellow.

<p>The two fountains in the open space (<em>piazza</em>) before St. Peter's are also much admired. The <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of St. Susanna and that of the Incurabili, as lesser works were better suited to the genius of Maderna. He also provided Sta. Francesca Romana with a <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> in the Baroque style. In all these works, the want of harmony between the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> and the main body of the church was an inheritance from the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. But it was partially through the influence of Fontana, his uncle, that Maderna was even then dominated by the freedom of the Baroque style, which, in its later development, broke loose from all restraint. The serious dignity of the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the Ges&ugrave; is not interfered with by its charming rhythm, varying shadow effects and rich decoration; and there is no lack of harmony of the whole, or of symmetry. The interior of Sant' Andrea della Valle, majestic and rich in tone gives us even now a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the artistic taste of Maderna. He built a part of the Palazzo Mattei (the court, with lofty loggias) and, with <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a>, the Palazzo Barberini (the central building, with three orders of columns and an open arcade). He co-operated, besides, in many works at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, for example, the Quirinal Gardens. At <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, he designed the fortifications.
