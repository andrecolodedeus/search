<h1>Carlo Maratta</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, 13 May, 1625, d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 15 December, 1713. From very early years Maratta showed an extraordinary skill in design, and was sent by his patrons to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to study under Andrea Sacchi, with whom he remained for many years, and for the rest of his life regarded as his greatest friend and benefactor. After a while he returned to his own part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and then in 1650, in company with the governor of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, Cardinal Albrizio, who had very much admired his talent, he came again to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was introduced to <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> who at once gave him many commissions and eventually, at the request of Sacchi, the important one for a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of Constantine destroying the idols for the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">Baptistery</a> of the Lateran. This was one of his greatest works, and increased his popularity at the Vatican. In 1704 he was knighted by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, and given the Order of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while in the same year he was created <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> in ordinary by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV of France</a>, who had seen his picture of Daphne and greatly admired it. It was during his residence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that Maratta was styled <em>Maratti</em> by the Romans, and his name is frequently written in that form, although originally it was as we have given it. The <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> was a member of the Academy of St. Luke in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was not only a skilful artist but extremely clever at cleaning and repairing frescoes, and was employed by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> to carry out such work as was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> frescoes in the Vatican. He was also a clever etcher, using the tool with much freedom and spirit.

<p>His pictures are very numerous. There are several in the Louvre and others in <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, St. Petersburg, and in the National Gallery, Hampton Court, and at Devonshire House in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. As a portrait <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> he takes high place. He was also a skilful architect, and responsible for the designs of several buildings. His religious pictures are marked by a certain strength and nobility, coupled with a gracious harmony. He was not so skilful in arranging drapery, and was a little, and was a little disposed to exaggerate the details and accessories, breaking in upon the general effect of his pictures, but this fault is less seen in his portraits than in his Madonna groups and religious compositions.
