<h1>Caroline Islands</h1>  

<p>A group of about 500 small coral islands, east of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, in the Pacific Ocean. The distance from <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a> to Yap, one of the larger islands of the group, is 1200 miles. The Caroline Islands were discovered in the sixteenth century by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and were so named in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, John Anthony Cantova and Victor Walter, attempted missionary work there in 1731; the former was soon <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>, the latter <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee. Two other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were killed later. In 1767 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were suppressed in the Spanish dominions, and during the next 120 years there is no trace of a missionary. The controversy between <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> concerning the possession of the Carolines having been settled by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> in favour of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the king directed <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> to the islands, 15 March, 1886, and the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> officially established that mission, 15 May, 1886, dividing it into two sections, named West and East Carolines respectively. Until then the islands had belonged ecclesiastically to the Vicariate Apostolic of Micronesia.

<p>The aborigines, of the Polynesian race, are not cannibals; they live mainly by hunting and fishing, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of agriculture, though the soil is very fertile. They wear very little clothing and build small huts of branches. Immorality is rife among them, even the little children being infected with it. The boys make progress in learning, the girls are exceptionally slow. The language spoken in commerce is English, but the aborigines have several dialects of their own. The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> had a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book printed in the Ponape dialect, and Father Anthony of Valentia wrote a small grammar and dictionary of the Yap dialect in 1890. They <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a Supreme Being (<em>Yalafar</em>) and in a bad spirit (<em>Can</em>), yet they have hardly any religious rites. When the Spanish Fathers had laid the foundations of the mission, these islands passed by purchase into the hands of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (1 June, 1899). <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> had contributed more than $5000 a year towards the mission; <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> granted no support. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> had compelled the aborigines to send their children to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> gave full liberty in this regard, and the somewhat lazy people consequently began to neglect <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> as well as church. The mission thereby suffered greatly, and the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> finally deemed it advisable to replace the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> with others of German nationality (7 Nov., 1904) and to erect one Apostolic prefecture instead of the two separate missions (18 Dec., 1905). The Very Reverend Father Venantius of Prechthal was appointed first <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>. In 1906 twelve fathers and twelve brothers were working in thirteen stations, and several Sisters of St. Francis left Luxemburg to take charge of the ten <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, in which were 262 children. Ninety adult converts were the harvest of that year, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is given as 1900 among 11,600 <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and a few <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Government sent, 1 July, 1905, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> from the observatory at <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a> to erect a meteorological station on the island of Yap, of which station the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Father Callistus was appointed director. The origin of the East-Asiatic typhoons had been traced to these regions, and twice a day observations are made, and notice is frequently given to Manila by cable.
