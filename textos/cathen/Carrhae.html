<h1>Carrhae</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of Mesopotamia. Carrhae is the Haran of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. It is frequently mentioned in Assyrian monuments under the name Harranu, which means "Road". It was the centre of the worship of the goddess Sin (the Moon), and was inhabited by Sabeans. Abraham came thither from Ur, in Chaldea (<a href="../bible/gen011.htm#vrs31">Genesis 11:31</a>), with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, which remained there (xxvii, 43) while he went on to <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaan</a> (xii, 1). Rebecca was born there (xxiv, 4), and Jacob lived there during fourteen years with his uncle <a href="../cathen/08717b.htm">Laban</a> (xxviii, 2; xxxi, 3). Under King Hezekiah it was taken by the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki019.htm#vrs12">2 Kings 19:12</a>; <a href="../bible/isa037.htm#vrs12">Isaiah 37:12</a>). Ezechiel (xxvii, 23) says it had commercial relations with Tyrus. In the neighbouring plain Crassus was defeated and killed by the Parthians (53 B.C.); Emperor Galerius was defeated on the same site (A.D. 296).

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> did not make rapid progress at Carrhae. <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>, before his expedition against the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, resided there in preference to <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> city; under Justinian most of its inhabitants were yet <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> (Procop. De bel. Pers., II, 13). In time, however, it became a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> in Osrhoene. <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a> (II, 973) mentions from the fourth to the sixth century eleven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; among them are: Vitus, the friend of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, St. Protogenes, and St. Abrahamius. The latter died at Constantinople. Emperor Theodosius II was so impressed by his saintly life that he chose to wear his poor tunic. From the sixth century the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> had at Carrhae a very flourishing Church; Patriarch Michael the Syrian enumerates seventeen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the eighth to the twelfth century (Revue de l'Orient chretien, 1901, p. 197). One <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is known, but not with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> (Eubel, I, 282). Carrhae was the residence of Merwan, the last of the Ommiad caliphs, and became the centre of a famous <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, where, in the tenth century, many Greek works were translated into Arabic. Harran, today a village in a wide, barren plain, destitute of trees, is not far from the river Belikh (Bilichus), and about 25 miles from Orfa (Edessa) in the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>. Its houses are shaped like sugar loaves and inhabited chiefly by bedouins. There are ruins of a Roman camp, of many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and of a fortress <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. Near the village is still to be found the well whence Rebecca was drawing water when Eliezer found her.
