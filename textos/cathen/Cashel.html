<h1>Cashel</h1>  

<p>A town in the County Tipperary, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, which is also a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The Rock of Cashel, to which the town below owes its origin, is an isolated elevation of stratified limestone, rising abruptly from a broad and fertile plain, called the Golden Vein. The top of this eminence is <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by a group of remarkable ruins. This ancient <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> has lost its importance and most of its inhabitants. The population is less than 3000. Originally known as Fairy Hill, or <em>Sid-Druim,</em> the "Rock" was, in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> times, the dun or castle of the ancient Eoghnacht Chiefs of Munster. In Gaelic <em>Caiseal</em> denotes a circular stone fort and is the name of other places in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The "Book of Rights" suggests that the name is derived from <em>Cais-il,</em> i.e. "tribute stone", because the Munster tribes paid tribute on the Rock. Here, Corc, the grandfather of Aengus Mac Natfraich, erected a fort, and Cashel subsequently became the capital of Munster. Like Tara and Armagh it was a celebrated court, and at the time of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> claimed supremacy over all the royal duns of the province, when Aengus ruled as King of Cashel. About 450, <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick preached</a> at the royal dun and converted Aengus. The "Tripartite Life" of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> relates that while "he was baptising Aengus the spike of the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crozier</a> went through the foot of the King" who bore with the painful wound in the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> "that it was a rite of the Faith". And, according to the same authority, twenty-seven kings of the race of Aengus and his brother Aillil ruled in Cashel until 897, when Cerm-gecan was slain in battle. There is no evidence that <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> founded a church at Cashel, or appointed a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cashel. <a href="../cathen/01234b.htm">St. Ailbe</a>, it is supposed, had already fixed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at Emly, not far off, and within the king's dominions. Cashel continued to be the chief residence of the Kings of Munster until 1100. Hence its title, "City of the Kings". Before that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> there is no mention in the native annals of any Bishop, or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cashel. Cormac MacCullinan is referred to, but not correctly, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cashel, by later writers. He was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but not of Cashel, where he was king. The most famous man in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> of his time, but more of a scholar and warrior than an ecclesiastic, Cormac has left us a glossary of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> names, which displays his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and the "Psalter of Cashel", a work treating of the history and antiquities of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He was slain in 903, in a great battle near Carlow.

<p>Brian Boru fortified Cashel in 990. Murtagh O'Brien, King of Cashel, in presence of the chiefs and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, made a grant in 1101 of the "Rock" with the territory around it to O'Dunan, "noble bishop and chief senior of Munster", and dedicated it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. Then Cashel became an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, and O'Dunan its first <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> as far as the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, St. Celsus, could appoint him. At the synod of Kells, 1152, Cardinal Paparo gave a <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to Donat O'Lonergan of Cashel, and since then his successors have ruled the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Munster. In 1127 Cormac MacCarthy, King of Desmond, erected close to his palace on the "Rock" a church, now known as Cormac's Chapel, which was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1134, when a synod was held within its walls. During the episcopate of Donal O'Hullican (1158-82), the King of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, Donal O'Brien, built in 1169 a more spacious church beside Cormac's Chapel, which then became a chapterhouse.

<p>The "City of Kings" had a full share in the vicissitudes of the times. Maurice, a Geraldine, filled the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from 1504 to 1523, and was succeeded by a natural son of Pierce, Earl of Ormond, Edmund Butler, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Athassal Abbey. In addition to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> between the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and the English there now arose a new element of discord, the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> introduced by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> shared in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> failings, propensity for plundering and servility to the king. While residing at Kilmeaden Castle he levied black-mail on the traders of the Suir, robbing their boats and holding their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for ransom. At a session of the privy council held at Clonmel, 1539, he <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to uphold the spiritual supremacy of the king and denied the power in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>. It does not appear that he left the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He died 1550 and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Roland, a Geraldine (1553-61), was created <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>. After a vacancy of six years Maurice FitzGibbon (1567-78) a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and James MacCaghwell was put forward by Elizabeth. Thus began the new religion at Cashel. FitzGibbon, who belonged to the Desmond <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, being deprived of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> fled to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and passed into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> where he resided for a time at the Court. He conferred with the English ambassador at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in order to obtain pardon for leaving the country without the Queen's sanction, and to get permission to return. In this he failed, and going back to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> secretly he was arrested and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, where he died (1578) after much suffering. On the death of MacCaghwell, Elizabeth advanced Miler MacGrath, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Down, to the See of Cashel. He held at the same time four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and several <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, out of which he provided for his numerous offspring. Having occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> fifty-two years and wasted its temporalities, he died in 1622. His monument in the ruined <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> bears a strange epitaph written by himself.

<p><a href="../cathen/11228b.htm">Dermod O'Hurley</a> of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, a distinguished student of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and professor at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, was appointed (1581) by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>. Having laboured secretly for two years among his flock, he was discovered and brought before the Lord Justices at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. He suffered cruel tortures rather than take the Oath of Supremacy. He was hanged outside the city (1583). The story of the See of Cashel varies little for more than two centuries following; it is a narrative of struggle and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for the old Faith. The roll of its <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> presents men illustrious by learning, wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, as in former days. Meanwhile, on "the Rock" the monuments to the Faith and art of a noble period were yielding to the spoiler and falling to decay. Dr. James Butler 2nd (1774-91), on being appointed settled in Thurles, where the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> have since resided. His successor, Archbishop Bray (1792-1820), built a large church in the early part of the nineteenth century, on the site of which Archbishop Leahy (1857-74) erected a splendid <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in Romanesque style. It was completed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1879 by <a href="../cathen/04514b.htm">Archbishop Croke</a> (1874-1902), and dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption. <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a> (feast 8 Jan.), a reputed former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, is the patron of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cashel is Administrator of the ancient Diocese of Emly.
