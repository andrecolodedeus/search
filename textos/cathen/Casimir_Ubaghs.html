<h1>Casimir Ubaghs</h1>  

<p>Born at Berg&eacute;lez-Fauquemont, 26 November, 1800; died at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, 15 February, 1875, was for a quarter of a century the chief protagonist of the Ontologico-Traditionalist School of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. In 1830, while professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the lower <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Rolduc, he was called to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, which under his influence became a centre of <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologism</a>. In 1846 he undertook the editorship of the "Revue catholique", the official organ of <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologism</a>, in conjunction with Arnold Tits, who had taught with him at <a href="../cathen/13118c.htm">Rolduc</a> and joined him at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1840, and Lonay, professor at <a href="../cathen/13118c.htm">Rolduc</a>. La For&ecirc;t, Claessens, the <a href="../cathen/02715b.htm">Abb&eacute; Bouquillon</a>, P&egrave;re Bernard Van Loo, and others followed the doctrines of Ubaghs. But opponents soon appeared. The "Journal historique et litt&eacute;raire", founded by Kersten, kept up an incessant controversy with the "Revue catholique". Kersten was joined by Gilson, dean of Bouillon, Lupus, and others. From 1858 to 1861 the controversy raged. It was at its height when a decision of the Roman Congregation (21 Sept., 1864) censured in Ubaghs's works, after a long and prudent deliberation, a series of propositions relating to <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologism</a>. Already in 1843 the Congregation of the Index had taken note of five propositions and ordered M. Ubaghs to correct them and expunge them from his teaching, but he misunderstood the import of this first decision. When his career was ended in 1864 he had the <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> of witnessing the ruin of a teaching to which he had devoted forty years of his life. From 1864 until his death he lived in retirement.

<p>The theories of Ubaghs are contained in a vast collection of treatises on which he expended the best years of his life. Editions followed one another as the range of his teaching widened. The fundamental thesis of <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a> is clearly affirmed by Ubaghs, the acquisition of metaphysical and moral <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> is inexplicable without a primitive Divine teaching and its oral transmission. Social teaching is a <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, a condition so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that without a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> man could not save through it attain the explicit <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of a metaphysical and a moral order. Teaching and language are not merely a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> medium which favours the acquisition of these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>; its action is determinant. Hence the primordial act of man is an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; the authority of others becomes the basis of certitude. The question arises: Is our adhesion to the fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the speculative and moral order blind; and, is the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, which is one of them, impossible of rational demonstration? Ubaghs did not go as far as this; his <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a> was mitigated, a semi-Traditionalism; once teaching has awakened <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> in us and transmitted the maxims (<em>ordo acquisitionis</em>) reason is able and apt to comprehend them. Though powerless to discover them it is regarded as being capable of demonstrating them once they have been made known to it. One of his favourite camparisons admirably states the problem: "As the word 'view' chiefly expresses four things, the faculty of seeing, the act of seeing, the object seen, e.g. a landscape, and the drawing an artist makes of this object, so we give the name <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, which is derived from the former, chiefly to four different things: the faculty of knowing rationally, the act of rational <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the object of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> copy or formula which we make of this object in conceiving it" (Psychologie, 5th ed., 1857, 41-42). Now, the objective <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, or object-idea (third acceptation), in other words, the intelligible which we contemplate, and contact with which produces within us the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> formula (notion), is "something Divine" or rather it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself. This is the core of <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologism</a>. The intelligence contemplates <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> directly and beholds in Him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> or "objective <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>" of which our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a weak reflection. Assuredly, if Ubaghs is right, skepticism is definitively overcome. Likewise if teaching plays in the physical life the part he assigns to it, the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of every <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which asserts the original independence of reason and which Ubaghs calls <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>. But this so-called triumph was purchased at the cost of many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. It is, to say the least, strange that on the one hand <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologistic</a> <a href="../cathen/15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a> is based on a distrust of reason and on the other hand it endows reason with unjustifiable prerogatives. Surely it is an incredible audacity to set man face to face with the Divine essence and to attribute to his weak mind the immediate perception of the eternal and immutable verities.

<p>Ubaghs's principal works are: <ul><li>"Logicae seu philosophiae rationalis elementa" (6 editions, 1834-60); <li>"Ontologiae sive metaph. generalis specimen" (5 editions, 1835-63); <li>"Theodicae seu theologiae naturalis" (4 editions); <li>"Anthropoligicae philosoph. elementa" (1848); <li>"Pr&eacute;cis de logique &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire" (5 editions); <li>"Pr&eacute;cis d'anthropol. psychologique" (5 editions); <li>"Du r&eacute;alisme en th&eacute;ologie et en philosophie" (1856); <li>"Essai d'id&eacute;ologie ontologique" (1860); <li>numerous articles in the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> "Revue catholique".</ul>
