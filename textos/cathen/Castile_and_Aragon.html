<h1>Castile and Aragon</h1>  

<p>The united kingdom which came into existence by the marriage (1469) of <a href="../cathen/08177a.htm">Isabella</a>, heiress of Castile, with Ferdinand the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, King of Aragon. <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> made his voyages of discovery as the agent of the "Catholic Kings" (<em>los Reyes Cat&oacute;licos</em>) of this united kingdom, which in the course of history became the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Kingdom of Spain</a> &mdash; or, more precisely, of the Spains.
<h2>Castile</h2>

<p>The origin of the name Castile is a matter of dispute, but it is more than probably derived from the fortified castles (<em>castillos</em>), built first by the Romans to protect themselves from the Cantabrians whom they had not completely subjugated, and afterwards by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to defend the northern regions which they had conquered from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. At the present time this name is given to the extensive region which forms the central portion of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and is bounded on the north by the Bay of Biscay (the ancient <em>Sinus Cantabricus</em>), on the east by the Basque Provinces, and the provinces of <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, Aragon, and Valencia, on the south by Andalusia, and on the west by Estremadura, <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, and the Asturias, and is divided into Old Castile and New Castile.
<h3>Old Castile (Castilla la Vieja)</h3>

<p>It is asserted by some (Fern&aacute;ndez Guerra, Cantabria) that Old Castile was called <em>Vellegia</em> and afterwards <em>V&eacute;tula</em>, that it was called <em>Vieja,</em> or <em>Antiqua,</em> to distinguish it from <em>Castilla la Nueva</em> &mdash; the New Castile formed from the lands which since the eleventh century had been reconquered beyond the mountain chain of the Carpetano-Vet&oacute;nica. Old Castile is in outline an irregular triangle, the western frontier bordering on the ancient Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, the south-eastern boundary being the Sierras de Gredos, Guadarrama, and the Moncayo (<em>Mons Caunus</em>), and the north-eastern, the river Ebro. In the political division of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the ancient province of Cantabria, which is included in Castile, does not belong to it either ethnographically or geographically, but forms a separate district called by those who inhabit it <em>de Pe&ntilde;as al Mar,</em> or more commonly <em>La Monta&ntilde;a</em>. In the present political division Old Castile comprises a territory of 22,415 square miles, with a population of 1,654,585, and since the division of 1833 it has included the eight provinces of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, Soria, Logro&ntilde;o, and <a href="../cathen/13458d.htm">Santander</a>. Old Castile forms the highest plateau of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, perhaps of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the mean height being 880 feet. The mountain streams of this region feed the river Ebro in the north-east, the Duero, which flows through the centre, and the Pisuerga, which is a tributary of the Duero. Owing to its situation it has the most extreme climate of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, both as to cold and heat, and its fertile soil produces wheat and other cereals. The most important cities are: <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, population 29,683, famous for its Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which is one of the most beautiful in the world; Valladolid, population 52,181, which was the capital of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> until the time of Philip II; Santander, population 41,021, capital of Cantabria, a maritime city with an extensive commerce; Segovia, population 11,318, where the ancient Alcazar and the artillery <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> are situated; and Avila, population 25,039, the city of St. Teresa.
<h3>New Castile</h3>

<p>As has already been said, this name was given to the territory reconquered from the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, from the time of Alfonso VI to that of St. Ferdinand. This region also forms a great table-land, not quite so lofty as that of Old Castile, and is bounded on the north by the mountain chain of the Carpetano-Vet&oacute;nica, on the south by the Sierra Morena, on the east by the mountains of Cuenca; the mountains of Toledo, which merge into the Sierra de Guadalupe in Estremadura, run through the centre and separate the two great valleys into which New Castile is divided, that of the Tagus to the north, and that of the Guadiana to the south. The river Jucar, which flows through the south-east, rises in the mountains of Cuenca. The climate is not so cold as that of Old Castile, and the soil not so fertile, there being a scarcity of water, especially in La Mancha. Its present limits comprise an area of 28,017 square miles, with a population of 1,777,506, and is divided into the five provinces of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, Toledo, <a href="../cathen/03793d.htm">Ciudad Real</a>, Cuenca, and <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>. The principal cities are: <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, population 518,442, the capital of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> since the time of Philip II, noted for its royal palace, picture gallery, containing specimens of <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velasquez</a>, <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillo</a>, etc., and armoury (Museo de la Real Armer&#237;a); Toledo, population 26,239, ancient capital of the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by Charles I with the title of "Imperial", and noted for its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, one of the finest monuments of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, as well as for its military <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>, which has a military <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for engineers; Aranjuez, where one of the favourite country residences of the Spanish royal family is situated; and Alcal&aacute;, the seat of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> founded by Cisneros, which has since been transferred to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>, near <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, contains the famous mausoleum of Philip II, and is one of the historic monuments of New Castile.
<h3>History</h3>

<p>(1) <em>The Countship (Condado) of Castile</em>



<p>The territory of Old Castile began to be reconquered in the time of the first three Alfonsos, who entrusted to several counts the repopulation and defence of these cities; thus Ordo&ntilde;o I entrusted the repopulation of Amaya, on the Pisuerga, to Rodrigo, a Goth by extraction, and his son, Diego Porcellos, fortified and repopulated <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> under the orders of Alfonso III. Nu&ntilde;o N&uacute;&ntilde;ez de Roa, Gonzalo T&eacute;llez de Osma, and Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;les de Sep&uacute;lveda appear also in the same r&ocirc;le. In 910 a Count of Castile, Nu&ntilde;o Fern&aacute;ndez, assisted the sons of Alfonso III in their rebellion against their father, and Ordo&ntilde;o II of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a> (924) was defeated by the troops of Abd&eacute;rraman in Valdejunquera because the Counts of Castile did not come to his assistance; in punishment of their disloyalty, Ordo&ntilde;o had them <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and executed in <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>. Tradition hands down the names of these counts as Nu&ntilde;o Fern&aacute;ndez, Abolmondar el Blanco, his son Diego, and Fernando Ans&uacute;rez. Further on mention is made of the judges of Castile, Lain Calvo and Nu&ntilde;o Rasura, established to facilitate the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but who fostered the spirit of independence. The hero of this movement was Count Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez, to whom legendary lore has attributed all manner of heroic achievements. It is, however, known that, after having fought with Ramiro II against the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, and after the battle of Simancas and the retreat of Abd&eacute;rraman, this count, dissatisfied, as it appears, because the King of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a> distributed his troops in the frontier towns, rose in rebellion against him. He was, however, vanquished and made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. He became reconciled with his sovereign, giving his daughter Urraca in marriage to the king's son, Ordo&ntilde;o, who afterwards became Ordo&ntilde;o III. Notwithstanding this alliance, Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez* continued to foment trouble and discord in <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, aiming to secure his independence. He successively aided Sancho against his brother, Ordo&ntilde;o III, and Ordo&ntilde;o, son of Alfonso IV (the Monk), against Sancho the Fat (<em>el Graso</em>). After the death of Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez* (970) there followed the campaigns of Alm&aacute;nzor, in which all the reconquered territory was at stake. In 995 the King of Navarre and Garc&#237;a Fern&aacute;ndez, the son of Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez, made an attempt to oppose him, but were defeated at Alcocer. Sancho Garcia, grandson of Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez, took part in the victory of Calata&ntilde;azor, which put an end to the campaigns of the victorious <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> <em>h&aacute;jib</em> (1002). This Count Sancho Garc&#237;a was called <em>El de los Fueros</em> (literally, "He of the Rights" or "of the Charters"), because of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> or charters which he granted to the various cities. His son, Garc&#237;a S&aacute;nchez, gave one of his sisters, Elvira, in marriage to Sancho the Great of Navarre, and another, Jimena, to Bermudo III of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, and was himself about to marry Sancha, Bermudo's sister, when he was assassinated by the Velas, Counts of Alava. At his death Sancho of Navarre reclaimed the countship of Castile, and took possession of it, notwithstanding the resistance of Bermudo III.

<p>(2) <em>The Kingdom of Castile</em>

<p>Sancho the Great divided his possessions among his sons. Castile, with the title of king, was given to Ferdinand, who had married Sancha, the sister of Bermudo, who was to have married Garc&#237;a S&aacute;nchez, the last independent count. Ferdinand I, of Castile, united Castile and Leon, the latter having fallen to his wife upon the death of her brother, Bermudo III. Thus reinforced, Ferdinand extended his conquests as far as Coimbra; but he committed the fatal <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of dividing his possessions among his three sons and two daughters. Sancho, who inherited the Kingdom of Castile, began encroaching upon the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his brothers, but was assassinated at the siege of Zamora, which he was trying to take from his sister Urraca, and was succeeded by Alfonso VI. This monarch began to reunite the estates of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and carried the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of reconquest beyond the mountain chain of the Carpentano-Vet&oacute;nica, capturing <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> and Toledo, and thus laying the foundations of New Castile. He gave his daughter Teresa in marriage to Henry of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, forming for them, with the western territory reconquered from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, the Countship of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, which was the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> monarchy. His daughter Urraca succeeded him, the first queen to reign in the kingdom where <a href="../cathen/08177a.htm">Isabella the Catholic</a> was later to hold the sceptre. Alfonso VII bore the title of emperor, and extended his conquests as far as Almeria, but he, also, at his death in 1157, divided his possessions among his children, giving Leon to Ferdinand II, and Castile to Sancho, in whose short reign the <a href="../cathen/01271b.htm">Military Order of Alc&aacute;ntara</a> was founded. Alfonso VIII (1158-1214) conquered Cuenca and defeated the Almohades in the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212), which definitively freed New Castile from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> yoke. This decisive victory is annually commemorated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> on the 16th of July, under the title "El Triumfo de la Santa Cruz" (The Triumph of the Holy Cross). After the brief reigns of Henry I and Do&ntilde;a Berengaria, Castile and Leon were definitively united under <a href="../cathen/06042a.htm">St. Ferdinand III</a> (1219-52), who conquered the greater part of <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a> (Jaen, <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, and Seville, 1248), leaving the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> only the <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Kingdom of Granada</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> occupies the first place among the monuments of his greatness. His successors failed to carry on the reconquest. Alfonso X, "The Wise" (<em>el Sabio</em>), was too much taken up with his vain pretensions to the imperial crown of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Sancho the Brave (1248-95) and Ferdinand IV, "The Cited" (<em>el Emplazado</em>), with their domestic struggles. In the time of Sancho IV the celebrated defence of Tarifa took place, giving to Alonzo P&eacute;rez de Guzm&aacute;n, to whom it was entrusted, the title of "The Good" (<em>el Bueno</em>). Alfonso XI (1310-50) in the battle of Salado annihilated the last of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> who attempted the reconquest of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The irregularity of his private life, however, paved the way for the disorders and cruelties of the reign of his son Pedro, the Cruel, who met death at the hands of his bastard brother, Henry II (1369-79). Bertrand du Guesclin, with his famous companies, was the ally of Henry II. John I attempted to obtain possession of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, but was defeated by the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> at Aljubarrota (1385), and his grandson, John II, turned over the government to his favourite, Alvaro de Luna, whom he afterwards caused to be decapitated (1453). Henry IV, "The Impotent", was the tool of the nobles, who forced him to declare <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> his daughter Juana, known as <em>la Beltraneja</em> (the daughter of Beltran), and the succession thus passed to his sister <a href="../cathen/08177a.htm">Isabella the Catholic</a> (1474).
<h2>Aragon</h2>

<p>Aragon derives its name from the river Aragon, a small tributary of the Ebro near Alfaro, and forms an irregular ellipse, bounded on the north by the Central Pyrenees (Pic du Midi), on the east by Catalonia and Valencia (Provinces of L&eacute;rida, <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, and Castellon), on the south by Valencia and New Castile (Provinces of Valencia and Cuenca), and on the west by Navarre and Castile (Provinces of <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a> and Soria). It is one of the most mountainous regions of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, perhaps of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, surrounded as it is on the north by the Pyrenees mountains and the Sierras de la Pe&ntilde;a and de Guara, on the west by the Moncayo and the mountains of Cuenca, and on the south by the Montes Universales and the Sierra de G&uacute;dar. From north-west to south-east it is traversed by the River Ebro, of which almost all the rivers of this region are tributaries, the Aragon, Gallego, and Cinca emptying into it from the north, and the Jiloca, the Jalon, and others of lesser importance from the south. The Guadalaviar and the Mijares, however, are fed directly from the mountains of <a href="../cathen/14525a.htm">Teruel</a>. These topographical conditions made the soil of Aragon very fertile; the mountains are covered with great forests, and fruits grow abundantly, but, on account of the isolation of the mountains and the scarcity of water on some of the high table-lands, some regions are but thinly populated. According to the modern division of provinces (30 Nov., 1833), <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>, and Teruel belong to Aragon. The principal cities are Saragossa, famous for its sieges in the War of Independence and for the ancient shrine <em>del Pilar,</em> where from very remote times the Blessed Virgin has been <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, and Huesca (Osca), where Pedro IV established, in 1354, a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to which was given the name of the Sertorio, in memory of Quintus Sertorius, who, in 77 <font size=-2>B. C., </font> founded here a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the sons of native chiefs.
<h3>History</h3>

<p>We must depend principally on legend for information about the origin of the Aragonese monarchy. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that a portion of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> driven northward by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> invasion sought refuge among the mountaineers, who were never completely subjugated by any conqueror (<em>indoctus juga ferre</em> &mdash; Horace), and there formed certain independent countships, principally those of Sobrarbe, Aragon, and Ribagorza. The legend designates the Montes Uruel or S. Juan de la Pe&ntilde;a as the spot where the patriots assembled, and from a cross which appeared over a tree the name, Sobrarbe, and the <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> were derived, just as Aragon took its name from the river which flows west of <a href="../cathen/08260a.htm">Jaca</a>, which appears to have been its capital. About 724 mention is made of a Garc&#237;a Jim&eacute;nez who was Count of Sobrarbe, and further on we find that Garc&#237;a I&ntilde;iguez bestowed the Countship of Aragon upon a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> named Azmar, who had obtained possession of <a href="../cathen/08260a.htm">Jaca</a>. This countship then embraced the valleys of Canfranc, Aisa, Borao, Arag&uuml;es, and Hecho. After Azmar (d. 975) we find the names of several counts of Aragon &mdash; Galindo, Jimeno Aznar, Jimeno Garc&#237;a Aznar, Fortunio Jim&eacute;nez, and Urraca, or Andregoto, who married Garc&#237;a of Navarre, thus uniting Navarre and Aragon. The Countship of Ribagorza, established under the protection of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, was reconquered by Sancho the Great of Navarre, who at his death left Aragon to his son Ramiro, and Sobrarbe and Ribagorza to his son Gonzalo (1035), but at Gonzalo's death Ramiro was elected to succeed him, the Aragonese monarchy being definitively founded. Sancho Ram&#237;rez (1069-94) took a great part of the deep valley of the Cinca from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, with the strongholds of <a href="../cathen/02285b.htm">Barbastro</a> and Monzon, and died while besieging Huesca. His son Pedro I, after vanquishing the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> auxiliary army in the battle of Alcoraz, took possession of the city. His brother, Alfonso the Fighter (<em>El Batallador,</em> 1104-34), who succeeded him, captured Saragossa (1118), but died from the effects of wounds received in the siege of Fraga, willing his estates to the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, thinking that they would be best able to bring the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of reconquest to a successful close. His subjects, however, would not accept this, and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> his brother Ramiro, who was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint-Pons de Tomi&#232;res, to accept the crown. Dispensed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, he married Agnes of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, and when the birth of a daughter, whom he married to Raymond Berengar IV, Count of Barcelona, assured the succession, he returned to his <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. Thus a permanent union was effected between Aragon and Catalonia. Raymond Berengar reconquered Fraga, and his son Alfonso II finished the reconquest of Aragon, adding Teruel. Pedro II, "The Catholic" (<em>El Cat&oacute;lico,</em> 1196-1213), made his kingdom a dependency of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, although not with the consent of his subjects, but died in the battle of Muret, in which he took part to aid his kinsman, the Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. Jaime the Conqueror (<em>El Conquistador</em>) successfully terminated the conquest of Valencia (1238) and Majorca (1228), and aided Alfonso X of Castile to reconquer Murcia, thus accomplishing the reconquest of the western part of the Peninsula. Pedro III, "The Great" (<em>El Grande,</em> 1276-85), after the <a href="../cathen/15384a.htm">Sicilian Vespers</a> took possession of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> as heir of the Hohenstaufen, and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and disputes which followed in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the dissensions of the Aragonese nobles occupied the reigns of Alfonso III (1285-91), Jaime II, Alfonso IV (1327-36), and Pedro IV (1336-87). John I and Martin (1395-1410) dying without heirs, the <em>Conpromiso de Caspe</em> (a commission of nine members, three from the Cortes of each province) was assembled and gave the crown of Aragon to Ferdinand of Antequera, Infante of Castile. Alfonso V, his son and successor, renewed the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. As the adopted son of Joanna of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, he laid claim to the throne of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and obtained possession of it (1416-58). John II disturbed the peace of his reign by the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of his son the Prince of Viana, and at his death was succeeded by Ferdinand the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, who by his marriage to <a href="../cathen/08177a.htm">Isabella the Catholic</a> definitively united the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon.
<h2>Relations between Castile and Aragon</h2>

<p>The will of Sancho the Great of Navarre had in 1035 separated these two kingdoms; in the twelfth century they were temporarily united by the marriage of Do&ntilde;a Urraca to Alfonso I, "The Fighter", but this unhappy marriage caused a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which ended in the separation of the couple (1114), and Alfonso VII was afterwards <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recover the strongholds of La Rioja, which had remained in the possession of the Aragonese monarch (1134). At the death of Alfonso I of Aragon Alfonso VII reclaimed and occupied part of his estates, but Alfonso II aided by Alfonso VIII in the siege of Cuenca (1177) obtained for his kingdom freedom from the dependence on Castile, to which it had been subjected since the time of Ramiro the Monk. The two great warriors, <a href="../cathen/06042a.htm">St. Ferdinand III</a> and Jaime <em>el Conquistador,</em> were contemporaries and lived in harmony. Jaime helped Alfonso X in the conquest of Murcia, which remained to Castile. Later, however, the relations between Castile and Aragon again became involved, on account of the claims for the succession to Alfonso X, which the Infantes of la Cerda, aided by Philip III of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Alfonso III of Aragon, put forth. The <em>Compromiso de Caspe</em> placed the crown of Aragon on the head of an Infante of Castile, Ferdinand of Antequera (1412), and the marriage of Isabella, heiress of Henry IV of Castile, to Ferdinand, the heir of John II of Aragon, finally united these kingdoms and formed the beginning of the Spanish monarchy.

<p>The linguistic unity of Castile and Aragon is a very notable fact because although Aragon and Catalonia, united since the twelfth century (1137), possess two very different languages, Castile and Aragon, although they had an entirely independent historical development until the sixteenth century, have the same language with the exception of some minor <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> differences. After the union the political individuality of Aragon was lost in that of Castile, and in the time of Philip II, on account of the Antonio P&eacute;rez incident, the ancient kingdom lost part of its <em>fueros,</em> or political liberties. In the War of Succession it sided with the Archduke Charles, and the victory of Philip V served still more to increase its dependence.
<h2>Civil and ecclesiastical divisions</h2>

<p>It is difficult, on account of the different epochs in which they were formed and the different principles which governed them, to give an exact <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the relations between the civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> divisions of Castile and Aragon.
<h3>Judiciary</h3>

<p>The <em>Judiciary Divisions</em> consist of the five district courts of (1) <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, (2) Valladolid, (3) <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, (4) Albacete-Murcia, and (5) Saragossa, which are subdivided as follows: (1) Provinces of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, <a href="../cathen/13458d.htm">Santander</a>, Logro&ntilde;o, and Soria; (2) Valladolid and Palencia; (3) <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>, <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, and Toledo; (4) Ciudad Real and Cuenca; (5) Saragossa, <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14525a.htm">Teruel</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> district comprises thirty-seven Courts of First Instance and as many Property Registries; that of Valladolid, seventeen of each; that of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, forty-nine Courts of First Instance and forty-two Property Registries; Albacete-Murcia, eighteen Courts of First Instance and the same number of Property Registries; Saragossa, twenty-one Courts of First Instance and thirty Property Registries.
<h3>Military</h3>

<p><em>For Military Purposes</em> there are four districts, subdivided into sixteen provinces, as follows: Old Castile, subdivided into the provinces of <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, and Valladolid; <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, with the provinces of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, Logro&ntilde;o, Soria, and Santander; New Castile, with the provinces of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, Toledo, Cuenca, <a href="../cathen/03793d.htm">Ciudad Real</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>; Aragon, with Saragossa, <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14525a.htm">Teruel</a>.

<p><em>Education</em>

<p>For <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and secondary instruction the four districts are: Old Castile, with the <a href="../cathen/15259a.htm">University of Valladolid</a> and four centres of secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, and Santander; New Castile, with the University of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, and centres of secondary instruction at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> (S. Isidro and Cisneros), <a href="../cathen/03793d.htm">Ciudad Real</a>, <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>, <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, Toledo, and Cuenca; Aragon, with the <a href="../cathen/13470a.htm">University of Saragossa</a>, and centres of secondary instruction at <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>, <a href="../cathen/14525a.htm">Teruel</a>, Logro&ntilde;o, and Soria; Leon, with the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a> and a centre of secondary instruction at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>. Primary instruction is under the care of one first-class <em>inspeccion</em> at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, the four second-class <em>inspecciones</em> of Valladolid, <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, Toledo, and Saragosso, and the eleven third-class <em>inspecciones</em> of <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, <a href="../cathen/03793d.htm">Ciudad Real</a>, Cuenca, Logro&ntilde;o, <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>, <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13458d.htm">Santander</a>, <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, Soria, <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14525a.htm">Teruel</a>.
<h3>Ecclesiastical</h3>

<p>This is in many respects not in conformity with the civil, and still subject to the changes made by the Concordat of 1851, which suppressed some sees and transferred others. In Old Castile there are the two <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> and Valladolid, the former of which has for its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> Palencia, <a href="../cathen/13458d.htm">Santander</a>, Calaborra (Logro&ntilde;o), and Osma (Soria), while the latter has Avila and <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>. In New Castile the Archdiocese of Toledo has the four suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid-Alcal&aacute;</a>, Guenca, Sig&uuml;enza (Guadalajara), and <a href="../cathen/03793d.htm">Ciudad Real</a>. In Aragon the Archdiocese of Saragossa has for its suffragans Jaca, <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>, <a href="../cathen/14452a.htm">Tarazona</a>, <a href="../cathen/02285b.htm">Barbastro</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14525a.htm">Teruel</a>.

<h2>Religious instruction and charitable institutions</h2>
<h3>Religious instruction</h3>

<p>There are <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and besides a number of colleges for youths intended for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (<em>collegios de vocaciones eclesi&aacute;sticas</em>). There are also numerous colleges under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>. The statistics of these independent <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> have never been published.
<h3>Charitable institutions</h3>

<p>Although charitable work is carried on extensively throughout <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, especially by the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, both of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, which devote themselves exclusively to such work, it is difficult to give exact figures, as some are under government control, while others are purely religious, and the statistics are very incomplete. Thus, official statistics, which place the total number of institutions at 356, give to Saragossa only two <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, whereas the "Anuario Eclesiastico" makes the number twenty-eight.
