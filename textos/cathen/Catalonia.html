<h1>Catalonia</h1>  

<p>A principality within the Spanish Monarchy, occupying an area of 12,414 square miles in the north-east corner of the Iberian Peninsula. The name is derived either from the compound <em>Gath-Alania,</em> referring to the occupation of that region by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> and Alans, or from <em>Gothaland,</em> or from <em>Catalanos,</em> supposed to have been the name of an indigenous people identical with Ptolemy's <em>Catalauni,</em> or, according to others again, from Otger Catalo, a hero of the Eastern Pyrenees who vanquished the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> about the year 756. The principality forms a right-angled triangle, of which the least side lies along the Eastern Pyrenees, the greater leg of the right angle forming the boundary of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, while the hypotenuse of the triangle is represented by the Mediterranean coastline. Thus Catalonia is bounded on the north by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (the ancient province of Roussillon) and the little independent republic of Andorra, on the west by <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, on the south-west by Valencia, and on the east by the Mediterranean. Its surface slopes gently from the Pyrenees down to the sea-coast on the one side and the basin of the Mediterranean on the other, the eastern portion being drained directly into the Mediterranean by the Ter and Llobregat rivers, the western by the Noguera and Segre into the Ebro. Of these rivers, only the Ebro is really navigable in any part of its course, though the Segre is used as a waterway for timber and the produce of the upland country.

<p>According to the census of 1900, Catalonia had a population of 1,960,620&mdash;an average of about 157.25 to the square mile. Its climate, somewhat cold in the north-east, is generally very temperate, the olive and fig being cultivated throughout and the orange in the maritime regions, which compare in beauty with the most celebrated portions of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Peopled, according to the most probable opinion, by Iberian races, Catalonia was from the earliest ages invaded by foreign settlers, the Greeks in particular founding the colonies of Rhodon (Rosas) and Emperion (Ampurias) on the beautiful Gulf of Rosas. The Carthaginians left no traces of their presence in Catalonia, although Hannibal marched across it; but the Romans, conquerors of Carthage, making themselves masters of the country, founded its civilization and its language. The Catalan language, a neo-Latin dialect, differs from <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> chiefly in the absence of doubled vowels and in the suppression of the unaccented syllables which follow an accent (e.g. <em>temps,</em> for <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> <em>tiempo,</em> "time"; <em>foc</em> for <em>fuego,</em> "fire"). Catalonia forms part of the Roman <em>Hispania Tarraconensis</em> and <em>Citerior,</em> and the country is still full of Roman remains. It next formed the first State established by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Astolfo having set up his court at Barcelona. When the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> took possession of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the lot of the Catalans was particularly hard, since their country, lying directly in the path which the Emirs followed on their victorious expeditions into Gaul, found it impossible to begin such a struggle for independence as the Asturians and the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragonese</a> had begun. But after the conquest of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> by <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, and their expulsion from Gallia Narbonensis, the Catalans could lift up their heads among the recesses of the Pyrenees, where they gathered under the leadership of Quintillian, an independent chief in the district of Montgrony. Soon <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> began his expeditions into Catalonia (778), conquering Gerona, <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, Ausona (the modern Vich), and <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a>. Louis the Pious, son and successor of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, formally undertook the conquest of Catalonia, which, under the name of Marca Hispanica (the Spanish March), he entrusted to Borrel. This district was ruled by dependent counts from 801 to 877, and in the latter year this dignity was made hereditary by the Diet of Quercy, Wilfrid the Hairy beginning a dynasty of counts who in a short time became independent. Wilfrid set the boundaries of his dominions at the rivers Segre and Llobregat, and founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Ripoll and Montserrat, the two centres of Catalan national life.

<p>Wilfrid was succeeded by Borrel I, Su&ntilde;er, and Borrel II, in whose time Almansor took and sacked Barcelona (985). In this period we find Catalonia divided into various countships&mdash;<a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, Ausona, <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a>, Ampurd&aacute;n, Perelada, Besal&uacute;, <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a>, etc.&mdash;now united, now separated, until the time of B&eacute;renger III. Ram&oacute;n B&eacute;renger I, the Old (1035-1076), published the <em>Usatges</em> (Customs), the first civil code of the Reconquest (1071), and left the throne to his two sons, of whom Ram&oacute;n B&eacute;renger II, called the Fratricide, because he was believed to have put his brother to death, was vanquished in an ordeal by combat, and journeyed to the Holy Land in penance for his crime. Ram&oacute;n B&eacute;renger III, the Great, married Dulcia, heiress of Provence, united the two countships, and entered upon the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragonese</a> policy of intervention in Italian affairs. Ram&oacute;n B&eacute;renger IV, the Saint, married Petronilla, daughter and heiress of Ramiro the Monk, thus bringing about the union (1137) of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> and Catalonia (see <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">C<font size=-2>ASTILE AND</font> A<font size=-2>RAGON</font></a>); he also finished the reconquest of Catalonia, capturing the cities of <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">Tortosa</a> and <a href="../cathen/09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>. After Alfonso-Ram&oacute;n, who succeeded to the kingdom and the countship in 1162, the histories of Catalonia and of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> are one. Especially worthy of note here are the conquests of Valencia (1238) and the Balearic Isles (1229), won chiefly by Jaim&eacute; the Conqueror. The latter were peopled mostly with Catalans, as the island dialects prove, the Majorcan still preserving a base of archaic Catalan, while in the Valencian there is an influx of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragonese</a>. The Order of Mercy, for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of captives, originally an <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">order of knighthood</a>, was founded on Catalan soil, in 1223, by <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a> and St., Raymund of Pe&ntilde;afort. In 1225, Philip the Bold, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, laid siege to Gerona and was defeated on the Coll de les Panises. An expedition of Catalan and <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragonese</a> allies, summoned to the Levant by the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus Pal&aelig;ologus, and commanded by Roger de Flor, founded, in 1313, the Latin Duchies of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> and Neo Patra. Lastly, it was with Catalan sailors and fleets that the kings of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, intervening in the affairs of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, possessed themselves of the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Kingdom of Sicily</a> (1282) and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (1420).



<p><a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> influence began to make itself felt in Catalonia from the time when the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> dynasty, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Fernando I, of Antequera, ascended the throne of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. The first important collision between Catalonia and her <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> rulers had its origin in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which Juan II, the husband of Do&ntilde;a Juana Enriquez, carried on against his son, the Prince of Viana, who was generally beloved by the Catalans. From this resulted a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> lasting twelve years. The marriage of Fernando (Ferdinand) II of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> with Isabel of Castile established Spanish unity and <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> preponderance, to which, also, the discovery of America in the name of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, together with the diversion of commerce from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, and the consequently diminishing <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> importance of Barcelona and other ports on that coast, largely contributed. Catalonia no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> played an important part in the direction of Spanish policies in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the principality lived in a state of contentment under the first three Austrian monarchs. But the misgovernment of Philip IV provoked an uprising in Catalonia (Feast of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, 1640), and the insurgents named Louis XIII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> Count of Barcelona. This insurrection, however, was suppressed by the Castilians. In the War of the Succession Catalonia embraced the cause of the Archduke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> against Philip V, who punished the Catalans (1713) by abolishing their ancient <em>fueros,</em> or constitutional <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Catalonia was the first region of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to rise against the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> tyranny, and overthrew the French in 1808.
<h2>Actual conditions</h2>

<p>What was anciently the Countship of Barcelona is now the Principality of Catalonia, divided into the four provinces of Barcelona, <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, <a href="../cathen/09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a>.

<p>The Province of Barcelona, with an area of 2965 square miles, includes 327 municipalities. Its principal city, Barcelona (pop. 525,977), beautifully situated between the sea and a chain of verdant mountains, possesses a port which is considered one of the best on the Mediterranean, both by nature and by its recent improvements. The city combines the attractions of a great modern <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> with the interesting associations of a long history, the presence of so many magnificent old buildings seeming to stimulate modern enterprise in the same direction. (See <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">B<font size=-2>ARCELONA</font></a>.) Many smaller cities&mdash;e.g. Sabadell, Tarrasa, Manresa (see <a href="../cathen/07638b.htm">I<font size=-2>GNATIUS</font> L<font size=-2>OYOLA,</font> S<font size=-2>AINT</font></a>), Reus&mdash;depend industrially on Barcelona, and the banks of the Llobregat and the Ter are bordered with paper-, spinning-, and other mills, which utilize the motive power of the numerous waterfalls.

<p>The 184 municipalities of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> aggregate 2503 square miles in area. The province produces wine, vinegar, and fruits in great abundance. Its capital, Tarragona (pop. 25,000), was selected by the Romans for its exceptionally fine situation upon a slight eminence, the sea on one side, and a very fertile fruit-producing district on the other; in spite of the excellence of its harbour, its importance has decreased through the transfer of industries to Reus and of commerce to Salou, a little farther south. Historically, Tarragona is one of the world's most interesting cities. Tortosa, an ancient <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, is also commercially famous for its vinegar.

<p>Lerida, the largest, but the least wealthy, province of Catalonia, has an area of 4685 square miles, divided into 324 municipal districts. Its resources are agricultural, chiefly fruits and timber. Besides L&eacute;rida, the capital (the ancient <em>Ilerda</em>), the most important cities of this province are: Cervera, in ancient times the seat of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> celebrated for its <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, Seo de Urgel, and <a href="../cathen/14138c.htm">Solsona</a>.

<p>The Province of <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a> (the ancient <em>Marca Hispanica</em>), with an area of 2361 square miles, divided into 249 municipal districts, has a generally mountainous surface, which produces large quantities of cork of the best quality. Its long coastline, with numerous small harbours, is excellently adapted for both fishing and navigation. Its principal cities are: Gerona, the capital (pop. about 15,000), a city of great historical importance, famous for its remarkable variety of mineral waters; Figueras, with its once redoubtable fortress; Olot, situated in a volcanic region abounding in springs.

<p>In the judiciary department of its government Catalonia is served by a single district court (<em>audiencia</em>), that of Barcelona, with criminal tribunals in the four provincial capitals, Barcelona having seventeen courts of first instance (five of them in the capital itself), Tarragona eight, L&eacute;rida eight, and Gerona six. In the military administration, the Captaincy-General of Catalonia is one of the fourteen military districts of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and is divided into four military governments. It belongs to the naval department of <a href="../cathen/03384b.htm">Cartagena</a>, and has stations at <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>, Matar&oacute;, and Palam&oacute;s. It has only one <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, that of Barcelona, with four provincial and two local institutes (Figueras and Reus).
<h2>Ecclesiastical divisions</h2>

<p>The principality of Catalonia forms the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> of which is, according to tradition, one of the most ancient in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, dating from the first century of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are Barcelona (a see claiming Apostolic origin), <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a>, <a href="../cathen/09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>, <a href="../cathen/14138c.htm">Solsona</a>, <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>, <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15405a.htm">Vich</a>. The following table gives briefly the most complete statistics obtainable of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities in the Province of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>:&mdash;
