<h1>Catania (Catanensis)</h1>  

<p>Catania, a seaport and capital of the province of the same name in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, is situated on the eastern side of Mount Etna in a very fertile region. It was known to the ancients as Catana or Catina. Founded (c. 730 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) by Chalcidian emigrants from Naxos, Catania was soon a flourishing city. Hiero I, King of <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a>, in 470 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> transported these first settlers to Leontini (now Lentini) and filled Catania with <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracusans</a> and Polopennesians. The former inhabitants attempted to regain possession of the city, but were driven back by Dionysius and Agathocles. Catania accepted the Roman yoke during the First Punic War, and after the fall of the Roman Empire shared the fate of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The city has suffered much from the eruptions of Etna. Most of its old monuments are buried under the lava. According to legend the Faith was first preached there by St. Beryllus, an immediate Disciple of Christ. During the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> the virgin <a href="../cathen/01203c.htm">St. Agatha</a> suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. At the same period or a little later the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Catania was St. Everus mentioned in the acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Leontini (303). This same year is marked by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">Deacon</a> Euplius and others. Domninus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Catania, was present at the Council of Ephesus (431); another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Fortunatus, was twice sent with Ennodius by Pope Hormisdas to Emperor Anastasius I to effect the union of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (514, 516). Bishops Leo and Junius appear in the correspondence of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>. In 730 Bishop Jacobus suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for his defence of images. Another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Leo II, was known as a wonder-worker (<em>thaumaturgus</em>). Bishop Euthymius was at first an adherent of Photius, but in the <a href="../cathen/04310b.htm">Eighth General Council</a> approved the restoration of Ignatius as patriarch. Among other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Catania may be noted, Giuliano della Rovere, later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was destroyed by the earthquake of 22 January, 1693, in which thousands of people met their death. The church <em>del San Carcere</em> contains beautiful <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of the eleventh century and a fine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of <a href="../cathen/01203c.htm">St. Agatha</a> by Bernardino <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">Negro</a>. The church of San Nicol&#242; possesses fine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and a magnificent <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> of 2916 pipes, built under Abbot Donato del Piano. The adjoining <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is famous for its <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and rich collection of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. In the ninth century, while still a Greek city, Catania became suffragan to <a href="../cathen/10508a.htm">Monreale</a>. In 1860 it was made an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The archdiocese contains 295,300 inhabitants, with 43 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 16 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men and 17 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and 47 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>.

<p>The University of Catania was founded by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Pope Eugenius IV</a> in 1444 with the co-operation of Alfonso, King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> of erection, besides establishing the usual faculties on the model of Bologna, authorized the teaching of Greek and Latin. Funds for the endowment were provided by the municipality of Catania and by royal grants. The privileges of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> were confirmed in 1458 and 1494. It comprises at present the Faculties of Law, Medicine, Natural Sciences, Philosophy and Letters, with 105 professors and 1100 students. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, founded in 1755 by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Vito Arnico, contains 120,000 volumes.
