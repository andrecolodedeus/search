<h1>Cathari</h1>  

<p>(From the Greek <em>katharos</em>, pure), literally "puritans", a name specifically applied to, or used by, several <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> at various periods. The <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a> of the third century were frequently known as Cathari, and the term was also used by the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>. In its more usual sense, Cathari was a general designation for the <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of the later Midde Ages. Numerous other names were in vogue to denominate these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Without speaking of the corrupted forms of "Cazzari", "Gazzari", in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and "Ketzer" in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, we find the following appellations: "Piphili", "Piphles", in Northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>; <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">"Arians"</a>, "Manich&aelig;ans", and "Patareni", owing to real or alleged <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> similarity; "Tesserants", "Textores" (Weavers), from the trade which many of the members followed. Sometimes they were <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> styled "Waldenses" by their contemporaries. From the demagogue <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Robert de Sperone, they were called "Arnoldist&aelig;" and "Speronist&aelig;". To their geographical distribution they owed the names of "Cathari of Desenzano" or <a href="../cathen/01253a.htm">"Albanenses"</a> (from Desenzano, between <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> and <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, or from Alba in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>, or perhaps from the provinces of <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albania</a>); "Bajolenses" or "Bagnolenses" (from Bagnolo in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>); "Concorrezenses" (probably from Concorrezo in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>); "Tolosani" (from <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>); and especially <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">"Albigenses"</a> (from <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a>). The designations "Pauliciani", of which "Publicani", "Poplicani", were probably corruptions, and "Bulgari", "Bugri", "Bougres", point to their probable Oriental origin.

<p>Among recent historians there is a pronounced tendency to look upon the Cathari as the lineal descendants of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, organization, and liturgy of the former, in many points, reproduce the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, organization, and liturgy of the early disciples of Manes. The successive appearance of the Priscillianists, the <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a>, and the Bogomili, representatives to some extent of similar principles, fairly establishes the historical continuity between the two extreme links of the chain &#151; the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> of the third, and the Cathari of the eleventh, century. In the present state of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, however, conclusive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> in favour of the genetical dependence of the Cathari on the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> are lacking. Some differences between the two religious systems are too radical to find a sufficient explanation in the appeal to the evolution of human thought. Among the Cathari we look in vain for that <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> mythology, that <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> symbolism, and the worship of the memory of Manes, which were important characteristics of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>. However attractive it may be to trace the origin of the Cathari to the first centuries of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, we must be cautious not to accept as a certain historical fact what, up to the present, is only a probable conclusion.
<h2 id="section1">Catharist principles</h2>

<p>The essential characteristic of the Catharist <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a good and an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle, of whom the former created the invisible and spiritual <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, while the latter was the author of the material world. A difference of opinion existed as to the nature of these two principles. Their perfect equality was admitted by the absolute <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualists</a>, whereas in the mitigated form of <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> the beneficent principle alone was eternal and supreme, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle being inferior to him and a mere creature. In the East and the West these two different interpretations of <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> coexisted. The Bogomili in the East professed it in its modified form. In the West, the <a href="../cathen/01253a.htm">Albanenses</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and almost all the non-Italian Cathari were rigid <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualists</a>; mitigated <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> prevailed among the Bagnolenses and Concorrezenses, who were more numerous than the <a href="../cathen/01253a.htm">Albanenses</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, though but little represented abroad. (For an exposition of absolute <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>, see <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">ALBIGENSES</a>; on the mitigated form, see BOGOMILI.) Not only were the <a href="../cathen/01253a.htm">Albanenses</a> and Concorrezenses opposed to each other to the extent of indulging in mutual condemnations, but there was division among the <a href="../cathen/01253a.htm">Albanenses</a> themselves. John of Lugio, or of <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, introduced innovations into the traditional <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> system, which was defended by his (perhaps only spiritual) father Balasinansa, or Belesmagra, the Catharist <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. Towards the year 1230 John became the leader of a new party composed of the younger and more independent elements of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. In the two coeternal principles of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he sees two contending gods, who limit each other's liberty. Infinite perfection is no attribute even of the good principle; owing to the genius of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> infused into all its creatures, it can produce only imperfect beings. The Bagnolenses and Concorrezenses also differed on some <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> questions. The former maintained that human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were created and had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before the world was formed. The Concorrezenses taught that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> infused into the body of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>, his handiwork, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who had been guilty of a slight transgression and from whom, by way of generation, all human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are derived. The moral system, organization, and liturgy of absolute and mitigated <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> exhibit no substantial difference, and have been treated in the article on the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>.


<h2 id="section2">History</h2>
<h3>France, Belgium and Spain</h3>

<p>Although there is no historical foundation for the legend that the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> Fontanus, one of St. Augustine's opponents, came to the castle of Montwimer (Montaim&eacute; in the Diocese of Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne) and there spread <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> principles, yet Montwimer was perhaps the oldest Catharist centre in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and certainly the principal one in the country north of the Loire. It is in the central part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> that we come upon the first important manifestation of Catharism. At a council held in 1022 at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in presence of King Robert the Pious, thirteen Cathari were condemned to be burned. Ten of these were canons of the church of the Holy Cross and another had been confessor to Queen Constance. About the same time (1025), <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of similar tenets, who acknowledged that they were disciples of the Italian Gundulf, appeared at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> and <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>. Upon their recantation, perhaps more apparent than real, they were left unmolested. The sectarians appeared again at <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a> under Bishop Roger II (1043-65), who in 1045 applied to his fellow-bishop, Wazo of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, for advice regarding their treatment. The latter advised indulgence. No manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in North <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> is recorded during the second half of the eleventh century; its secret existence, however, cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>.

<p>A new outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> occurred in the twelfth century both in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. In 1114 several <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who had been captured in the <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Diocese of Soissons</a> were seized and burned by the populace while their case was under discussion at the Council of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>. Others were either threatened with, or actually met a similar fate at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> in 1144; some of them were spared owing only to the energetic intervention of the local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Adalbero II. During the rest of the twelfth century, Cathari appeared in rapid succession in different places. In 1162 Henry, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, while on a visit to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, found them widely spread in that part of his <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. Upon his refusal of a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> of six hundred marks, which they are said to have offered him for toleration, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, who was inclined to mercy in spite of King Louis VII's advocacy of rigorous measures. At V&eacute;zelay in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> seven <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were burned in 1167. Towards the end of the century the Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, Phililp I, was remarkable for his severity towards them, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, Guillaume de Champagne (1176-1202), vigorously seconded his efforts. Confiscation, exile, and death were the penalties inflicted upon them by Hugues, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Auxerre (1183-1206). The execution of about one hundred and eighty <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> at Montwimer in May, 1239, was the death-blow of Catharism in those countries. Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where its adherents were known as <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, was its principal stronghold in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Thence the Cathari penetrated into the northern provinces of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>: Catalonia, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>. Partisans of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> existed in the peninsula about 1159. At the beginning of the thirteenth century, King Pedro II of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> personally led his troops to the assistance of <a href="../cathen/12670a.htm">Raymond VI</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Catholic Crusaders</a>, and fell at the battle of Muret in 1213. During that century a few sporadic manifestations of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> took place, at Castelbo in 1225 and again in 1234, at <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a> in 1232. The Cathari however never gained a firm foothold in the country and are not mentioned after 1292.
<h3>Italy</h3>

<p>Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was, after Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the principal seat of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Between 1030-1040 an important Catharist community was discovered at the castle of Monteforte near Asti in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>. Some of the members were seized by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02018b.htm">Asti</a> and a number of noblemen of the neighbourhood, and, on their refusal to retract, were burned. Others, by order of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Eriberto, were brought to his <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> city, where he hoped to convert them. They answered his fruitless efforts by attempts to make <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselytes</a>; whereupon the civil magistrates gave them the choice between the Cross and the stake. For the most part, they preferred death to conversion. In the twelfth century, when, after prolonged silence, historical records again speak of Catharism, it exhibits itself as strongly organized. We find it very powerful in 1125 at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, a city of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, which, in spite of the stringent measures taken to suppress the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, was for many subsequent years deeply infected. <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> was the great <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> capital; but there was hardly a part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> where the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was not represented. It penetrated into Calabria, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, and appeared even in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The prohibitions and penalties enacted by the civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rulers of the thirteenth century could not crush the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, although the merciless <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> occupied the imperial throne and Popes <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> were not remiss in their efforts to suppress it. To prevent the enforcement of the punishment decreed against them, the members of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, on a few occasions, resorted to assassination, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the deaths of St. Peter Parenzo (1199) and <a href="../cathen/11773d.htm">St. Peter of Verona</a> (1252); or, like Pungilovo, who after his death (1269) was temporarily <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint by the local <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, they outwardly observed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> practices while remaining faithful Catharists. According to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> inquisitor, <a href="../cathen/13292b.htm">Rainier Sacconi</a>, himself a former adherent of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, there were in the middle of the thirteenth century about 4000 perfected Cathari in the world. Of these there were in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and the Marches, 500 of the <a href="../cathen/01253a.htm">Albanensian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, about 200 Bagnolenses, 1500 Concorrezenses, and 150 French refugees; at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> 100, and as many at Florence and <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. Although the increase in the number of "Believers" was very probably not proportionate to that of the "Perfecti", in consequence of the arrival of refugees from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, yet the Cathari of the northern half of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> formed at this time over three-fifths of the total membership. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, however, could not hold its own during the second half of the thirteenth century, and although it continued in existence in the fourteenth, it gradually disappeared from the cities and took refuge in less accessible places. St. Vincent Ferrer still discovered and converted some Cathari in 1403 in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and also in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, where in 1412 several of them, already deceased, were executed in effigy. No definite reference to their existence is found at a subsequent date.
<h3>Germany and England</h3>

<p>Catharism was comparatively unimportant in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> it appeared principally in the Rhine lands. Some members were apprehended in 1052 at Goslar in <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> and hanged by order of the emperor, Henry III. About 1110 some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, probably Cathari, and among them two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, appeared at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, but do not seem to have been subjected to any penalty. Some years later (c. 1143) Cathari were discovered at Cologne. Some of them retracted; but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> and his <em>socius</em> (companion), not so ready to change their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, were cited before an ecclesiastico-lay tribunal. During the trial they were, against the will of the judges, carried off by the people and burned. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Church must have been completely organized in this part of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, as the presence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> seems to prove. To these events we owe the refutation of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> written by <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> at the request of Everwin, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Steinfeld. In 1163 the Rhenish city witnessed another execution, and a similar scene was almost simultaneously enacted at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>. Other districts, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Suabia, and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, were infected, but the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> did not gain a firm foothold. It disappeared almost completely in the thirteenth century.

<p>About 1159, thirty Cathari, German in race and speech, left an unknown place, perhaps <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, to seek refuge in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Their proselytizing efforts were rewarded by the temporary conversion of one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. They were detected in 1166 and handed over to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Council of Oxford. Henry II ordered them to be scourged, branded on the forehead, and cast adrift in the cold of winter, and forbade any of his subjects to shelter or succour them. They all perished from hunger or exposure.
<h3>The Balkan states</h3>

<p>Eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> seems to have been, in point of date, the first country in which Catharism manifested itself, and it certainly was the last to be freed from it. The Bogomili, who were representatives of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in its milder <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> form, perhaps existed as early as the tenth century and, at a later date, were found in large numbers in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>. Bosnia was another Catharist centre. Some recent writers make no distinction between the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> found there and the Bogomili, whereas others rank them with the rigid <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualists</a>. In the Western contemporary documents they are usually called "Patareni", the designation then applied to the Cathari in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. At the end of the twelfth century, Kulin, the <em>ban</em> or civil ruler of <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia</a> (1168-1204) embraced the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and 10,000 of his subjects followed his example. The efforts made on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, under the direction of Popes <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, to eradicate the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, were not productive of any permanent success. Noble work was accomplished by <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaires sent to Bosnia by <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Pope Nicholas IV</a> (1288-92). But though arms and persuasion were used against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, it continued to flourish. As the country was for a long time a <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a> dependency, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> was conspicuous in its resistance to the new <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This situation developed into a source of weakness on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, as the Cathari identified their religious cause with that of national independence. When, in the fifteenth century, the Bosnian king, Thomas, was converted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, the severe edicts which he issued against his former coreligionists were powerless against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The Cathari, 40,000 in number, left Bosnia and passed into <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Herzegovina</a> (1446). The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> disappeared only after the conquest of these provinces by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in the second half of the fifteenth century. Several thousand of its members joined the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, while many more embraced <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>.
<h2 id="section3">The Cathari and the Catholic Church</h2>

<p>The Catharist system was a simultaneous attack on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the then existing State. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was directly assailed in its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. The denial of the value of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, and the suppression, at least in theory, of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to punish, undermined the basis of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> State. But the worst danger was that the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> principles meant the extinction of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. This annihilation was the direct consequence of the Catharist <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, that all intercourse between the sexes ought to be avoided and that <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> or the <em>Endura</em>, under certain circumstances, is not only lawful but commendable. The assertion of some writers, like Charles Molinier, that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Catharist teaching respecting marriage are identical, is an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> interpretation of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and practice. Among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is forbidden to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, but the faithful can merit eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the married state. For the Cathari, no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was possible without previous renunciation of marriage. Mr. H.C. Lea, who cannot be suspected of partiality towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, writes: "However much we may deprecate the means used for its (Catharism) suppression and commiserate those who suffered for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience'</a> sake, we cannot but admit that the cause of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> was in this case the cause of progress and civilization. Had Catharism become dominant, or even had it been allowed to exist on equal terms, its influence could not have failed to prove disastrous." (See Lea, <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, I, 106.)
