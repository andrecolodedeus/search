<h1>Cathedra</h1>  

<p>(1) The chair or throne (<em>thronos</em>) of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, on which he presides at solemn functions. Originally the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> cathedra stood in the center of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, flanked on either side, though on a lower plane, by the benches of the assisting <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. A good <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the arrangement may be had from the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> frescoes representing Christ seated on a throne surrounded by the apostles, whom He is instructing in their future <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and in the fourth century <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of St. Pudenziana. The earliest type of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> throne consisted of a high-backed armchair, rounded at the top, made out of a single block of marble. The stone seats in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a> of similar form were probably used by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the occasional services of the subterranean <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. Wooden episcopal chairs were in use in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. The marble chair supporting the famous <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a> (third century) is an excellent example of an ancient cathedra; the back has less than half the elevation of the thrones of the fourth and fifth centuries. In several Roman <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> e.g. <a href="../cathen/11781b.htm">St. Petronilla</a>, St. Bablina, and Sts. Nereus and Achilleus, a niche for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> cathedra was constructed in the wall of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, but this arrangement was exceptional. An example of a cathedra with a perforated seat, like those used in the Roman baths, is preserved at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. The form and decoration of the most ancient of episcopal cathedrae were borrowed from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>; one side of the chair of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a>, however, is engraved with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> computation of the paschal cycle from the year 222 to 334. During the early centuries of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> it was customary for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to deliver his sermon or <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> while seated in his chair facing the congregation, but in the great <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of the Constantinian era, as well as subsequently, this arrangement became impracticable; it would have been extremely difficult in a large church to be heard from this location, particularly in a church where the altar was surmounted by a <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a>. <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> was accustomed to address his great audience from the better-adapted <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector's</a> ambon in front of the altar. It appears probable also that in some instances the episcopal cathedra was moveable, and thus could be placed near the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> while the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> addressed the congregation. This inference is suggested by the famous chair of Bishop Maximianus at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, the back of which, as well as the sides, contains sculptured ornamentation; if the chair was to remain stationary against the wall of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, the adornment of the back would have been superfluous. In a church ornamented with an iconostasis, a moveable episcopal chair became especially <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> wished to preach from his throne, for otherwise he would be almost wholly shut out from view of the congregation. The two most famous ancient cathedrae still preserved are the chair of Maximianus mentioned above, and the chair of St. Peter. The latter, a moveable chair, stood in the time of Ennodius of Pavia (d.521), who alludes to it, in the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. During the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> (1655-1667) it was encased in the bronze throne in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the new St. Peter's, where it remained invisible till 1867. It was then, on the occasion of the eighteenth centenary of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul, by order of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, removed from its bronze enclosure and exposed to the gaze of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> took advantage of the moment, and gave a description of the chair in his "Bullettino" (1867, 33 sqq.). The oak framework, in which four large rings are fastened, is regarded as of much greater antiquity than the other parts of the cathedra; the presence of the rings suggests the inference that originally the chair was one of the "sedes gestatoriae", which came into fashion in the reign of Claudius (41-54). The wear and tear of time, and the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the relic-hunter, made extensive repairs <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> at a later period, perhaps in the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The oak frame was reinforced by the insertion of pieces of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">acacia</a>, and new panels of the same wood were made for the front and sides. The front panel is adorned with square slabs of <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, disposed in three rows of six each, representing the labors of Hercules. Some of these slabs are placed upside down and were not, apparently, made for the places they occupy. The <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> ornaments of the back, on the contrary, are well adapted to the form of the chair; they represent the combats of animals, of centaurs and of men. In the center of the horizontal bar of the tympanum is the figure of an emperor, between two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, variously supposed to represent <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, Charles the Bald, or an emperor of the seventeenth century. The ivories of the front panel are attributed to .the fifth century. The beautiful <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> chair of Bishop Maximianus (so called from the monogram in front, "Maximianus ep.") preserved in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> is an excellent specimen of fifth- or sixth-century <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> carving. Until recently it was attributed to the pontificate of Bishop Maximianus of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (d. 556), but Venturi (Storia dell' Arte Ital., I, 466) attributes it rather to Maximianus of Constantinople (d. 431). The back is engraved with twenty four scenes from the life of Christ and the Blessed Virgin, the front represents <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> with the four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, while on the sides the story of Joseph, in ten scenes, is depicted. Occasionally, the cathedra was covered by a baldachino, e.g. at Torcello and Grado. The marble cathedra of St. Mark, in his church at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, is of great antiquity (Secchi, La catedra di San Marco, Venice, 1835).

<p>(2) The term cathedra was applied also to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The earliest use of the word in this sense occurs in <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, who speaks (De praescriptione, XXXVI) of "cathedrae Apostolorum" in allusion to <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolic succession</a> in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>. In the councils and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writings of the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> such expressions as "cathedrae viduatae", "cathedrae principales", "cathedrae matrices" have a similar signification. For the feast of the "chair" or "cathedra" of St. Peter at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, see <a href="../cathen/03551e.htm">CHAIR OF PETER</a>.

<p>(3) Canon 41 of the Council of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, held in 789, refers to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> as distinguished from other churches of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as "principalis cathedrae"; the term for the official seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is thus employed for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> church. By a definition "ex cathedra" is meant a formal <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> decision of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.
