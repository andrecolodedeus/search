<h1>Cathedraticum</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>cathedra,</em> episcopal seat or throne).

<p>A certain sum of money to be contributed annually for the support of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as a mark of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and in sign of subjection to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, hence its name. In the early ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, contributions for the support of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> were tendered rather through custom than by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The earliest legislation on the subject seems to be a canon of the Second Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (572). According to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of this council, only <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and chapters were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to pay the cathedraticum (Can. Placuit, 10, qu. 3). The reason given for this limitation is that at the time of the Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were administered to the faithful in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> churches only. When in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, many other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> edifices were built and endowed, it was judged proper that these also should pay the cathedraticum. Hence Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> made a universal law (cap. Conquerente, de Off. Ordin.) that not only chapters and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, but also endowed <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> should be subject to the same tax (Rota coram Tan. decis, 228). This sum was to be paid to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on the occasion of his annual <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">visitation</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The amount of the cathedraticum was fixed in ancient times at two <em>solidi</em>; a solidus was one seventy-second part of a pound of gold. According to canonists, this remains the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> amount of the tax, unless custom establishes a different sum. If a smaller amount than the original tax becomes customary in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be content with this reduced pension, nor can he command a return to the higher sum (S. C. C. in Amalph., 1705). In general it is presumed that the quantity of the cathedraticum will be determined by reasonable custom according to the exigencies of various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and countries. Where custom has not fixed the sum, the S. Congregation of the Council declared that either the amount paid by a neighbouring diocese or the equivalent of the original two <em>solidi</em> must be taken as the proper tax (In Albin., 1644).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to pay the cathedraticum for their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and conventual churches, as is expressly stated in the "Corpus Juris" (cap. Inter c&aelig;tera, viii, caus. 10). The reason is found in the very <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the cathedraticum, which is given by a church or <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> in sign of subjection to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. As exempt regulars are <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, there is no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> on them to pay the cathedraticum. In the case, however, that regulars administer <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches or secular <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, they are subject to the tax, inasmuch as such institutions fall under <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> law. It has also been declared that confraternities which have no churches in the strict sense of the word, but only <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, are exempt from this episcopal tax ("In Firmana, Cathedr."). As the cathedraticum pertains to episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, it is privileged and consequently no prescription can totally abrogate it. This is expressly declared by the S. Congregation of the Council (In Amalph., 1707), when it decrees that no contrary custom, even of immemorial antiquity, can exempt from the payment of this tax. It is also to be noted that, according to the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, the cathedraticum is to be uniform for all institutions in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, without regard to the opulence or poverty of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>.

<p>Owing to the phraseology of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, cap. ii), a controversy arose as to whether this council had abrogated the cathedraticum. The S. Congregation of the Council gave the following interpretation: "The Council did not abolish the cathedraticum; but desired that it be paid, not at the time of the episcopal visitation, but rather at the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod." It is owing to the custom of paying this tax at the synod that the name <em>synodaticum</em> has been given to it. By law, however, there is, strictly speaking, no fixed time for making this payment. For although as a rule it is customary to do so in the synod, yet custom or agreement can place it at another time. In fact the S. Congregation of the Council has declared that the cathedraticum must be paid, even in those years in which no <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod is celebrated (In Perus., Cathedr., 1735). As the cathedraticum is a mark of subjection to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot exempt any <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> from this tax. On the other hand he cannot demand it from <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who have no <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, even though he plead ancient custom to the contrary (S. C. Ep. In Compsan., 1694). He can require it, however, from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> if <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> have been incorporated with it. In like manner he can demand the cathedraticum from <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> with which secular churches and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> have been united. An exception to this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was made, however, for the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Order of St. John of Jerusalem</a> in 1630.

<p>All this concerns the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> on the cathedraticum where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is canonically established. Obviously, in so-called missionary countries, where <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> are practically unknown, such <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> cannot apply. As, however, it is only equitable that the diocese should support its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, especially as he has no episcopal <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, a pension which retains the canonical name of cathedraticum is usually paid to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in most missionary countries. There is no uniform law on the subject. The question necessarily occupied the attention of various <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and the conclusion was unanimous that a tax analogous to the cathedraticum should be imposed on <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> for the support of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Thus the Eighth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02239a.htm">B<font size=-2 >ALTIMORE,</font> P<font size=-2>ROVINCIAL</font> C<font size=-2 >OUNCILS OF</font></a>), held in 1855, declares in its seventh <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>: "As it is just that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who watches over the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all, should receive from all the faithful of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> whatever is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for his proper support and for enabling him to execute his office, we <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> that he may demand for this purpose a part of the revenues of all churches in which the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is exercised". The Cardinal Prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, writing to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Province of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> in 1857, says: "The right of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to receive support from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has been recognized; nevertheless, the application and determination of the means of support can best be treated of in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, because cognizance can then be taken of the state and condition of each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>". The <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> in 1856 calls this subsidy the "right of cathedraticum, either to sustain the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or to provide for various necessities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>". It states that each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the province should determine the amount in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod. In <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a> in 1857 declares: "As the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is constituted not for one part but for all parts of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and as he labours and watches for all alike, all are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to contribute for his proper sustenance". The <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> in 1866, likewise states that "it is evidently equitable and just that all the faithful of each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> should contribute to the support of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who bears the solicitude for all".

<p>As to the determination of the quantity of the cathedraticum, we find the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> requesting <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> to sanction some uniform method, but the latter preferred to commit this to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. In the acts of the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Quebec in 1851, we fine the following scheme "proposed" to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. It is there said to be similar to that already sanctioned for some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>: each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to receive a third of the revenues of one or two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; or the fourth or fifth part of three or four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; or the tenth part of practically all the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, having regard to the circumstances of each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> sanctioned the employment of the last-named provision in 1852. In the Province of <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, it was decreed in 1857 that a collection be taken up annually in October for the support of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the Third <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Westminster in 1859 placed the amount of the cathedraticum at one half pound sterling. It declared that the liability to pay this tax was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on each <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter; on <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for the mission, who receive salaries from churches or <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>; on those who have the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>; and on all who preside over churches and public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> unless they can prove a special exemption.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, the Eighth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, when vindicating the right of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to part of the revenues of the churches, enumerates as such revenues, the renting of pews, the collections taken up during Mass, and the offerings made at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> and marriages. An identical <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was adopted by the Second Council of the Province of Australia in 1869, but <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> did not sanction it and declared that the matter should preferably be determined by the various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. This was likewise the opinion of the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> in 1866. As a consequence, different methods of computing the cathedraticum prevail throughout the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In one prominent diocese, for example, the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of each church must pay one-fifth of his revenue if it exceed one thousand dollars, or one-third if it be less. The revenue in question is declared to be made up of the pew rents, the collections during Divine service and the funeral stipends. Finally the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> arrangement for the cathedraticum has been declared by <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (as in 1872) to be a binding law on those whom it concerns.
