<h1>Catholic Indian Missions of the United States</h1>  

<p>The spiritual welfare of the native tribes of America was a subject of deep concern to the Governments of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from the very discovery of the Western Continent. To this fact all the early patents bear witness. That granted to <a href="../cathen/02164c.htm">Ayll&oacute;n</a> in 1532 for exploration and settlement along the Florida coast, as quoted by Shea, is typical: "Whereas our principal intent in the discovery of new lands is that the inhabitants and natives thereof, who are without the light or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, may be brought to understand the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, that they may come to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof, and become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and be saved, and this is the chief motive that you are to bear and hold in this affair, and to this end it is proper that religious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should accompany you, by these presents I empower you to carry to the said land the religious whom you may judge <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and the vestments and other things needful for the observance of Divine worship; and I command that whatever you shall thus expend in transporting the said religious, as well as in maintaining them and giving them what is needful, and in their support, and for the vestments and other articles required for the Divine worship, shall be paid entirely from the rents and profits which in any manner shall belong to us in the said land." With few exceptions <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and missionaries accompanied every Spanish expedition of discovery. The first Mass celebrated within the present limits of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was probably that offered up by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/12228a.htm">Ponce de Le&oacute;n's</a> expedition at the south-western point of <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a> in 1521. The next was celebrated by the noted <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/10534b.htm">Antonio de Montesinos</a>, the earliest opponent of Indian slavery, at <a href="../cathen/02164c.htm">Ayll&oacute;n's</a> temporary colony of San Miguel de Guandape in Virginia in 1526, eighty years before the founding of Jamestown.
<h2 id="section1">South-eastern states (Virginia to Alabama, inclusive)</h2>

<p>The whole south-eastern portion of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, extending westwards to or beyond the Mississippi, was known in the early Spanish period under the general name of <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>. Although at least fifteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had lost their lives in this region with the expeditions of Narv&aacute;ez and De Soto in 1527-28 and 1539-42, an attempt to evangelise the native tribes was made in 1549 by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/03244b.htm">Luis Cancer</a>, the apostle of <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, under a royal commission granted at his own request for the conversion of Florida. Forced by the obstinacy of the ship-captain to land at Tampa Bay among the fierce Calusa, instead of being given an opportunity to search out a friendly tribe <a href="../cathen/03244b.htm">Father Cancer</a> and his two companions had hardly touched the shore when they were killed by the assembled savages in sight of the ship, being thus the first missionary <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the eastern <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>, the first permanent settlement in the eastern <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, was founded by Men&eacute;ndez in 1565. In the next year, at the request of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, three <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were sent out, one of whom, Father Pedro Mart&iacute;nez, having landed with a small party on Cumberland Island on the Georgia coast, was attacked and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the savages. The other two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Father Juan Rogel and Brother Francisco de Villareal, after spending a winter studying the language, proceeded to work among the Calusa tribe in southern Florida. Reinforced by ten more <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1568, they went over to Havana to establish there a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for Indian boys from <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>. Father Juan Bautista Segura, as <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> vice-provincial, then took charge of the Florida mission, establishing stations among the Calusa, Tegesta, and Tocobaga tribes of the south and west coasts, while Father Antonio Sede&ntilde;o and Brother Domingo B&aacute;ez began the first Georgia mission on Guale (St. Simon&#8217;s?) Island among the Yamasee, in whose language Brother B&aacute;ez prepared a grammar and a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. In 1569 Father Rogel with several other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> began work in South Carolina among the Orista (Edisto) and others in the neighbourhood of the Spanish post of Santa Elena. After about a year, the results proving unsatisfactory, both the Orista and the Guale missions were abandoned, the missionaries returning to Havana with a number of boys for the Indian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.

<p>In 1570 Father Segura, accompanied by Father Luis de Quiros and seven (?) <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, all <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, together with four instructed Indian youths, undertook a mission among the Powhatan Indians in what is now Virginia. The guide and interpreter on whom they depended to bring them into touch with the natives was a young Indian of the region, who was the brother of a local chief and had been brought off by a Spanish expedition nine years before, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> under the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in Mexico and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> under the name and title of Don Luis de Velasco. Their destination was Axacan (Oshacon) &#8211; supposed by Shea to have been on the Rappahannock &#8211; but more probably situated farther south. They met with friendly reception, and a log <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was erected (September, 1570), but, before the winter was over, Don Luis <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> treacherous, and under his leadership the Indians attacked the mission (February, 1571) and massacred the entire party with the exception of one Indian boy, who was spared, and finally escaped to tell the tale. The massacre was avenged on the principals by Men&eacute;ndez a year later. In consequence of the small result in Florida the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were shortly afterwards transferred to the more promising field of Mexico. Years afterwards, on the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colony of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, some attention was given to the neighbouring Indians of Virginia (see below). In 1577 several <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> under charge of Father Alonso de Reynoso arrived at St. Augustine and began work among the Timucua Indians near the city, of whom a number were soon regular attendants at the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. Fifteen years later four <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and two <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> were at work in the towns of the Timucua and Yamasee from St. Augustine northwards into <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>. In 1593 twelve more were sent out in charge of Father Juan de Silva, including the noted <a href="../cathen/11478b.htm">Father Francisco Pareja</a>, to whom we are indebted for our most complete account of the Timucua people and language and for several devotional works, the first books printed in any Indian language of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.



<p>In 1597 a chief of the Yamasee organised a conspiracy which seems to have included also a part of the Timucua tribe about St. Augustine. Five missions, stretching from St. Augustine to Ossabaw island in <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, were attacked and five of the six missionaries <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>, Father De Avila (or D&aacute;vila), although badly wounded, being rescued. The advance of the Indians was finally checked by some Spanish troops, after all the Yamasee missions had been destroyed. The missions among the more peaceful Timucua about the lower Saint John's River, <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>, continued to flourish, being in 1602 four in number, besides temporary stations, with 1200 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indians. Other <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> arriving, the Yamasee missions were re-established in 1605, the Potano tribe on the Suwanee river almost entirely <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> two years later, and a beginning made among the lower Creek bands. In 1633 missionaries were sent to the powerful Apalachee of western Florida in response to repeated requests from that tribe. In 1655 there were 35 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missions in <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a> and Georgia with a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indian population of 26,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. This was the zenith of their prosperity. Two years later the Apalachee, in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> exactions of the governor, became involved in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, which compelled the abandonment of the eight flourishing missions in that territory. The fathers embarked for Havana, but were all drowned on the passage. In 1674, through the efforts of Bishop Calder&oacute;n, the Apalachee mission was restored, and several new foundations established. In 1684 the Diocesan Synod of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> regulations for the government and protection of the mission Indians. In the same year the Governor of Florida, alarmed at the growing strength of the English colony of Carolina, undertook to remove the Indians of the northern missions to more southern settlements with the result that the Yamasee again revolted and, being supplied with guns by the English, attacked and destroyed the mission on Saint Catherine island, <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, and carried off a troop of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indians <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> to sell as slaves in Carolina. In 1696 an attempt to establish missions about Cape Ca&ntilde;averal resulted in the killing of a religious and six companions. A like attempt in the next year among the fierce Calusa south of Tampa Bay also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> abortive.

<p>For years the English slave-traders of Carolina had made a business of arming certain tribes with guns and sending them out to make raids upon other tribes to procure slaves for Carolina and the Barbadoes. The Spanish Government, on the contrary, refused guns even to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indians. The War of the Spanish Succession gave an opportunity for an attack upon the Florida missions. In May, 1702, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Lower Creeks, armed and instigated by Governor Moore of Carolina, attacked Santa F&eacute;, occupied by the Timucua, and burnt the church. In October of the same year a combined English and Indian land expedition, co-operating with a naval force, attacked the mission towns north of St. Augustine, burned three of them with their churches, made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> the missionaries, and then, proceeding farther southward, burned the town of St. Augustine with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and one of the finest <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> then in America. The fortress held out until relieved by a Spanish fleet. In January, 1704, Moore, at the head of about fifty Carolina men and a thousand or more well-armed Creek, Catawba, and other savages, ravaged the Apalachee country, destroyed ten of the eleven missions towns, slaughtered hundreds of the people, including a number of warriors who made a stand under the Spanish lieutenant Mexia, and carried off nearly 1400 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indians to be sold as slaves in Carolina or distributed for torture or adoption among the savages. The missions, with their churches, gardens, and orange groves, were utterly demolished, the vestments and <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> destroyed or carried off, and numbers of the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> burned at the stake. Four of the mission fathers were also killed (two being tortured and burned at the stake), and their bodies hacked to pieces by deliberate permission of Moore himself, who gave up Lieutenant Mexia and four Spanish soldiers to the same fate.

<p>This was practically the end of the Florida missions, although for more than twenty years thereafter efforts were made, with some temporary success, to gather together again the remnants of the Apalachee, Timucua, and other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tribes, and in 1726 there were still counted more than 1000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indians. With the establishment of the English Georgia colony and the ensuing <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1740 the attempt was abandoned and the mission territory reverted to its original wild condition. In 1753 only 136 Indians remained in four mission stations close to St. Augustine. In 1743 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Monaco and Jos&eacute; Xavier de Alana began a mission near Cape Florida among the utterly savage A&iuml;s and Job&eacute; with such success that a community of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indians was built up, which continued until the Seminole War (1817-18).
<h2 id="section2">Maryland</h2>

<p>The English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colony of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, founded in 1634, was served in its first years by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who made the Indians their special care. Under the superior, <a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">Father Andrew White</a>, and his companions, several missions were established among the Piscataway (Conoy) and Patuxent of lower <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, west of Chesapeake Bay, and considerable attention was also given to the Potomac tribe in <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>. The principal mission was begun in 1639 at Kittamaquindi, or Piscataway, near the mouth of the creek of that name. Other stations were Mattapony on the Patuxent, Anacostan (Anacostia) adjoining the present Washington, and Potopaco (Port Tobacco), where nearly all the natives were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. In 1642, during an extended visit among the Potomac, on the Virginia side, <a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">Father White</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the chief and principal men, with a number of others. The work was much hampered by the inroads of the hostile Susquehanna from the head of the bay, and was brought to a sudden and premature close in 1645 by the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> and other malcontents, who, taking advantage of the Civil War in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, repaid the generosity which had given them asylum in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> by seizing the Government, plundering the churches and missions and the houses of the principal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and sending Fathers <a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">White</a> and <a href="../cathen/06083b.htm">Copley</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to be tried for their lives, while Father Martwell, the new superior, and two other missionaries escaped to Virginia. Later efforts to revive the mission had only temporary success owing to the hostility of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Government and the rapid wasting of the native tribes. Before 1700 the remnant of the Piscataway removed bodily from <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and sought refuge in the north with the Delawares and <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, among whom they have long since become entirely extinct. To <a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">Father White's</a> anonymous "Relatio itineris ad Marylandiam" (translation published in 1833 and again in 1874) we are indebted for the best account of the western <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> tribes. He also composed an Indian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, still extant, and a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> grammar of the Piscataway language, now unfortunately lost, the first attempt at an Indian grammar by an Englishman and antedating Eliot's Bible by at least a dozen years. (See <a href="../cathen/12114a.htm">PISCATAWAY INDIANS</a>.)

<p>NEW ENGLAND. &#8211; The earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mission on the soil of New England was that of Saint-Sauveur begun among the Abenakis in connexion with a French post on Mount Desert Island, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, by <a href="../cathen/02541d.htm">Father Pierre Biard</a> and three other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1613. Both post and mission were destroyed a few months later by the English captain Argall, Brother Du Thet being killed in the attack and Fathers <a href="../cathen/02541d.htm">Biard</a> and Quentin carried <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> to Virginia. In 1619 the Recollects arrived to minister to the French fishermen scattered along the coast, and gave attention also to the Indians, chiefly in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In 1633 they were succeeded by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, who made their headquarters at Port Royal (Annapolis), <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, and had stations as far south as the Kennebec, the principal one being among the Penobscot, near the French Fort Pentagouet (Castine), at the mouth of the Penobscot. In 1655 the post was seized by the English, and the resident missionary, Father De Crespy, carried off. Although restored to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by treaty in 1667, the mission languished, and in 1693 was consigned to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who made the new mission of Sainte Anne (established by Father Louis Thury in 1684 higher up the river, near the present Oldtown) their chief residence among the Penobscot. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> had laboured also among the Etchemin (see <a href="../cathen/09570a.htm">MALISEET INDIANS</a>) on the northern frontier of <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, their chief station being at Medoctec on the Saint John, established by Father Sim&eacute;on in 1688 and revived by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1701. In 1646 the noted <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/05164a.htm">Gabriel Druillettes</a>, was sent from Quebec, and established at Norridgewock (Indian Old Point) on the Kennebec the Assumption mission, which for nearly eighty years thereafter held its place as the principal of the Abenaki missions. The most noted worker at this post was <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Sebastian Rasle</a> (R&acirc;le, Rasles), who laboured with the utmost <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> from 1695 until his heroic death in 1724 at the age of sixty-six.

<p>The chronic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> throughout all this period between the rival French and English colonies, in which the native tribes almost solidly took the side of the French, exposed the Indian missions to the constant attacks of the English and made the missionaries marked men, both as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and as supposed agents of the French Government. In consequence many fugitives from the Abenaki bands retired to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where they were joined by refugees from the Pennacook and other southern New England tribes, driven out by King Philip's War of 1675-76. In 1683 these were gathered by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Jacques Bigot, into the new mission of Saint Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales (St. Francis) on the Chadi&egrave;re, near Quebec. In 1700 the mission was removed to its present location. In spite of repeated demands by the New England Government (1698, 1701, 1712), the Abenaki refused either to send their missionaries away or to accept <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> teachers. Realising the danger, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> urged that the Abenaki Indians and missions be removed to a safer location in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, but the project was not favoured by the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Government. In 1704-5 two New England expeditions ravaged the Abenaki, burning Norridgewock, with its church, and looting the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>. In 1713 some Indians removed to the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> and settled at B&eacute;cancour, where their descendants still remain. Norridgewock was rebuilt, and in 1722 was again destroyed by the New England men. As part of the plunder the raiders carried off the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Abenaki dictionary (preserved at Harvard and published in 1833), to which <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Father Rasle</a> had devoted thirty years of labour, and which ranks as one of the greatest monuments of our Aboriginal languages. Earlier in the year the mission village and fine church on the Penobscot, placed under Father Lauverjat, had been destroyed by another party, following which event <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> had summoned the Indians to deliver up every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> among them and had set a price on <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Rasle's</a> head. Although repeatedly urged to seek safety in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, he refused to <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> his flock. At last the blow fell. On 23 August 1724, the New England men with a party of Mohawk Indians surprised Norridgewock while most of the warriors were away, killed several or the defenders, and plundered and burned the church and village. The devoted missionary, now old and crippled, was shot down at the foot of the cross, scalped, his skull crushed and his body almost hacked in pieces. A monument to his memory was erected on the spot in 1833, the year in which the greater monument, his Abenaki dictionary, was published.

<p>Mission work was continued in some measure, although under difficulties, among the Indians of the Penobscot and the St. John, but most of the Norridgewock band retired to Saint Francis, which thus became one of the most flourishing missions in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. In 1759 it was attacked by a strong New England force under Colonel Rogers and completely destroyed, with its church and records, two hundred Indians being killed. The mission was re-established near the present Pierreville, Quebec, and still exists, numbering about 350 mixed bloods, while B&eacute;cancour has about 50 more. The Abenaki bands which remained in Maine espoused the cause of the Americans in the Revolution, and in 1775 made application to the new Government for the return of their <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> commissioners, although willing, were unable to supply them, but a later application to Bishop Carroll resulted in the appointment of the Sulpician Father, Fran&ccedil;ois Ciquard, to the Penobscot at Oldtown about 1785 For nearly ten years he ministered to them and the Passamaquoddy, when he was transferred to the Maliseet on the Saint John. After various changes the Maine missions reverted again to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258a.htm">Father John Bapst</a>, who arrived at Oldtown in 1848. The most distinguished of the later missionaries is Eugene Vetromile, S.J. (d.1881), author of several works on the Abenaki tribe and language. The two tribes are entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>.
<h2 id="section3">New York and Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>A large part of what is now New York State was held by the five confederated tribes of the fierce and powerful <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, numbering nearly two thousand fighting men. Through the unfortunate circumstances of <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain's</a> allying himself with a party of their enemies in 1609, they conceived a bitter hostility to the French which they gratified with deadly effect after procuring guns from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> thirty years later. For this reason, and from the additional fact that their territory was within the sphere of English influence, no permanent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission was ever established within their limits, although several attempts were made, and large numbers were drawn off from the confederacy and formed into mission settlements under French control. So far as is known, the first missionary to enter this region was the Recollect father, <a href="../cathen/09004c.htm">Joseph de la Roche de Daillon</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> mission in <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, who in 1626 made a perilous exploration of the country of the Neuter Nation, adjoining the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> in western New York. In 1642 the heroic <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Isaac Jogues</a>, was captured with two white companions and several <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> by an <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> party and taken to the Mohawk town of <a href="../cathen/03458a.htm">Caughnawaga</a> (alias Ossernenon) near the present <a href="../cathen/02111b.htm">Auriesville</a>, were the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> were burned at the stake, and the three <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> cruelly tortured and mutilated, though not <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Father Jogues</a> had his nails torn out, two fingers crushed by the teeth of the savages, and one thumb sawn off. One of his companions, the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> <a href="../cathen/06684a.htm">Rene Goupil</a>, was killed shortly afterwards for making the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> over a sick child. The third <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a>, Couture, was finally adopted. After a terrible captivity of fifteen months during which he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> many <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> at the stake as well as dying infants, besides acquiring a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the language, <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Father Jogues</a> was rescued by the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> and finally found his way to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In the meantime another <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> missionary, <a href="../cathen/02766a.htm">Father Joseph Bressani</a>, had been captured by the same Mohawks, tortured in even more terrible fashion at the same town, and likewise ransomed through the kindness of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> (1644). In the summer of 1644 <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Father Jogues</a> was back again in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, assisting in negotiating an uncertain peace with the Mohawks. In May, 1646, he was sent with a single white companion to the Mohawk country to consummate the agreement. This done, he returned to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to make his report, and then, with another <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a> and a <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> guide, set out once more for the Mohawk to establish a mission. They were intercepted on the way by a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> party of the same perfidious Mohawks, and carried to <a href="../cathen/03458a.htm">Caughnawaga</a>, where, after various cruelties, all three were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> on 18 October, 1646, the head of <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Father Jogues</a> being set upon the palisades of the town, and his body thrown into the Mohawk River. The site of the Indian town is now the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and a memorial <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> marks the spot of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.

<p>In August, 1653, <a href="../cathen/12228b.htm">Father Joseph Poncet, S.J.</a>, was captured near <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> by a Mohawk <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> party, carried to their towns, and there terribly tortured, but finally sent back with overtures of peace. Of the five confederated <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> tribes, the Onondaga, Oneida and Cayuga were also now for peace with the French and only the Seneca (who, however, nearly equalled all the others together) held back. <a href="../cathen/12228b.htm">Father Poncet</a> reached <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> late in the year, and peace was made. <a href="../cathen/09149a.htm">Father Simon Le Moyne, S.J.</a>, volunteered to go back to ratify the terms in the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> towns, and arrived in the summer of 1654 at Onondaga, their capital, where he successfully effected his purpose and was invited to select a spot for a French settlement. As a result the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> <a href="../cathen/03645a.htm">Joseph Chaumonot</a> and <a href="../cathen/04601a.htm">Claude Dablon</a> established the first <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> mission at Onondaga in November, 1654. In all the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> tribes there were numerous <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> captives (see <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">HURON INDIANS</a>), who gave the missionaries a warm welcome. In 1656 <a href="../cathen/09149a.htm">Father Le Moyne</a> was again with the Mohawks. In July, 1655, a party of fifty French colonists with several more <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> arrived at Onondaga to found a settlement there, as requested by the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, although it was strongly felt that the latter were insincere and meditated treachery. Mission stations were established in each of the tribes, but almost before a year had passed the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> raids along the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> broke out afresh, and in March, 1658, the mission at Onondaga was abandoned.

<p>Besides the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> and other Indian captives, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> still had many friends among the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> themselves, foremost of all being Garaconthi&eacute;, the Onondaga chief and orator. Through his influence the Onondaga and Cayuga sought for peace in 1661, and <a href="../cathen/09149a.htm">Le Moyne</a> was recalled to Onondaga. In 1666 an expedition under De Courcelles completely humbled the Mohawks. In the same year New York and the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> country passed from <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> to English control. Following the peace six <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a> (<a href="../cathen/06271a.htm">Jacques Fremin</a>, <a href="../cathen/12080a.htm">Jean Pierron</a>, <a href="../cathen/03024b.htm">Jacques Bruyas</a>, <a href="../cathen/06389a.htm">Julien Garnier</a>, <a href="../cathen/03347a.htm">Etienne de Carheil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10312a.htm">Pierre Milet</a>) proceeded to the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, and, before the end of 1668, regular missions were established in each the five tribes. Garaconthi&eacute; publicly declared himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and his example was followed by several other chiefs. As converts increased it was realized that the prevailing intemperance and debauchery consequent upon the presence of traders the Indian towns were a serious obstacle to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and many of the better-disposed removed to the neighbourhood of the mission settlements in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. In this way originated in 1668 the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> mission village of La Prairie (St. Fran&ccedil;ois Xavier des Pr&eacute;s), the precursor of the modern Caughnawaga. Among the names prominently identified with the mission are those of Fathers <a href="../cathen/03024b.htm">Bruyas</a> and <a href="../cathen/09650a.htm">Marcoux</a>, <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> philologists; <a href="../cathen/08739a.htm">Father Lafitau</a>, ethnologist and historian; and the sainted Indian girl, Catherine Tegakwitha. In the same year a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician mission was established among some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, chiefly Cayuga, Quint&eacute; Bay at Lake Ontario; but after a few years it was absorbed by the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> mission of The Mountain, established in 1676 on the island of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> by the Sulpicians. This mission was transferred in 1704 to the Sault au Recollet, north of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and in 1720 to its present site at Lake of Two Mountains (alias Oka, or Canasadaga), on the island of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, a number of <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> sharing the village. Among the missionaries was <a href="../cathen/04569c.htm">Father Jean-Andr&eacute; Cuoq</a>, author of a number of works in the two languages, the most notable of which is a standard <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> dictionary.

<p>With the withdrawal of the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> element to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and the renewal of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in 1687 all missionary effort in the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> territory was finally abandoned, although <a href="../cathen/10312a.htm">Father Milet</a> continued with the Oneida until 1694. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1687-99 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> missions fought beside the French against their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> kindred of the confederacy.

<p>At the request of the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> a mission was re-established at Onondaga and another among the Senecas in 1702 by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a>, Jacques de Lamberville, <a href="../cathen/06389a.htm">Julien Garnier</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15249b.htm">Vaillant du Gueslis</a>, and had the effect of holding the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> neutral in the next <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, until broken up by the New York Government in 1709. In 1748 the Sulpician father, <a href="../cathen/12075d.htm">Fran&ccedil;ois Picquet</a>, established the Presentation mission on the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> near the French post of Oswegatchie, now Ogdensburg, New York, with the design of drawing off the last remaining <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indians from among the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>. Although raided by the Mohawks in the next year, it was at once rebuilt and grew rapidly until the opening of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1754-63, which brought it to the verge of ruin, most of those who remained joining with others from the Caughnawaga mission (Canada) in 1756 to establish a new settlement under <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> auspices at Aquasasne, <em>alias</em> St. Fran&ccedil;ois R&eacute;gis, which still exists under the name of St. Regis, on both sides of the New York-Canada boundary where it strikes the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>. The Oswegatchie settlement was finally abandoned in 1807. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> now number about 4025 out of a total 18,725, Caughnawaga itself with 2175 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> being the largest Indian settlement north of Mexico.

<p>About 1755 the first mission in western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> was started among the Delawares at Sawcunk, on Beaver River, where also were some Shawnee and Mingo (detached <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>), by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Claude Fran&ccedil;ois Virot, but was soon discontinued.
<h2 id="section4">Ohio River and Lake region</h2>

<p>Under this head we include the states carved out in whole or part from the old "Northwestern Territory", viz., <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, and Minnesota. As the mission history of this section is treated in detail under the principal tribal titles, we may confine ourselves here to a brief summary. Excepting southern Illinois and <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, all of this vast territory was originally included within the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and up to the close of the French period in 1763 was confided generally to the spiritual charge of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who continued in the work into the American period. The first mission west of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> country was established in 1660, on Keweenaw Bay, a few miles north of the present L&#8217;Anse, Upper Michigan, by the veteran <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> missionary, Father Ren&eacute; Menard, in response to urgent requests from the <a href="../cathen/03690a.htm">Chippewas</a> and Ottawas. The next year a call came from some fugitive <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, who had fled to Green Bay in <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, to escape the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>. To the remonstrance of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the dangers of the way he replied "God calls me. I must go, if it cost me my life." In making a dangerous portage he became separated from his guides and was never seen again, but as the searchers came upon a hostile trail, and his <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and cassock were afterwards found with the <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux</a>, it is believed that he was killed by a lurking enemy. His place was filled by <a href="../cathen/01326b.htm">Father Claude Allouez</a>, who, as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in the West, established the second <a href="../cathen/03690a.htm">Chippewa</a> mission in 1665, under the name of Saint Esprit at La Pointe Chegoinegon, now Bayfield, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, on the south shore of Lake Superior. Other missions soon followed at <a href="../cathen/13487a.htm">Sault Sainte Marie</a> (Sainte Marie) and Mackinaw (St. Ignace) in Upper Michigan; Green Bay (St. Fran&ccedil;ois Xavier), St. Marc, and St Jacques in <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, among <a href="../cathen/03690a.htm">Chippewas</a>, Ottawas, <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, Mascoutens, Kickapoos, Foxes, and Miami. Among the noted <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> workers were Fathers <a href="../cathen/04601a.htm">Claude Dablon</a>, <a href="../cathen/05164a.htm">Gabriel Druillettes</a>, and the explorer Jacques Marquette. In 1688 the mission of St. Joseph was founded by <a href="../cathen/01326b.htm">Allouez</a> among the <a href="../cathen/12320a.htm">Potawatomi</a> in northern <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>. The mission at Lapointe was abandoned in 1671 on account of the hostile <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux</a>, but most of the others continued, with interruption; down to the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1764. In 1727 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit father</a>, Louis Guignas, founded the mission of St Michael among the <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux</a>, on Lake Pepin in <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, which continued until some time after 1736, being abandoned probably on account of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Foxes.

<p>The first mission among the Illinois was that of the Immaculate Conception, founded by Marquette in 1674 near the present Rockford, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and known later as the Kaskaskia mission. Others were established later at Peoria Lake and at Cahokia, opposite St. Louis, until by 1725 the entire Illinois nation was enrolled as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> names prominently connected with the Illinois missions are those of Marquette, <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Rasle</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06732b.htm">Jacques Gravier</a>, author of the great <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Illinois dictionary.

<p>Missions were also established later among the various branches of the Miami in <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> as well as among the <a href="../cathen/12320a.htm">Potawatomi</a>, which continued to flourish until the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of expulsion, when the mission <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was confiscated, although the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> generally remained as <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> until their death. Their successors continued to minister to Indians and whites alike till the removal of the tribes, 1820-40.

<p>The majority of the Indians of Michigan and <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a> remained in their own homes, with missions maintained either as regular establishments or as visiting stations served by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. Of the later missionaries one of the distinguished names is that of the author and philologist <a href="../cathen/02282b.htm">Bishop Frederick Baraga</a> (d. 1865), best known for his grammar and dictionary of the <a href="../cathen/03690a.htm">Chippewa</a> language.

<h2 id="section5">Lower Mississippi region: the Louisiana mission</h2>

<p>The "Louisiana Mission" of the French colonial period included the present States of Missouri, <a href="../cathen/01724a.htm">Arkansas</a>, <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">Mississippi</a>, and Alabama, with the Tamarois foundation near Cahokia in <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, but excluding the Caddo establishments on the disputed Spanish frontier of <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. For several reasons, rivalries and changes among the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, intrigues of English traders, and general neglect or open hostility of the Louisiana colonial administration, these southern missions never attained any large measure of prosperity or permanent success. In 1673 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Marquette had descended the Mississippi as far as the villages of the Arkansas, later known as Quapaw, at the mouth of the river of the same name, making the earliest map of the region and indicating the position of the various tribes, but without undertaking a foundation.

<p>In 1682 the Recollect <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10172b.htm">Father Zenobius Membr&eacute;</a>, with the party of the commander La Salle, descended the Mississippi to its mouth and returned, planting a cross among the Arkansas, and preaching to them and to the Taensa, Natches, end others farther down. In 1683 a French fort was built at the Arkansas, and the commander Tonty set apart a mission site and made formal request for a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, but apparently without result. In 1698, under authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec, an offshoot of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Congregation of Foreign Missions, undertook the lower Mississippi field despite the protests of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who considered it partly at least within their own sphere. Early in 1699, three <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having arrived, as many missions were established, viz., among the Tamaroa (Tamarois), a tribe of the Illinois confederacy, at Cahokia, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, by Father Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois de St-Cosme; among the Taensa, above the present Natchez, <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">Mississippi</a>, by Fran&ccedil;ois-J. de Montigny; and among the Tonica, at the present Fort Adams, <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">Mississippi</a>, by Father Antoine* Davion. Father de Montigny shortly afterwards transferred his mission to the kindred and more important Natchez tribe, about the present city of that name, ministering thus to both tribes. Father Davion laboured also with the <a href="../cathen/15732d.htm">Yazoo</a> and minor tribes on that river. Other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> arrived later. In the meantime Iberville, the father of the Louisiana colony, had brought out from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1700) the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit father</a>, Paul du Ru, who, first at Biloxi, <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">Mississippi</a>, and later at <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, <a href="../cathen/01240a.htm">Alabama</a>, ministered to the small tribes gathered about the French post, including a band of fugitive Apalachee from the revived Florida mission. In the same year another <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father Joseph de Limoges, from <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, planted a mission among the Huma and Bayagula, Choctaw bands about the mouth of the Red River, Louisiana.

<p>In 1702 Father Nicholas Foucault, of the Seminarists, who had established a mission among the Arkansas two years before, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>, with three companions, by the savage Koroa of Upper Mississippi while on his way to Mobile. Their remains were found and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> by Father Davion. In 1706 Father St-Cosme, then stationed at the Natchez mission, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the Shetimasha, near the mouth of the Mississippi, while asleep in a night camp.

<p>The Tonica station was abandoned in 1708, being threatened by the Chickasaw in the English interest. The whole southern work languished, the Indians themselves being either indifferent or openly hostile to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and when Father Charlevoix made his western tour in 1721 he found but one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on the lower Mississippi, Father Juif, among the <a href="../cathen/15732d.htm">Yazoo</a>. Partly in consequence of Father Charlevoix's report, the Louisiana Company, which had taken over control of the colony, gave permission to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to under take the Indian work, while the French posts and settlements were assigned to other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In 1726, therefore, Father Paul du Poisson restored the Arkansas mission, which had been vacant since 1702; Father Alexis de Guyenne undertook the Alibamon, a tribe of the Creek nation, above Mobile, and Father Mathurin le Petit began work among the Choctaw in southern Mississippi. The <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> foundation at <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> in 1727 is due to <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> effort. In the a next year the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit father</a>, <a href="../cathen/02351b.htm">Michel Baudouin</a>, undertook a mission among the warlike Chickasaw.

<p>In 1729 the southern missions were almost ruined by the outbreak of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Natchez, provoked by the arbitrary exactions of the French commandant in their country. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> began on 28 November with a massacre of the French garrison, the first victim being Father du Poisson, who was struck down, and his head hacked off, while on his way to attend a dying man. Father Souel was killed on 11 December by the <a href="../cathen/15732d.htm">Yazoo</a>, who then turned upon the French garrison in their country. On New Year&#8217;s Day, 1730, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> <a href="../cathen/05144a.htm">Doutreleau</a>, on his way down the river with some boatmen, was fired upon at close range by some of the same tribe while saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> on shore, but escaped although badly wounded. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> involved the whole lower Mississippi, and ended in the extinction of the Natchez as a people. A part of the refugees having fled to the Chickasaw, a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> ensued with that tribe in 1736, during which a French expedition was cut to pieces, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, Father Antoninus Senat, was burnt at the stake.

<p>In 1730 Father Gaston, a newly-arrived Seminarist, had been killed at the Tamarois (Cahokia) mission. In 1754 the last Seminarist was sent out as a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The Arkansas mission had been killed by official neglect. The missionary among the Alibamon Greeks was driven out by the French commander at Fort <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (Montgomery, Alabama) for his opposition to the liquor traffic. <a href="../cathen/02351b.htm">Father Baudouin</a> continued with good effect among the Choctaw for eighteen years until appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in 1757, when his place was filled by Father Nicholas le Febvre until 1764 (?). The Alibamon mission was restored and continued under Father Jean Le Pr&eacute;dour from 1754 until the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1764, which brought the "Louisiana Mission" to a close. The Natchez and <a href="../cathen/15732d.htm">Yazoo</a> are long since extinct, but a considerable portion of the Choctaw, Quapaw, and mixed-blood Huma still keep the Faith.

<h2 id="section6">Northern and central plains</h2>

<p>The earliest labourer here was the Franciscan Father <a href="../cathen/11385a.htm">Juan de Padilla</a>, who with four others of his order accompanied the famous expedition of <a href="../cathen/04379e.htm">Coronado</a> in 1540-42, and on the return volunteered to remain behind with the Wichita in the "Province of Quivira", probably in southern Kansas. He was killed soon afterwards, apparently by Indians hostile to the Wichita. The latter, reduced to about 300 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, are represented at the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Anadarko, Oklahoma (see <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">WICHITA</a>).

<p>The powerful <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux</a>, or Dakota whose territory stretched from the <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a> border almost to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, were visited by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Alouez as early as 1666, but tribal jealousies interrupted friendly communication and prevented any mission establishment. In 1680 the Recollect <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Father Louis Hennepin</a>, spent some months with them as a captive on the upper Mississippi. In 1690 (?) the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Joseph Marest, and in 1728 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Ignatius Guignas, made unsuccessful mission attempts in the tribe, and in 1736 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Jean-Pierre Aulneau (or Amand) was one of a party of twenty-one <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> massacred by them on the Lake of the Woods, just beyond the northern Minnesota boundary. In 1837 a regular mission was established among the eastern <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux</a> in Minnesota by Father Augustin Ravoux, and in 1848 the noted <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Father de Smet</a> first preached to those west of the Missouri. Nearly one-fourth of the tribe is now <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">SIOUX INDIANS</a>).

<p>The famous Flathead mission in <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>, established by <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Father de Smet</a> in 1840, the Osage mission, <a href="../cathen/11230c.htm">Oklahoma</a>, regularly established about 1847 by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> Schoenmaker and Bax, the Kiowa and Quapaw missions, and those among the immigrant Choctaw, <a href="../cathen/12320a.htm">Potawatomi</a>, and Miami, also in <a href="../cathen/11230c.htm">Oklahoma</a>, those of the Winnebago in <a href="../cathen/10729b.htm">Nebraska</a> and the Mandan and associated tribes in <a href="../cathen/11111b.htm">North Dakota</a> are all described elsewhere under the tribal titles. Besides these, successful mission <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> have been established within the past thirty years, and are now in operation, among the Northern Cheyenne (secular), Assiniboin (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>), Crow (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>), Grosventre (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>), and Piegan Blackfeet (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>) in <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>; the Arapaho and Shoshoni (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>) in <a href="../cathen/15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>; and the Southern Ute (Theatine) in <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a> (see UTE INDIANS).
<h2 id="section7">Texas, etc.</h2>

<p>Texas as a Spanish colony was connected with Mexico, and was ruled in missionary affairs from <a href="../cathen/12601b.htm">Quer&eacute;taro</a> and <a href="../cathen/15740a.htm">Zacatecas</a>, instead of from <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>, as was Florida. Its immense area, four times as great as that of all New England, contained hundreds of petty tribes or bands &#8211; so many, in fact, that they have never been counted &#8211; speaking scores of languages or dialects, but mostly grouped into a few loose confederacies, based upon linguistic affiliation, of which the principal within the mission sphere may be designated as the Caddo, Hasinai, Karankawa, Tonkawa, <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">Wichita</a>, and Pakaw&aacute;. Of these, the Caddo group extended into western Louisiana, while the tribes of the Wichita connexion ranged north into <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>. The total Indian population within the present State limits was probably originally close to 40,000. The beginning of mission work in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> was made by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Father Andr&eacute;s de Olmos, who in 1544 crossed the Rio Grande and, after gathering a large body of converts, led them back into <a href="../cathen/14440c.htm">Tamaulipas</a>, where they were organised into a mission town, Olives. In 1685 the French commander La Salle erected a fort on Matagorda Bay, and two years later, after a succession of misfortunes, started to make his way overland to <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, leaving behind about twenty men, including the Recollect missionaries, Fathers <a href="../cathen/10172b.htm">Zenobius Membr&eacute;</a> and Maximus Le Clercq, and the Sulpician Father Chefdeville. A Spanish expedition which arrived later to dispossess the French found only blackened ruins and unburied bones. All but two men had been killed by the Indians, among whom the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a> and Breviaries of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were afterwards recovered.

<p>In 1690 a company of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> from the Quer&eacute;taro College, headed by Father Damian Mazanet, established a mission among the friendly Hasinai (Asinais, Cenis), in north-east <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, and projected others, but the work was abandoned three years later. In 1699 the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15740a.htm">Zacatecas</a> College began a series of missions along the south bank of the Rio Grande, to which they gathered in a number of Indians of the Pakaw&aacute; group in southern <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. These were kept up until 1718, when the chief mission was transferred to San Antonio in <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>.

<p>In 1715 the two colleges combined to restore the <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> missions, urged by the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the venerable founder of the <a href="../cathen/15740a.htm">Zacatecas</a> college, <a href="../cathen/09657b.htm">Father Antonio Margil</a>. The Hasinai mission (San Francisco) was restored and another, La Pur&iacute;sima, established among the cognate Hainai (Aynais) in the neighbourhood of the present Nacogdoches. Another (N. S. de Guadalupe) was founded by <a href="../cathen/09657b.htm">Margil</a> himself among the Nacogdoches band of the Caddo in 1716, and others in 1717 among the Ais (N. S. de Dolores) and Adai or Adayes (San Miguel de Linares), the last being within the limits of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. In 1719, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> having been declared between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, a French expedition under St-Denis plundered the mission at the Adai. In consequence the missions were abandoned until peace was declared two years later.

<p>In 1718 the mission of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> Solano was transferred to San Antonio de Valero. Other missions were established in the vicinity, making a total of four in 1731, including San Antonio de Padua, the celebrated Alamo. The principal tribes represented were Caddo and Hasinai from the East; Xarame from the Rio Grande; Pakaw&aacute; (Pacoa) and a few To&#324;kawa of the immediate neighbourhood. In the meantime a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> had perished in a prairie fire, and another, Brother Jos&eacute; Pita, in 1721, with a small party, had been massacred by the Lipan while on his way to his station. In 1722 the mission of Guadalupe was established at <a href="../cathen/13466a.htm">Bahia</a>, on Lavaca (Matagorda) Bay among the Karankawa. Nine years later it was moved to the Guadalupe River. In 1752 the Candelaria mission was attacked by the Coco, a Karankawa band, and Father Jos&eacute; Ganzabal killed. In 1757 the mission of San Sab&aacute; was established by Father Alonso Terreros for the conversion of the wild and nomadic Lipan <a href="../cathen/01592a.htm">Apache</a>, but they refused to settle in it; the following year the tribes destroyed the mission, killing Father Terreros and two other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Another attempted Lipan mission in 1761, was broken up in 1769 by the Comanche. At this period the <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> missions had reached their highest point, with an Indian population of about 15,000. In 1760 Father Bartolom&eacute; Garc&iacute;a published his religious manual for the use of the San Antonio missions, which remains almost our only linguistic monument of the Pakaw&aacute; tribes of central <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. In 1791 another mission was established among the Karankawa.

<p>Although constantly hampered by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> authorities, the missions continued to exist until 1812, when they were suppressed by the revolutionary Government, and the Indians scattered (see PAKAW&Aacute; INDIANS; <a href="../cathen/14778a.htm">TONKAWA INDIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">WICHITA</a>).
<h2 id="section8">New Mexico and Arizona</h2>

<p>The earliest exploration in this territory was made by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Marco de Niza (Marcos of Nizza) in 1539, and the first missions were undertaken in 1542 by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> who accompanied <a href="../cathen/04379e.htm">Coronado</a>. (For the missions among the Pueblo and Hopi see <a href="../cathen/12554b.htm">PUEBLO INDIANS</a>.) The most important event in this connexion is the great Pueblo revolt of 1680 in which twenty-one missionaries and some 400 others were massacred.

<p>The missions among the Pima and Papajo of Arizona are of later foundation, beginning about 1732, and originated with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, with whom they continued until the expulsion of the order in 1767, when they were taken over by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (see PAPAJO INDIANS; <a href="../cathen/12100a.htm">PIMA INDIANS</a>).

<p>Attempts to evangelise the powerful tribe of the <a href="../cathen/10720a.htm">Navajo</a> in northern Arizona and <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> were made by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> as early as 1746, but without result. Lately the work has been again taken up successfully by German <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. To their scholarship and scientific interest we owe also a monumental "Ethnological Dictionary of the <a href="../cathen/10720a.htm">Navaho</a> Language". (See <a href="../cathen/10720a.htm">NAVAJO INDIANS</a>.) Secular mission work is also now conducted in the Mescalero tribe of about 450 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> at Tularosa, <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>.
<h2 id="section9">The Columbia region</h2>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> among the tribes of this region came through the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> French employees of the Hudson Bay Company, by whose influence and teaching many of the Indians, particularly among the Flatheads and Nez Perc&eacute;s, were induced to embrace the principles and practices of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> as early as 1820, leading some years later to a request for missionaries, in response to which the Flathead mission in <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a> was founded by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> <a href="../cathen/04752a.htm">Peter de Smet</a> in 1841, followed shortly afterwards by another among the C&#339;ur d&#8217;Al&ecirc;ne in <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a>, established by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Nicholas Point. In 1839 <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Father Francis Blanchet</a>, secular, who had come out to attend the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> residents, established <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> mission on the Cowlitz, in western Washington, and another on the lower Willamet at Champoeg, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, while about the same time Father J.B. Boldue began work among the tribes on Puget Sound. In 1844 three <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions were established among the Pend d&#8217;Oreilles and Colvilles of the Upper Columbia, besides three others across the British line. In 1847 the Oblates arrived, and missions were established by Father Pandosy among the Yakima and by Father Ricard near the present Olympia. In 1848 the secular Fathers Rousseau and Mespl&eacute;e founded a station among the Wasco, at the Dalles of the Columbia, in <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>. Work was also attempted among the degenerate Chinooks, with little result. The noted Oblate missionary, Father Casimir Chirouse (d. 1892), best known for his later work at Tulalip, reached <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> in 1847 and began his labours among the tribes of Puget Sound and the lower Columbia about the same period.

<p>With the exception of the Wasco and the Chinooks, these missions or their successors are still in successful operation, numbering among their adherents the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indians of Washington and southern <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a>. To Fathers Saintonge and Pandosy we are indebted for important contributions to Yakima linguistics. (See <a href="../cathen/03688a.htm">CHINOOKS</a>; <a href="../cathen/08594a.htm">KALISPEL INDIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/08711a.htm">KUTENAI INDIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/08751a.htm">LAKE INDIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/09431a.htm">LUMMI INDIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/12586a.htm">PUYALLUP INDIANS</a>; <a href="../cathen/14232a.htm">SPOKAN INDIANS</a>; TULALIP INDIANS; <a href="../cathen/15732a.htm">YAKIMA INDIANS</a>.)

<p>Besides these there are <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions of more recent establishment among the Nez Perc&eacute;s of <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a>; and among the Umatilla, Klamath, Warmspring, and Siletz Indians in <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, besides another among the remnant tribes of Grand Ronde reservation, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, served by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Society of the Divine Saviour.

<h2 id="section11">The missionary martyrs</h2>

<p>The following incomplete and tentative list of missionaries who died by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> or other untimely death in direct connexion with their work will show that even before the establishment of the republic the soil of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptised</a> in the blood of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries from ocean to ocean. A few other names are included for special reasons. Those who perished with the exploring expeditions under Narv&aacute;ez, De Soto, and others are not noted.
