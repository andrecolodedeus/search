<h1>Catholic Missionary Union</h1>  

<p>The corporate name of a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> whose directors are chosen from among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and the missionary organizations of that country, its purpose being to engage <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and lay-men as missionaries to non-Catholics in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to provide for their maintenance, to distribute <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature, and in every way to assist the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in establishing and carrying on home missions in their various jurisdictions. It was formed by the <a href="../cathen/10368c.htm">Paulist Fathers</a> in carrying out the vocation of their founder, <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Isaac Thomas Hecker</a>, i.e. the conversion of non-Catholics in America.

<p>This movement recognizes and helps to meet the responsibility of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people for the spiritual welfare of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> non-Catholics, as being even sacramentally part of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christ's fold</a>; and of all others, as called by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be saved and brought to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> ministrations. Thus, instead of ignoring the religious condition of their non-Catholic countrymen, all classes of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> will be aided by this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> striving to convert them. Among the practical efforts of this movement is the forming in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of bands of missionaries composed of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> acting under their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. These assemble non-Catholics wherever possible and explain to them the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The mode of explanation is more expository than controversial. Through a "question box" queries are invited concerning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> teaching, and through carefully prepared lectures and the widespread dissemination of literature misunderstandings are dispelled and an attractive presentation of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> provided.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Missionary Union owns the Apostolic Mission House, the training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the missionaries, located at the Catholic University, Washington, D.C., and dedicated in April, 1904. It provides a normal course of instruction for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are desirous of devoting themselves to the conversion of non-Catholics in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> mission-bands, or even in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> ministry. The following <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are now provided with these apostolates, as the missionary bands are called: Providence, <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, New York, <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>, <a href="../cathen/04462b.htm">Covington</a>, <a href="../cathen/11661b.htm">Peoria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/14016b.htm">Sioux Falls</a>, <a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Fort Wayne</a>, <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/11108a.htm">North Carolina</a>, <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, and Oklahoma, numbering together 51 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. There are six other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> assisting at missions in these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in preparation for forming apostolates in their own <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, namely in <a href="../cathen/14236c.htm">Springfield</a>, <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15658b.htm">Winona</a>. Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are making their courses of study in the Apostolic Mission House for Ogdensburg, <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Erie</a>, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">Alton</a>, <a href="../cathen/02213b.htm">Baker City</a>, <a href="../cathen/11661b.htm">Peoria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/14016a.htm">Sioux City</a>, St. Augustine, and <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, together with several members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, some domiciled, and others attending classes giving missions, or preparing to do so, there is now a total of 82 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. For the more necessitous <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> not only are the missionaries trained without any expense to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but financial support is furnished them after they begin their work. During a decade of years the missionaries in the movement that centres about the Apostolic Mission House have given 1008 missions to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>,1468 missions to non-Catholics, and received many converts into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, besides placing many more under instruction to be received later by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It is not possible to give precise statistics, but it is sure that conversions have been stimulated by these missionary activities. During the year 1906 it is computed that about 25,000 converts were received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> by various missionary agencies.

<p>An important feature of the missions is the free distribution of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature. The books are given into the hands of non-Catholics by the missionaries themselves standing before the altar after the public services, it being expressly stated that they are accepted to be read. In this way a great deal more than a million of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> books have passed into non-Catholic hands during the last ten or twelve years. These are Cardinal Gibbons' "Faith of Our Fathers", Searle's "Plain Facts", Conway's "Question Box", <a href="../cathen/05740a.htm">Faa Di Bruno's</a> "Catholic Belief", Xavier Sutton's "Clearing the Way", and others; not counting a very great number of catechisms, Mass-books, pamphlets, and leaflets.

<p>A public convention of missionaries to non-Catholics is assembled by the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> every two or three years. The delegates discuss fully the religious conditions in America and the prospects of converting the people to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Carefully prepared papers are read, and addresses delivered, and their topics debated, all looking to the choice of means and methods for increasing the number of converts. The proceedings of each convention are published in book form and circulated very extensively with remarkably good results. It is noteworthy that at the latest convention (June, 1905) the principal <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were present by their representatives. The Mission Union depends wholly on charity for funds to support its work. The principal medium of collection is its monthly magazine "The Missionary" which, by edifying <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with authentic accounts of the results of the propaganda, stimulates their charitable offerings. The whole movement has from the beginning enjoyed the fullest approval of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and has received the express commendation of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.
