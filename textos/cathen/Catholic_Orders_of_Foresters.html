<h1>Catholic Orders of Foresters</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>On 30 July, 1879, some members of the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.</a>, desiring to have a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> fraternal insurance <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, organized one on the plan of the Foresters' courts and called it the <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Order of Foresters. It was so chartered, and its membership was confined to the <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">State of Massachusetts</a>, except in one instance, where a court was formed at <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, <a href="../cathen/13020a.htm">Rhode Island</a>. On 1 January, 1909, the official report stated that there were 235 courts organized, with a membership of 27,757. Of the members 9679 were <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The insurance in force on 31 Dec., 1908, was $27,757,000.
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>On 24 May, 1883, a number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, taking up the plan of this <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, organized on the same lines the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Order of Foresters of Illinois. A flat all-around death assessment of one dollar was adopted, and men of all ages were admitted to membership at the same rate. Later, when courts were established in a number of other States and in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, an international convention in 1895 adopted a graded system of assessment insurance. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> between eighteen and forty-five years of age are eligible for membership. From the date of organization to 1 June, 1908, it paid out $10,639,936 for death claims, and $2,500,000 in funeral and sick benefits. It had in April, 1909, 1600 courts and a membership of 136,212 distributed over twenty-six States and the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Dominion of Canada</a>. The main offices are at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, Illinois. The official organ, "The Catholic Forester", is published at <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>. The word <em>Illinois</em> in the original title of the organization was dropped in 1888, as the membership had then extended beyond the limits of that State. This <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is not affiliated with the <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Order of Foresters.
<h2 id="section3">III</h2>

<p>A Women's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Order of Foresters was organized in 1892 at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, having for its object benevolent co-operation among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with assessment life-insurance at low rates. It has a membership of 54,350, with courts scattered over many of the States. The main offices are at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>.
