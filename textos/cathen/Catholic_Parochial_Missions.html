<h1>Catholic Parochial Missions</h1>  

<p>This term is used to designate certain special exertions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> pastoral agencies, made, for the most part, among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, to instruct them more fully in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of their religion, to convert sinners, rouse the torpid and indifferent, and lift the good to a still higher plane of spiritual effort. To distinguish them from those missions which represent the apostolic activity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, these home missions are known in some communities of English-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as "parochial missions". Such missions usually consist of a systematic course of preaching and instruction, extending over a stated number of days, performed by authorized missionaries. The present article treats of: <ul><li>I. The Necessity and Utility of Popular Missions; <li>II. Origin and History; <li>III. Method.</ul>
<h2 id="section1">Necessity and utility</h2>

<p>From the above definition it is evident that the primary object of a popular mission is not the making of converts to the Faith. However, owing to the familiar relations between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> this is so common a result that it may be regarded as normally a part of the work in that country, and, beginning from the last decade of the nineteenth century, an organized missionary movement for the conversion of non-Catholics has been carried on throughout that country. (See <a href="../cathen/10368c.htm">MISSIONARY SOCIETY OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE</a>.) But the converts whom a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> most of all seeks during a regular <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> mission are among his own people. And it cannot be denied that the clear, forcible, and consecutive exposition of the most important <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, together with a course of instructions to prepare the people for the worthy reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and enlighten them on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of their daily lives, affords a powerful means to renovate a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> spiritually. Everyone finds in these sermons and instructions something that appeals peculiarly to him, and is likely to bear fruit in the future. These missions are for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> what retreats are for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. In fact they are an adaptation to the needs and capacities of the faithful of the spiritual exercises long traditional in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and made use of especially during the Ages of Faith when people were in the habit of retiring to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> to devote themselves for a certain period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to that renewal in the spirit of their mind, which the Apostle recommends: "And be renewed in the spirit of your mind: and put on the new man, who according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is created in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs23">Ephesians 4:23, 24</a>). In view, then, of the many benefits that accrue from a retreat, it is no exaggeration to say that, in the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, a mission is the greatest grace that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can confer upon any <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. "There is nothing", says <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a>, "that is better adapted than missions or retreats to enlighten the minds of men, to purify corrupt hearts and to lead all to the exercise of a truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life".

<p>The usefulness of missions, moreover, for the sanctification and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> has received not a little recognition from various <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> during the last two centuries. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> recommended the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius as "full of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and very useful and salutary for the edification and spiritual advancement of the faithful". <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, after comparing missionaries to those whom the Apostles Peter and Andrew called to assist them in landing their nets, says that for "purifying corrupt <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> . . . nothing is more effective than to solicit the aid of others, namely to establish everywhere (that is in every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>) sacred missions. Nor can this be called a new and uncertain remedy which is proposed for purifying the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of the people. It is an old one and indeed the only one suitably adapted to cure existing evils, one which many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have employed in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> with extraordinary results" ("Gravissimum", 8 Sept., 1745). <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> condemned the proposition of those who called missions an empty noise with at most a transient effect (Auct. Fid., prop. 65). <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> granted a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to the missions given by the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> extended this <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to the sick who could not attend the missions, but complied with the required conditions at their homes; and in 1834 the same pontiff extended it to all missions, irrespective of the orders to which the missionaries belonged. In 1849 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> wrote to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> urging the work of spiritual exercises and missions, declaring them very useful for fostering <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and exciting confirmed sinners to repentance ("Nostris", 8 Dec., 1849); and he made this appeal again to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in the "Singulari quidem", 17 March, 1856.

<p>The mission is an appeal to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the will. The general end to be obtained is the enlightenment of the former and the movement and elevation of the latter. The necessity of these are apparent. It is the experience of missionaries that, owing to the pressing material necessities of modern life, much <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> prevails among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> as a class in matters pertaining to their religion. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, there is no dearth of good reading matter whereby the deficiencies of religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> might to some extent be supplied, but it is equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that such reading is sadly neglected. To supply this defect is one of the aims of the mission. The missionary comes to instruct, to present the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> clearly, forcibly, consecutively, and in such language as shall reach the entire audience. The end of man, the need of grace, the Divine Attributes, the essential parts of the Sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist, and the conditions required for their worthy reception; matrimony, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> governing it, and the right way of preparing for it and entering it &#151; such are some familiar themes of the mission. In times like the present, and in the social conditions of modern life, the ordinary "cure of souls" hardly suffices to protect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> against the deadly influences of constant friction with a materialistic world, and against the all-pervading atmosphere of sensuality and worldliness. Passing their lives face to face with extraordinary spiritual perils, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the twentieth century need the extraordinary succour and protection which are furnished only by the mission. Thus the instructions given to the intelligences of the faithful at a mission are of no less importance than the sermons which are addressed to their wills. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and responsibilities of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> towards their children, and of children towards their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, the mutual <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of employers and employed, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> views them, are by no means to be taken for granted as fully grasped even by the more intelligent among average well-meaning <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.



<p>Here, lastly, it is important to note one vital purpose which the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a>, or popular, mission serves in many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. With a rapidly increasing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, the organization of new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> is a frequent necessity. It is not assumed by any means that the majority of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are grievous sinners, nor do the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> lose sight of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that the popular mission is no less efficacious for making the good better, and stimulating further effort on the part of those who are already willing, than for reclaiming those who have taken the broad path of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In this view, it is the common practice to commence the life of a new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> with a mission conducted by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of some specially chosen missionary institute. In such a mission the fervour of the new parishioners is not only increased, but effectively applied to the purpose of solidifying and organizing their corporate <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. One chief means to this end is the erection of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> confraternities for which the mission affords opportunity. Thus the League of the Sacred Heart, the Holy Name Society, the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin, or the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Rosary Confraternity</a> becomes at the very outset the instrument of incalculable spiritual benefit, and a fulcrum by means of which the efforts of the new <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> attain more than double the results which might otherwise have been expected of them.
<h2 id="section2">Origin and history</h2>

<p>In substance, missions are coeval with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The Founder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was also its first missionary. His life was a missionary life, "teaching daily in the temple", "preaching to the multitude from the ship", and, at the close of His life's work, entrusting its continuation to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> &#151; "Going therefore, teach ye all nations; . . . Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you" (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs19">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>). Obedient to this injunction, the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> has become a history of missionary activity, whether by it be understood the prolonged missionary labour among <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> tribes, or the exercise of regular mission work among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that until the beginning of the seventeenth century there existed no organized form of popular missionary work exactly as it is now understood. But even in the early ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> we find such eminent <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> as the two Gregories (of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Nazianzus</a> and of <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Nyssa</a>), Basil, and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, Leo, Augustine, and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> making special efforts on special occasions to strengthen <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and foster <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> by extraordinary series of instructions, exhortations, and devotions. The good work of the wandering Celtic missionaries in the sixth and seventh centuries &#151; e.g., Sts. Columbanus, Gall, Kilian, Fridolin &#151; may also be taken as, in some sense, an early type of the popular mission. Sts. Bernard, <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">Peter Damian</a>, Peter the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermit</a>, and the other great preachers of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> were eminent popular missionaries, and their appeals to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">Christian zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> were splendid instances of popular missions adapted to the conditions of the age. With the rise of the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> began a new era in the history of missionary endeavour. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were popular missionaries in the truest sense of the word. They went from town to town preaching to the people everywhere, in the public places as well as in the churches. They preached chiefly to the masses, the poor people, using simple, unadorned language. As a consequence, the people followed them in crowds, drawn by their simple eloquence. Their strict rule of life and renunciation exercised during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> a most salutary social influence over the enslaved and un privileged classes of the population. In the fourteenth century we have the eminent <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> preachers, <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a> and <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Henry Suso</a>. in the fifteenth, St. Vincent Ferrer and <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a>; in the sixteenth, <a href="../cathen/09385b.htm">Louis of Granada</a>. The acme of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> preaching was reached by the Observants in the fifteenth century, especially in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Famous popular missionaries of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> were Sts. <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">Bernardine of Siena</a>, John Capistran, and Peter of Alcantara. By the middle of the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> took up this work. St. Ignatius combatted chiefly the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. In 1592 the Ven. C&eacute;sar de Bus (q.v.) founded the "Pr&ecirc;tres seculiers de la doctrine chr&eacute;tienne", a congregation devoting itself entirely to the work of catechizing and preaching the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>.

<p>All these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, religious institutes, and preachers may be said to have represented the work of popular missions in its rudimentary form. That work was not reduced to a system until the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of Priests of the Mission</a> early in the seventeenth century by <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>. The circumstances which led to St. Vincent's taking up this work, together with a full account of his institute (commonly called the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>) and its methods, will be found under <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">CONGREGATION OF PRIESTS OF THE MISSIONS</a>. The holy enterprise of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> had <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for its birthplace; in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, a century later (1732), St. Alphonsus founded his congregation (see CONGREGATION OF THE MOST HOLY REDEEMER). Their primary occupation is the apostolic ministry in the preaching of missions and retreats to all classes of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but especially to the most neglected. The congregation spread rapidly throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. About one hundred years later <a href="../cathen/06390b.htm">Venerable Gaspar Bufalo</a> (died 1837) founded in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/12373c.htm">Congregation of the Most Precious Blood</a> (see <a href="../cathen/12373b.htm">CONGREGATION OF THE MOST PRECIOUS BLOOD</a>), to devote itself exclusively to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> mission work. The causes which have led to the rapid diffusion of this newly organized mission work in the last three centuries are not far to seek. Owing to the changed conditions, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, social, as well as religious, the older style of popular preaching had become inadequate to the exigencies of the age. The increasing number of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> with itinerant representatives, and a corresponding spread of <a href="../cathen/07759a.htm">religious indifference</a>, called for specially organized effort on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The work, once begun, was soon taken up by other orders whose primary end was different. Notable among these were the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who were the foremost labourers in the field, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. The apostolic labours of these missionaries were everywhere blessed with remarkable success. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the birthplace of popular missions, the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were the pioneers of a missionary activity which stirred up the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to greater <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and devotion in every part of the country. Other orders and congregations gradually came to their assistance, and, though there was a slight falling off in this respect during the period of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, yet, in the reign of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, the emperor himself arranged for missions in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, and Metz, to be conducted at the expense of the Government. After the Restoration in 1815, a new impetus was given to missionary work by the Abb&eacute; Forbin-Janson, who, with his friend the Abb&eacute; de Rauzan, founded the Missionaires de France, and by <a href="../cathen/10094a.htm">Charles de Mazenod</a>, who founded the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, in 1815. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> missions had been given sporadically, chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, before 1848; after that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> they became more general. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> everywhere encouraged and urged them. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, in 1843, maintained that the people of every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> are entitled, at least ex car-date, to have the benefit of a mission. During this period the German Church could <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> itself on many eminent missionaries &#151; <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> &#151; who devoted themselves entirely to popular mission work: the names of Fathers <a href="../cathen/13117a.htm">Roh</a>, Klinkhofstr&ouml;m, Pottgieser, and others are still held in benediction. On the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> and other orders from the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, in 1872, there was a short interruption, but the work was soon taken up and carried on with the richest results by the congregations which had been permitted to remain. The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, on their return in 1894, entered the field with renewed vigour.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> systematic mission work was introduced by the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> during the lifetime of their founder. With the rise of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, the Fathers of the Precious Blood, and several other congregations, the work spread rapidly over the entire peninsula, and, in spite of the disturbances of the nineteenth century, popular missions have flourished there. In <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> they developed during the reign of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, but under her successor, <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, missions were to a great extent prohibited, and missionaries banished. The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> were recalled, but could labour only on condition of submitting to official <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. It was only after the Revolution of 1848 had spent itself that the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> could carry on the work of missions unmolested, especially in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and the Tyrol, in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>. On the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, missions were again prohibited. Later, however, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> took up the work, and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> also entered the field as missionaries and directors of retreats. In 1786, <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">St. Clement Mary Hofbauer</a>, second founder of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, with his friend Thad&auml;us H&uuml;bl, founded a house of the congregation in <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, where King Stanislaus Poniatowski placed the German national <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Benno at their disposal. The labours of St. Clement and his companions at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a> from 1786 to 1808 were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with extraordinary success.

<p>After the death of St. Alphonsus, his missionaries evangelized the deserted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the Russian Provinces of Courland and Livonia, on the invitation of Monsignor Saluzzo, Apostolic Nuncio in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> the missionary spirit has, with one or two slight interruptions, always been active. The <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> laboured in Great Britain as early as 1640, and until the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> made organized mission work impossible. It was not until about 1850 that the work was effectively begun in that country. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, missions were recommended by national and <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> &#151; e.g., by the Plenary Synod of Thurles, in 1850; by the Synods of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, 1853, and of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, 1854, and the Plenary Synod of Maynooth, 1875. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> they were recommended by the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Westminster, in 1852, and again in 1859; in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> by the Plenary Council of 1886. The Plenary Council of Australia, held at <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> in 1885, and, in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Quebec, in 1863, strongly urged <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> missions.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> there was no systematic popular missionary work until about 1860, though missions had been given earlier. The <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers arrived in 1816, the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> in 1832, and the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> in 1852; but, although missions and spiritual retreats are the special work of these congregations, the scarcity of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in this country compelled them at first to postpone such work to the ordinary spiritual wants of a scattered population. In 1839 <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> sent the Abb&eacute; Forbin-Janson on a missionary tour through the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, where, for two years, he gave missions to the people and retreats to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, bringing the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in numbers which since then have scarcely been equalled. In the Second <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> (1858), the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1866), and the Tenth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (1869), <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> missions are strongly recommended. Among the more active missionaries of this period, Fathers Smarius, <a href="../cathen/15587d.htm">Weninger</a>, Damen, D. Young, O.P., and <a href="../cathen/07309b.htm">Hewit</a> are still gratefully remembered.

<p>With the increase in the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> mission has, during the last century, become an extremely influential element in the life of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Besides the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> already mentioned, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a> have been active in this field. To supply the lack of missionaries of the regular institutes, a highly satisfactory expedient has been devised in "diocesan apostolates". These groups of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, selected from the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, are trained for mission work with special reference to the conversion of non-Catholics. They are exempted from ordinary pastoral work, and held in readiness to give missions whenever needed. Under various names &#151; as "Apostolic Missionary Band", "Diocesan Mission Band", etc. &#151; the system has become established in the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of New York, St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and San Francisco, and the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">Alton</a>, <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, <a href="../cathen/11230c.htm">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="../cathen/11661b.htm">Peoria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, <a href="../cathen/13633a.htm">Scranton</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a>. In the average American <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> there is a mission every three years, in some every second year, and many make it an annual event. In 1903 <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> addressed a letter to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, in which he strongly recommended the giving of missions. For an account of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Extension Society founded by the Rev. Francis Kelley, of Lapeer, Mich., and organized at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, 19 October, 1905, for the development of the missionary spirit among the faithful and the support of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in poor or pioneer localities, see <a href="../cathen/14070a.htm">CATHOLIC SOCIETIES</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Method</h2>

<p>While all missionary bodies pursue the same end, their methods of conducting missions vary according to the genius of each institute and its traditions. In general, however, it may be said that purely dogmatic sermons are avoided, as well as mere appeals to the emotions and the assumption that all that is, is bad. The aim is rather to seek the virtue that lies in the middle course of sound <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and wholesome religious sentiment. It is with this end in view that the subjects of the mission sermons are chosen, and, as the number of sermons is limited, only the most practical topics, bearing on the everyday lives of the people, are selected. If the mission lasts two weeks, the first week is usually for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> exclusively and the second for men. If it is to continue four weeks, the first week is for married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the second for unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the third for married men, and the fourth for unmarried men. As far as time will permit, the sermons usually deal with the following general subjects, which are varied to some extent according to circumstances: Salvation, Sin, Repentance, <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>, Death, Judgment, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> &#151; with special instructions on matrimony, temperance, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian education</a>, etc. The instructions deal also with the essentials of the sacrament of penance, certain <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">of the Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, the Mass, <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and children, etc. The style of these instructions is simple and didactic.
