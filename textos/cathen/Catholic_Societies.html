<h1>Catholic Societies</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are very numerous throughout the world; some are international in scope, some are national; some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and others <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a>. These are treated in particular under their respective titles throughout the Encyclopedia, or else under the countries or the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in which they exist. This article is concerned only with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in general. The right of association is one of the natural <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of man. It is not surprising, therefore, that from earliest antiquity <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of the most diverse kinds should have been formed. In <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was able to carry on its work and elude the persecuting <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> only under the guise of a private corporation or <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. When it became free it encouraged the association of its children in various guilds and fraternities, that they might more easily, while remaining subject to the general supervision of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, obtain some special good for their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> or bodies or both simultaneously. By a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> we understand the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and durable association of a number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who pledge themselves to work together to obtain some special end. Of such <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> there is a great variety, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> both for <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, the most perfect species of the latter being the regular orders and religious congregations bound by perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. As to <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, we may distinguish broadly three classes: (a) confraternities, which are associations of the faithful canonically erected by the proper <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior to promote a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> method of life by special works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, e.g. the splendour of divine worship, or towards one's neighbour, e.g. the spiritual or corporal works of mercy (see CONFRATERNITY); (b) pious associations, whose objects are generally the same as those of confraternities, but which are not canonically erected (see <a href="../cathen/02005b.htm">PIOUS ASSOCIATIONS</a>); and (c) <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> whose members are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but which are not in the strict sense of the word religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. Some of these associations are <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> corporations in the strict acceptation of the term, while others are merely subordinate and dependent parts of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organization, or only remotely connected with it. Church corporations, inasmuch as they are moral or legal <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, have the right, according to canon law, of making by-laws for their association by the suffrage of the members, of electing their own officers, of controlling their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> within the limits of the canons, and of making provision, according to their own judgment, for their preservation and growth. They have, consequently, certain defined <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, both original or those derived from their constitution, and adventitious or what they have acquired by privilege or concession. Among original <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> corporations are the right of exclusion or the expelling of members; of selection or the adoption of new members; of convention or meeting for debate and counsel; of assistance or aiding their associates who suffer from a violation of their corporate <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Societies of this nature have an existence independent of the individual members and can be dissolved only by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">ecclesiastical decree</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> which are not church corporations may be founded and dissolved at the will of their members. Sometimes they are approved, or technically praised, by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, but they are also frequently formed without any intervention of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. In general, it may be said that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of any description are very desirable.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always watched with singular care over the various organizations formed by the faithful for the promotion of any good work, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have enriched them with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. No hard and fast rules have been made, however, as to the method of government. Some <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, e.g. the Propagation of the Faith and the Holy Childhood, are general in their scope; others, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Extension Society of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, are peculiar to one country. It sometimes happens that an association formed for one country penetrates into another, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/12139a.htm">Piusverein</a>, the Society of Christian Mothers, etc. There are also <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> instituted to provide for some special need, as an altar or tabernacle <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, or for the furthering of some special devotion, as the Holy Name Society. For <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> which are general in their scope, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> frequently appoints a cardinal protector and reserves the choice of the president to itself. This is likewise done as a mark of special favour to some <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> which are only national, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Extension Society of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (Brief of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 9 June, 1910). In general, it mag be affirmed that it is the special <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to found or promote such <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> as the faithful of their districts may be in need of. Utility and necessity often vary with the circumstances of time and country. In some lands it has been found possible and advisable for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> authorities to form <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of workingmen. These are trades-unions under <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> auspices and recall the old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> guilds of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Zealous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have made the promotion of such <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, a special work, in the hope of preventing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> workingmen from being allured by temporal gain into <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in which the foundations of civil and religious institutions are attacked. In these unions a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives religious instructions which are particularly directed against the impious arguments of those who seek to destroy the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the workingman. Methods are pointed out for regulating the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life according to the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">laws of God</a>; temperance, frugality, and submission to lawful authority are urged, and frequentation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> insisted on. These unions also provide innocent amusements for their members. Such <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> at times add confraternity and sodality features to their organization.

<p>There are a number of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> formed by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> which are not in a strict sense <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. Nevertheless, as the individual faithful are subject to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> they remain subject to the same authority even as members of an organization. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may not, in consequence of his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>, rule such <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in the same sense as he does confraternities, and pious associations, yet he retains the inalienable right and even the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of preventing the faithful from being led into spiritual ruin through <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of whatsoever name or purpose. He can, therefore, if convinced that an organization is harmful, forbid it to assist at church services in its regalia, and, when no emendation results, warn <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> against entering it or remaining members of it. Finally, there are <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> which are entirely secular, whose sole purpose is to promote or obtain some commercial, domestic, or political advantage, such as the ordinary trades-unions. In such organizations men of every variety of religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> combine together, and many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are found among the members. There can be no objection to such <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> as long as the end intended and the means employed are licit and honourable. It remains, however, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to see that members of their flock suffer no diminution of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or contamination of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> from such organizations. Experience has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that secular <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, while perfectly unobjectionable in their avowed ends, may cause grave spiritual danger to their members. Bishops and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> can not be blamed therefore, if they display some anxiety as to membership in <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> which are not avowedly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. If they did otherwise, they would be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> to their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> towards their flock. It may be well to quote here the weighty words of an Instruction of the Holy Office (10 May, 1884): "Concerning artisans and labourers, among whom various <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are especially desirous of securing members that they may destroy the very foundations of religion and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> place before their eyes the ancient guilds of workingmen, which, under the protection of some <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, were an ornament of the commonwealth and an aid to the higher and lower arts. They will again found such <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for men of commercial and literary pursuits, in which the exercises of religion will go hand in hand with the benevolent aims that seek to assuage the ills of sickness, old age, or poverty. Those who preside over such <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> should see that the members commend themselves by the probity of their <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, the excellence of their work, the docility and assiduity of their labours, so that they may more securely provide for their sustenance. Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves not refuse to watch over such <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, suggest or approve by-laws, conciliate employers, and give every assistance and patronage that lie in their power."

<p>There are many <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are members that employ methods which seem imitations derived from various organizations prohibited by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It may be well, therefore, to state that no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is allowed, as a member of any <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> whatever, to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of blind and unlimited obedience; or promise secrecy of such a nature that, if circumstances require it, he may not reveal certain things to the lawful <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>; or join in a ritual which would be equivalent to sectarian worship (see <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">SECRET SOCIETIES</a>). Even when a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is founded by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or is constituted principally of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, it is possible for it to degenerate into a harmful organization and call for the intervention of the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Such was the fate of the once brilliant and meritorious French <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> "Le Sillon," which was condemned by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (25 Aug., 1910). It is often expedient for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> to be incorporated by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> as private corporations. In fact, this is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> if they wish to possess <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> or receive bequests in their own name. In some countries, as <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, such incorporation is almost impossible; in others, as <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the Government makes many restrictions; but in English-speaking countries there is no difficulty. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> may be incorporated not only by special legal act, but also by <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> or by prescription. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> a body corporate may be formed only by following the plan proposed by a law of Congress or a statute of a state legislature. The procedure varies slightly in different states, but as a rule incorporation is effected by filing a paper in the office of the secretary of state or with a circuit judge, stating the object and methods of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Three incorporators are sufficient, and the Petition will always be granted if the purposes of the association are not inconsistent with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> or of the particular state in question.
