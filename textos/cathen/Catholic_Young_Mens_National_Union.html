<h1>Catholic Young Men's National Union</h1>  

<p>This association was organized on 22 February, 1875, at a meeting held in Newark, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, at the call of Very Rev. George H. Doane, who became its first president. It includes about one hundred organizations, representing an estimated aggregate of about 30,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and extends as far west as Mankato, Minnesota. Its objects are the furtherance of practical unity, the spiritual, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, moral, and physical advanced of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> youth, and the development of better citizens and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The means principally relied upon are: the conscientious practice and profession, individually and collectively, of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion; the establishment and promotion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> young men's associations, <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, reading-rooms, and gymnasiums; fraternal unity between all organizations aiming in whatever way at the promotion of the Union's objects; mutual assistance and enlightenment; maintenance and conduct of an athletic league giving special attention to boys of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; dissemination of selected courses in reading among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literary circles; courses of lectures to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> young men's associations, and securing to organizations of the National Union the privilege of having their own members received as guests by the other organizations of the Union. Originally, delegates met annually, and did little in the interim but enlist the co-operation of other organizations in its work. At the present time, it is engaged in various works, which are conducted largely through <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> unions performing the National Union's functions within their respective districts.

<p>In 1878 the National Union inaugurated the movement for obtaining appointments of a greater number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> to the army and navy &#151; a movement which was entirely successful. At about the same time, it began the agitation to secure recognition of the religious <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Indians. At the convention of 1879, the establishment of coloured literary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, free night-schools, the fostering of a more general activity among young men in teaching Sunday-school, and the establishment of a lecture bureau were among the questions discussed; by 1883 much had been done along these lines. In 1883 the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, in the Pastoral Letter of the Bishops and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a>, says of the work of the National Union: "We consider as worthy of particular encouragement associations for the promotion of the healthful social union among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and especially those whose aim is to guard our <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> young men against dangerous influences, and to supply <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> culture. And in order to acknowledge the great amount of good that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Young Men's National Union has already accomplished, to promote the growth of the Union, and to stimulate its members to greater efforts in the future, we cordially <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> their aims and endeavours, and we recommend the Union to all our <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> young men."

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14334a.htm">Catholic Summer School</a> at Plattsburg, New York, is a direct outgrowth of the National Union plans for its establishment having been discussed and approved at the conventions, and carried into effect by Warren E. Mosher, the secretary of the National Union at the time, and the founder of the <a href="../cathen/14334a.htm">Summer School</a>. The National Union has also furthered the cause of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> by contributing to the endowment funds of the <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a>.

<p>At the convention of 1906, held in New York City, a committee was appointed to prepare a plan of re-organization, which plan was reported and adopted at the convention of 1907 held at Elizabeth, New Jersey. Under the original organization it had always been required that the president and first vice-president should be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>; this was now changed, the various departments of the Union were organized on a business basis, the athletic work was systematized by establishing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Amateur Athletic League, a branch of the National Union with complete control over all athletic affairs of the Union, and a complete and efficient literary and lecture system was instituted.

<p>It was only in this year that a proper plan was devised for the continuation of the activity of the Union between conventions. The reorganization also created the office of the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>, who is practically the senior officer of the National Union, and is supreme in all matters affecting <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. The National Union has always been conducted by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> effort, but its activities have now grown to such an extent that they require an efficient salaried force, for which purpose an adequate endowment fund is now being raised.
