<h1>Catholicity in Canada</h1>  

<p>The subject will be treated under three headings: I. Period of French domination, from the discovery of Canada to the Treaty of Paris, in 1763; II. Period of British rule, from 1763 to the present day; III. Present conditions.
<h2 id="section1">Period of French domination</h2>

<p>To <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> belongs the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of having planted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Today there seems little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Basque, Breton and Norman sailors had raised the cross on the shores of this country before the landing of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a>, <a href="../cathen/03126d.htm">Cabot</a> (1497), and the Florentine, <a href="../cathen/15364a.htm">Verrazzano</a> (1522), and above all before Jacques Cartier, of Saint-Malo, who is regarded as the discoverer of the country, had reached <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and made a brief sojourn on its shores. This celebrated explorer, spurred on by the favour of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, made three voyages to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. On the first he discovered Gasp&eacute; Peninsula, and had Mass celebrated there (7 July, 1534); on the second he sailed up the St. Lawrence, which he named (10 August, 1535), reached Stadacona (Quebec), and even proceeded as far as Hochelaga, on the site of which now stand the flourishing city of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. His last voyage (1541-42) is unimportant. If Cartier did not succeed in founding a colony in the territory which he added to his country's possessions, it is due to him to state that the thought of spreading the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in new lands, far from being foreign to his undertaking, was its principal incentive.

<p>The second half of the sixteenth century witnessed some attempts at settlements in Acadia which resulted in the foundation of Sainte-Croix and Port Royal (Annapolis in Nova Scotia). The appearance in this country of the first missionaries, <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, is worthy of note, though internal divisions and the hostility of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> prevented their success. We must come down to <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a> and the opening of the seventeenth century to find traces of a regular colony. <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Samuel de Champlain</a>, after several voyages to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, settled there in 1608, and that same year laid the foundations of Quebec. Being a fervent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> he wished to spread the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of the Faith among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> savages of the country. With this object in view, he sought aid from the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Recollects, who arrived in 1615, and inaugurated in the interior of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> the missions so famous in the seventeenth century, in which the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (1625) as well as the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> (1657) were soon to have so glorious a share. The <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Indians, to whose conversion the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries devoted themselves, were divided into two quite distinct stocks: The <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquins</a> and the Huron-Iroquois. The former were found under various names north of the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> and in the basin of Ottawa, from the mouth of the great river to the prairies of the North-West; the latter were settled south of Lake Ontario and in the Niagara peninsula. Their total population does not seem to have exceeded 100,000 (See <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">ALGONQUINS</a>).

<p>On the arrival of the Recollects (1615), Father d'Olbeau began his labours among the Montagnais of the River Saguenay, and <a href="../cathen/09107c.htm">Father Le Caron</a>, ascending the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> and the Ottawa, carried the Faith into the heart of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> country, while two of their companions remained at Quebec to look after the colonists and the neighbouring Indians. For ten years they made repeated journeys, opened <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the young Indians, summoned recruits from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, among them <a href="../cathen/15416a.htm">Friar Viel</a>, who was hurled into the Ottawa by an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> Indian and drowned, and Friar Sagard, the first to publish a history of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Feeling themselves unable to carry on unaided a work of such importance, the Recollecgts sought the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, whereupon Fathers Br&eacute;beuf, Charles Lallemant, and several others went to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (1625). But the united efforts of the missionaries were thwarted in a measure by the Merchant Company to which the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had conceded the colony. As the spirit of gain prevented the Company from helping the missionaries, and co-operating with them for the welfare of the country, it was suppressed by Louis XIII and <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> (1627), and replaced by the "Company of New France", also known as the "Company of the Hundred Associates", which pledged itself "to bring the peoples inhabiting <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to instruct them in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Apostolic, Roman Religion". These promises bore no fruit. In less than two years (1629) Quebec fell into the hands of David Kertk (Kirk) a native of Dieppe, who was battling for English interests. Acadia, with the exception of Fort Saint-Louis, had surrendered the preceding year. All the missionaries returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Canada belonged to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> until 1632, when the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye restored it to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Thereupon <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a> gave to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> the privilege of resuming their missions, and several of them set sail for <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a>, the governor, and Lauson, president of the 'Company of the Hundred Associates" (<em>Les Cent Associ&eacute;s</em>) lent them all possible aid. Father Lejeune organized religious services in Quebec, founded a mission at <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, and opened the College of Quebec (1635). In the meanwhile other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had established a mission at Miscou, an island at the entrance of the Baie des Chaleurs, whence they evangelized Gasp&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadia</a>, and Cape Breton. For more than thirty years (1633-64) the chief results of their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of children in danger of death and the conversion of some adults. In 1664 the Recollects once more took charge of <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadia</a> and of Gasp&eacute;. In the meantime <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a> had died (25 Dec., 1635) in the arms of Father Lallemant, rejoicing at the spread of the Faith. The ardour of the missionaries did not cool. Father Lejeune followed the wandering tribe of the Montagnais and returned with a definite plan of evangelization. It was profitable and even <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, he argued, to establish missions among fixed and settled tribes like the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, but this was useless among nomadic tribes. These wandering Indians must be induced to group themselves in villages near the French settlements, where they could be protected from hostile invasion and be taught to lead an industrious and settled life. Two settlements were made on this plan: one at <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> and one near Quebec. In 1640, a new mission was opened at Tadousac, and it soon became a centre of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> evangelization.



<p>About this time nursing sisters and the first <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> arrived in Quebec from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The former took charge of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, which had been endowed by the <a href="../cathen/01233e.htm">Duchesse d'Aiguillon</a>, a niece of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>; the latter, under the celebrated Marie de l'Incarnation, devoted themselves to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls. Their protectress, Madame de la Peltrie, followed them. These heroic <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> vied with one another in their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion of the savages. Meanwhile, the "Company of Associates" paid no more regard to its <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> than had its predecessors. It attracted few colonists, did nothing towards the civilization of the Indians, and showed no interest in the spread of the Faith. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> were daily becoming more menacing. In 1641 <a href="../cathen/10543a.htm">Governor de Montmagny</a> had to conduct a campaign against them. At the juncture the "Company of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>" was formed, which proposed, without laying any burden on the king, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or the people "to promote the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the establishment of religion in <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>". This inspiration of two men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Jean-Jacques <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">Olier</a> and J&eacute;r&ocirc;me de la Dauversiere, encouraged by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a>, found in <a href="../cathen/16059b.htm">Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve</a> a faithful instrument of its purpose. The new association purchased from M. de Lauson of the old company the island of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1640). Less than two years later <a href="../cathen/16059b.htm">Maisonneuve</a>, at the head of a little band of chosen <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, among them <a href="../cathen/09584a.htm">Jeanne Mance</a>, future foundress of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, landed on the island and laid the foundations of Ville-Marie, or <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (18 May, 1642). We shall not recall the energy, vigilance, and resourcefulness required of <a href="../cathen/16059b.htm">Maisonneuve</a> to strengthen and develop the infant colony, nor recount the heroic struggles made for thirty years by the colonists against the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>. In 1653 there arrived at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> Marguerite Bourgeoys, foundress of the Congregation of Notre Dame, which has been so great an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> factor in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Four years later <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">M. Olier</a>, then on his death-bed, sent the first four <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, with M. de Queylus at their head, to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, whither he himself had ardently desired to go.

<p>Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were actively prosecuting their labours among the Indians. For them the era of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> had arrived. The years 1648-49 saw the destruction of the flourishing mission of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, at which eighteen <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had toiled for nearly ten years. In the course of their apostolic journeys they traversed the region lying between Georgian bay and Lake Simcoe, scarcely every meeting in their residence of Sainte-Marie, save for their annual retreat. They had won many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to the Faith before the incursion of the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, a massacre of extermination to which Fathers Daniel, Br&eacute;beuf, G. Lallemant, Garnier, and <a href="../cathen/03551a.htm">Chabanel</a> fell victims. Fathers Br&eacute;beuf and Lallemant succumbed before the atrocious tortures practised upon them, mingled with buffoon gibes at their religion. They were burned at a slow fire, lacerated, and mutilated with a devilish ingenuity which aimed to prolong life and drag out their sufferings. Their firmness in supporting all these horrors in order to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> doomed to death like themselves has earned for them from the people the title of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> who escaped from the fury of the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> took refuge, some in Manitoulin Island, others in Ile Saint-Joseph (Christian Island) in Georgian Bay. In the spring of 1650 this remnant came down to the Ile d'Orl&eacute;ans, near Quebec. Three years prior to the massacre of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> had <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Father Isaac Jogues</a> (18 Oct., 1646), who had attempted a third missionary journey to one of their tribes, the Agniers. It should be said that <a href="../cathen/02766a.htm">Father Bressani</a> had escaped from these barbarians only with the greatest difficulty, and that <a href="../cathen/03089c.htm">Father Buteux</a> perished in one of their ambushes (1652). These and other acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> had made the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> a terror to the French colony. <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> owed its safety solely to the heroic <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of <a href="../cathen/16059b.htm">Maisonneuve</a> and Lambert Closse, and to the heroism of young Dollard.

<p>The year 1659 marks the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Up to that time the missionaries regarded themselves first as directly dependent on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and afterwards for some time as under the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. Rightly or wrongly, the latter looked upon <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> as subject to his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in matters spiritual, and acted accordingly. Neither the French Government nor the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> opposed this as an illegitimate pretension. When M. de Queylus was sent to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> by <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">M. Olier</a>, he received from the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> (1657) the title of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, nor did anyone in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> think of questioning his authority. The arrival (1659) of Fran&ccedil;ois de Montmorency-Laval, appointed by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Petr&aelig;a and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>, caused a conflict of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> between the new and the old authority, resulting in the suspension of M. de Queylus for disobedience and obstinacy, and in his consequent return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. When he came back five years later Bishop Laval received him with open arms, and conferred upon him the title of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (cf. Aug. Gosselin, "V&eacute;n&eacute;rable Fran&ccedil;ois de Laval-Montmorency", Quebec, 1901, 286-87). The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> encountered many difficulties. They arose in the first place from the sale of intoxicating liquors, a traffic which the governors, d'Argenson, d'Avaugour, and M&eacute;sy abetted, or at least did not prohibit, and which was a perpetual source of conflict between the civil and the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> braved the disfavour of those in power rather than surrender the interests of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality. Bishop Laval had other dissensions with M. de M&eacute;sy on occasions when the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the former clashed with the despotic administration of the governor. The governor had recourse to violent measures. He forced <a href="../cathen/16059b.htm">Maisonneuve</a> to return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, poor and unknown (1677).

<p>M&eacute;sy, who ws reconciled with Bishop Laval before his death, was succeeded by Courcelles. He had come to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in the company of <a href="../cathen/15006a.htm">Tracy</a>, who bore the title of Viceroy, and the Intendant, <a href="../cathen/14438a.htm">Talon</a>. They came to a satisfactory understanding with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, carried on two campaigns against the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> (1665-66), whom they reduced to an inaction of twenty years, and promoted in many ways the colony's interest, above all by attracting to it new settlers. In 1668 Bishop Laval had begun a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (<em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em>). Ten years later he opened a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (<em>grand s&eacute;minaire</em>) for the training of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The increase in population necessitate a more numerous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as well as a better arrangement of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. In 1672 outside of Quebec the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> numbered twenty-five, each with a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. To provide for the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> imposed a tax on the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, which by an act of 1663 was fixed at a thirteenth part of the crops; later this was reduced to one twenty-sixth, the king agreeing to make up the rest. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> then formed with the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec a sort of corporation, the respective <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of whose members were legally established. The progress of the missions had not ceased between 1660 and 1680. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/01326b.htm">Father Allouez</a>, penetrate to Lake Superior, and there founded two missions (1665). Fathers <a href="../cathen/04601a.htm">Dablon</a> and Marquette planted the cross at <a href="../cathen/13487a.htm">Sault Sainte Marie</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> allying themselves with the discoverers Saint-Lusson and Cavelier de la Salle, took possession of the western shores of Lake Huron; two years afterwards Father d'Albanel pierced the wilderness as far as Hudson Bay. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> also restored the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> missions south of Lake Ontario, and founded, south of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, the permanent mission of "La Praierie de la Madeleine". This was the home of Catherine Tegakwitha, the "Lily of Canada", who died at the age of twenty-three in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. The Third Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> asked to have the cause of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> introduced. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, transferred to Sault Saint Louis (Caughnawaga), is still flourishing, and numbers more than 2000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. After many changes it was once more placed under the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (1902). We may note here that it was from <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> that L. Jolliet and the famous <a href="../cathen/09690a.htm">Father Marquette</a> set forth for the discovery of the Mississippi (1673). The missions of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, who were already engaged in evangelizing the savages, will be treated in the articles <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">SULPICIANS</a> and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">MONTREAL</a>. The Recollects (Franciscans) had returned to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1670, and from their establishment at Quebec, had founded four missions: <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, Ile Perc&eacute;e, River St. John, and Fort Frontenac on Lake Ontario. In 1682 <a href="../cathen/03407a.htm">M. Dollier de Casson</a> invited them to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. Later Bishop Saint-Valier entrusted to them the Cape Breton mission and that of Plaisance in Newfoundland.

<p>During this development of the missions, Bishop Laval had prevailed upon <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> to make Quebec an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> (1674); he had confirmed the affiliation of his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with that of the Missions Etrang&egrave;res in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, had erected a chapter of canons, organized his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and maintained a struggle against Governor Frontenac for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the prohibition of the sale of liquors to the savages. In 1684 he placed his resignation in the hands of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. On his return to Quebec in 1688, he lived twenty years in retirement and died (1708) in odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. In 1878 his body was removed from the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> where he wished to lie, and a process for his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> was begun and submitted for the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. Bishop Laval was succeeded by Bishop Saint-Vallier, to whom Quebec owes the foundation of its General Hospital, a work of no little labour and expense. He freed the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> functions imposed upon it by his predecessor, so that it might be thenceforth devoted solely to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Meanwhile the English admiral Phipps, had attacked Quebec (1690) with thirty-two ships. While Frontenac made preparations for its defence the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in a pastoral letter exhorted the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> to do their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> valiantly. After fruitless attacks the enemy withdrew, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in fulfilment of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, dedicated to Our Lady of Victory the church in the lower town. It is still standing. The era of the great missions had come to an end, yet de la Mothe-Cadillac with a hundred <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> and a missionary founded, in 1701, the city of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>. The Seminary of Quebec sent apostles to the Tamarois, between the Illinois and the Ohio rivers. The Recollects took over the missions of the Ile Royale, or Cape Breton. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> on their part evangelized the Miamis, the <a href="../cathen/14017a.htm">Sioux</a>, the Outaouais (Ottawas), and the Illinois.

<p>In the meantime <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> continued to cast <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> eyes on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colony of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, with her lack of foresight, was neglecting more and more. After the close of the seventeenth century there was scarcely any emigration from the mother country to <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> was forced to rely on her own resources for her preservation and growth. Her population, which in 1713 was 18,000, had increased to 42,000 by 1739, the year of the last census taken under French administration. This was a small number at best to stand out against the colonists of New England, who numbered 262,000 in 1706. Acadia was especially weak, having only 2000 inhabitants, and against her the efforts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and her American colonies were first directed. Port royal was taken in 1710, and three years later, by the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> ceded to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> Acadia, <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, and the Hudson Bay territory. As early as 1604 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries had gone to Acadia and converted to the Faith its native Indians, the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmac</a> and the Abnaki. The English conquest did not interrupt their missionary activity, but it often rendered their labours more difficult. Fortified by them, the Acadians increased in number, despite English <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and about 1750 their number had risen to 15,000. The company of Saint-Sulpice and the Seminary of Quebec supplied them with their principal missionaries. The incredible vexations to which the unhappy Acadians were subjected by unworthy English governors will not be recounted here. History has branded their memory with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, especially that of Lawrence, who with calculating <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> embarked (1755) the Acadians on English vessels and scattered them throughout the American colonies. This act of barbarism, which has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> his name to be execrated by all men, furnished Longfellow with the inspiration for his touching poem, "Evangeline". <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in the meantime enjoyed comparative peace. There was a presentiment, however, that <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> would soon make a final effort to conquer the country. Instead of sending colonists and troops the French Government persisted in constructing at great expense fortifications at Louisburg and at Quebec.

<p>After making rich donations to the religious establishments of Quebec (estimated at 600,000 livres, about $120,000), Bishop Saint-Vallier died in 1727. His successor was Bishop Duplessis-Mornay, whom infirmities prevented from coming to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. <a href="../cathen/05137a.htm">Bishop Dosquet</a>, his coadjutor and administrator from 1729, succeeded him in 1733, and laboured earnestly for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and for the increase of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls was in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, who had one boarding -school at Quebec and another at <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, and of the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame, of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, who had fourteen houses. Primary instruction for boys was conducted by male teachers. Prematurely exhausted by the rigour of the climate, <a href="../cathen/05137a.htm">Bishop Dosquet</a> resigned his office and left <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. His successor, Bishop Lauberiviere, died on his arrival at Quebec, a victim of his devotion to the sick soldiers on the voyage from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. With Bishop Pontbriand (1741-1760) we reach the end of the French rule. He restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Quebec then falling into decay, went to the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> of <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> and the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu of Quebec on the occasion of disastrous fires, administered his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> wisely, and was a model for his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in wisdom and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> still pursued their beneficent work. To their superior, M. de Belmont (1701-32) must be ascribed the construction of the Fort of the Mountain and of the old <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> which is still in existence, and the opening of the Lachine canal. M. Normant du Faradon, his successor (1732-59), saved the General Hospital from ruin, and entrusted it to the "Grey Nuns", whose founder he may be called, together with the <a href="../cathen/15736c.htm">Venerable M&egrave;re d'Youville</a>. The Abb&eacute; Fran&ccedil;ois Piquet, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the city of <a href="../cathen/11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a> as its founder (1749), was also a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician. The well-known events which hastened the fall of the colony are a part of general history. After the capture of Quebec by Wolfe (1759), Bishop Pontbriand took refuge with the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, where he died before that city fell into the hands of the English. On 10 February, 1763, the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was signed, ceding <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, closing for the Church in Canada the period of establishment and settlement, and opening the period of conflict and development.
<h2 id="section2">Period of British rule (1763&mdash;)</h2>

<p>At the time of the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (see <a href="../cathen/12593c.htm">QUEBEC</a>) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, all of french descent, scarcely numbered 70,000. Abandoned by their civil rulers and representatives, who had returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, they owed to their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the preservation of their Faith and in great measure the recovery of their political and civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. While the clauses of the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> were still under discussion a memorial had been laid before the French ambassador in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> concerning the religious affairs of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. This demanded, among other things, security for the See and Chapter of Quebec. The intentions of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government were quite different. It proposed to substitute the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">English Protestantism</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and it flattered itself that it could easily overcome the scruples of a handful of French colonists. With this end in view it spared <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> no vexation. The government policy was especially active against the young, who were to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of a marked <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> tone. The <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, who had good cause for anxiety, sent a deputation to King George III, to demand the maintenance of their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization and to complain of violations of the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, which assured them religious liberty.

<p>In the meantime the Chapter of Quebec proceeded to elect M. de Montgolfier, superior of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The English authorities refused consent to his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Oliver Briand, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a> to Bishop Pontbriand, was then <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with only the tacit consent of the Government, which always refused him the title of Bishop, which it reserved for the head of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>; instead of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> they used the term Superintendent (Surintendant) of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Worship. The communities of men, Recollects, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, were forbidden to take <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, or to receive members from abroad. They were marked out for extinction, and the State declared itself heir to their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The English confiscated the goods of the Recollects and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1774, and granted the religious modest pensions. The <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> fared better. In 1793, of the thirty <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> living in 1759 there remained only two septuagenarians, whose last moments were being eagerly looked for, when the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government relaxed its rigour in favour of the victims of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, and opened <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> as a place of refuge for <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>While <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests on the banks of the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> were thus menaced by the new English masters there was brewing an event, big with consequences, that counselled more moderation. The British American colonies were threatening revolt. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> realized that she must conciliate the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> at any cost, and by the Quebec Act of 1774 she granted them many liberties hitherto withheld or suppressed. (See <a href="../cathen/12593c.htm">QUEBEC</a>). This was due chiefly to Governor Guy Carleton (1769-96), who was wise, judicious, and tolerant, very sympathetic toward <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by Bishop Briand and his flock. The Americans were unable to induce the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> to take part in the American Revolution, and Montgomery's invasion (1775) was checked at Quebec. Led by Bishop Briand, the champions of loyalty were the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, whom Great Britain had hitherto regarded with suspicion. Bishop Briand resigned in 1784. By this time <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> numbered 130,000. The Maritime Provinces &#151; New Brunswick, <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, and even the Ile Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island) &#151; were being peopled by Scotch and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03079c.htm">EDMUND BURKE</a>). Bishop d'Esglis succeeded Bishop Briand, who, to forestall a vacancy hastened to secure a successor in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Fran&ccedil;ois Hubert (1788). The diocese now contained 160 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, among them the Abb&eacute;s Desjardins, Sigogne, Calonne, and Picquart, who gathered again the scattered remnants of the Acadians, a race supposed to be practically extinct. There is an interesting memorial of Bishop Hubert to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (1794), in which he notes the fidelity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to their religion, and dwells upon the necessity of creating new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The opposition of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government continued inexorable, so that it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to wait for more propitious circumstances. This opposition was all the more unjustifiable, becoming evident, as it did, shortly after the constitutional Act of 1791. This was the famous act which granted <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> a constitutional government, and divided the country into two provinces, Upper and Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, each having a governor, an assembly, and a legislative council. Concerning the french <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inhabitants of Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> the Act read: "All possible care must be taken to ensure them the enjoyment of the civil and religious <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> guaranteed them by the terms of the capitulation of the province, or since accorded them by the liberal and enlightened spirit of the British Government" (Christie, op. cit. infra, 16; Pagnuelo, 69).

<p>During the episcopate of <a href="../cathen/04717b.htm">Bishop Denaut</a> (1797-1806) and Bishop Octave Plessis (1806-1825) the antagonism of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Protestantism</a> manifested itself in two very different forms. Under the name of "Royal Institution" Dr. Mountain, the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, devised a corporation which was to monopolize instruction in all its stages by concentrating all <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> authority in the hands of the governor. In this way the entire <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system was to be withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and fall under <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> control; the natural result would be the easy seduction of childhood and youth. The vigilance of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and of <a href="../cathen/04717b.htm">Bishop Denaut</a> balked these astute machinations (Pagnuelo, "Etudes historiques et l&eacute;gales sur la libert&eacute; religieuse en Canada", Montreal, 1872). The difficulties which beset Bishop Plessis were a different kind. He had to deal with a powerful and fanatical oligarchy determined to reduce the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to a condition of servitude to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, to make it, as in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, a docile instrument of the Government, in a word, to insensibly render <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> by administrative pressure. The chief spirit of this coalition was a certain Witzius Ryland, secretary to the governors of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> from 1790 to 1812. His policy was the confiscation of all <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> and the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> from its dominant position. It was to be treated as a dissenting <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, tolerated by the condescension of the authorities. Chief Justice Monk, Attorney-General Sewell, and the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Bishop Mountain shared the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and they had no difficulty in converting to their opinions the governor, James Craig, whose administration has been called a "reign of terror". Bishop Plessis was given to understand that he must recognize the royal authority in religious matters, renounce his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> matters, and subordinate his administration to state supremacy. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was quite able to hold his own against his opponents. Firm yet gentle, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to maintain his independence, abdicate no right, and renounce no just claim, yet he never wounded English feeling. In the end he was successful. It must be admitted indeed that Providence sent him unexpected support. The War of 1812 had just broken out between Great Britain and the United states. Bishop Plessis took the same stand as Bishop Briand thirty years before. He did all in his power to maintain the loyalty of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and to promote the defence of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. When the American invasion had been repelled, the governor, Sir George Pr&eacute;vost, felt that a renewal of the early conflict would be a poor return on the part of the Government. He conceded to the Bishop and his successors the official recognition of the title of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec (1813), and granted them a yearly stipend of $5000. For some years (1814-20) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> enjoyed a certain degree of favour. During this time the Vicariate Apostolic of Nova Scotia was erected (1817), and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec given the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, with <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a> (1819). Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> was placed under Bishop Alexander MacDonnell (q.v.) and Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick under Bishop McEachern (q.v.) Bishops were later placed over the North-West and the district of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1820).

<p>The favour granted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could not fail to arouse some dissatisfaction. A group of fanatics resolved to abrogate the Constitution of 1791, which had separated Upper from lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and to bring about the union of the two provinces, the one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, the other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, on the most <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> terms, with a view to destroying the influence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and French population. The plot found a powerful agent in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in a certain Ellice, who succeeded in having a bill to this effect brought before the House of Commons (1822). It could have passed almost unnoticed had not one Parker, an enemy of Ellice, put the ministry on its guard. The news of this attempt caused great excitement in Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Bishop Plessis and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> drew up protests, which were quickly endorsed with 60,000 signatures, and were taken to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> by Papineau and Neilson, legislative councillors. Their mission was successful, and the bill was withdrawn.

<p>Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> population continued to increase. In 1832 the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> alone numbered 380,000. Primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> multiplied everywhere, promoted by the Educational Society (<em>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'&eacute;ducation</em>) of Quebec and by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (<em>Ecoles de fabrique</em>). Colleges for secondary instruction were founded wherever needed, and several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> were erected: <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a> (1826), Charlottetown (1829), and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1836). In all these movements Bishop Panet (1825-32), successor to Bishop Plessis, took a leading part. He died the year of the cholera, which carried off 4000 in five weeks, and was succeeded by Bishop Signay, whose episcopate was marked by several calamities: a second scourge of the cholera (1834); civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (1837-38); disastrous fires which reduced Quebec to a mass of ruins (1845); and the typhus fever brought by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants, driven from their country by the terrible famine and evictions of 1847.

<p>This period is marked by the solution of a question which had been agitated since the conquest: the recognition by the British Crown of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, which being of considerable value, aroused great cupidity. The bigoted counsellors who surrounded Sir James Craig at the beginning of the nineteenth century urged its confiscation. Sewell made reports and suggested plans; Ryland made vigorous use of his pen and was most active in promoting the cause; he went to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> for the same purpose. The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government did not reply. In his memoir of 1819 M. Roux, superior of Saint-Sulpice at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, answered every adverse claim, and Bishop Plessis pleaded the same cause with great force before Lord Bathurst (1821). The attacks were renewed in 1829, and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was on the point of giving up its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in exchange for an annual income. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when appealed to, refused to ratify any such transaction, and the matter dragged on. Finally Queen victoria, by an ordinance of the Privy Council, declared the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice the lawful owner of its holdings, an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which permitted the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> to continue their beneficent work. <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> owed to them its prosperity, the settlement of the surrounding districts, its flourishing college and great church of Notre-Dame, the work of M. Roux (1825-30). It owed to them also its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. A short time previous M. Quiblier, successor of M. Roux, had brought to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>. The Grand S&eacute;minaire, now so prosperous, was soon to open (1840).

<p>In 1840 the union of Upper and Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, so long fought off by the latter as an act of gross <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, was accomplished. The avowed aim of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> was to make Quebec subject to <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, the French element to the English, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. Contrary to all expectation, this act turned out favourable to the liberty and progress of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Far from abrogating the provisions of the constitution of 1791 concerning the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, it extended them, at the same time providing for their enforcement. For in 1840, after the guarantees of liberty given the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government, the spiritual supremacy of the king in religious affairs could not be maintained as defined in the Royal Instructions of 1791. Let us add that Lord Elgin, a broad-minded governor, appeared on the scene, and recognized that it was time to put an end to a system of government based on partiality and the denial of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>To this governor <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> is indebted for her religious liberty, plainly granted in an act of 1851 issued by the King of Great Britain and published in the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> press, 1 June 1852. Here it is formally stated that the "free exercise and enjoyment of profession and religious worship, without distinction or preference, are permitted by the constitution and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of this province of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to all the subjects of His Majesty in the said province."

<p>The fifteen years that followed the Act of Union were therefore very productive for <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Archbishop Signay of Quebec, his successor, Archbishop Turgeon (1850), and in an especial manner Bishop Ignace Bourget, the successor Bishop Lartigue in the See of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, gave a great impetus to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. During their episcopates five <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of men and sixteen of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> either arose on <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> soil or came thither from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The following may be mentioned: Oblate Fathers of Mary Immaculate, who were to repeat among the savages of the "Far West" the missionary successes of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> during the seventeenth century; The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> (1842), whom <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> had been calling in vain for over fifty years; the Clerics of St. Viator, and the Fathers of the Holy Cross. In this period were founded at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>: the Sisters of Providence (1843), the <a href="../cathen/10678a.htm">Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary</a> (1843), the Sisters of Mercy (1848), the Sisters of St. Anne (1850); at Quebec, the Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (1850). The number of sees was increased by the foundation of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a> (1841), Halifax (1842), raised to an archdiocese in 1852, St. John, New Brunswick (1842), Arichat, Nova Scotia (1844), transferred to Antigonish in 1886, Bytown or Ottawa (1847), St. John's, Newfoundland (1847). The First Council of Quebec, since 1844 a Metropolitan See, with <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a>, and Toronto for suffragans, was held in 1851. The Sees of <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> and St. Hyacinthe were erected in 1851. This decade was also marked by: (1) the celebrated "missions" of Monsignor de Forbin-Janson, former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, and the institution of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> retreats; (2) the adoption of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system that assured separate primary and normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (1841); (3) a genuine crusade for the promotion of temperance (1843) and the founding of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for the suppression of alcoholism; (4) the establishment of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith and the Work of the Holy Childhood; (5) colonization <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> to provide for the surplus of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> population (1848).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population now needed more primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; the need was met chiefly by <a href="../cathen/10147b.htm">Meilleur</a>, the superintendent of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. On assuming office he found a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> attendance of only 3000, which, when he retired in 1855, thirteen years later, had increased to 127,000. New centres of secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> has been opened: the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/08496b.htm">Joliette</a> (1846), Saint-Laurent (1847), Rigaud (1850), Sainte-Marie de Monnoir (1853), and L&eacute;vis (1853). The following year (1854) the inauguration of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a> at Quebec, <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> all the generous efforts already made for the cause of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. This was also due to the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The First council of Quebec had manifested the need and desire for such an institution; less than ten years later all the difficulties had been surmounted, and the Seminary of Quebec, which had undertaken this difficult task, could exhibit fresh <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of its devotion to Church and country. <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a> had already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> its worth and accomplished much good when it was canonically established by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (1876).

<p>While the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was thus progressing in Eastern <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, in the West it was only beginning its work. About 1818 a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Diocese of Quebec, the Abb&eacute; Provencher, founded on the banks of the Red River the first Western <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> missions beyond the pale of civilization. Two years later he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and for the remaining years of his life Bishop Provencher multiplied his labours, called to his aid assistants, and sent missionaries as far as <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>. In 1844 he was made Vicar apostolic of the North-West, and in 1847 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Boniface. The same year another missionary from Quebec, <a href="../cathen/04706a.htm">Modeste Demers</a>, was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a>. To establish his missions securely Bishop Provencher invited to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the Oblate Fathers, recently established at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. They accepted the invitation, and in 1853 one of their number, <a href="../cathen/14427c.htm">Bishop Tach&eacute;</a>, succeeded the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Boniface. In 1862 the <a href="../cathen/02033a.htm">Vicariate Apostolic of Athabaska</a> was erected, with <a href="../cathen/05785c.htm">Bishop Faraud</a> (1828-90) as titular. The <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of St. Boniface (Manitoba) was created in 1871. <a href="../cathen/14427c.htm">Bishop Tach&eacute;</a> was raised to the rank of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, and his coadjutor, Monseigneur Grandin (1829-1902), was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the newly-erected see of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a>. To the See of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02033a.htm">Vicariate Apostolic of Athabaska</a> were added in 1890 the Vicariate Apostolic of Saskatchewan, raised in 1908, to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, with the title of <a href="../cathen/12427b.htm">Prince Albert</a>, and the See of New Westminster (British Columbia), and in 1901 the Vicariate Apostolic of Mackenzie and the Yukon. The last department, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (1903), was detached from St. Boniface and attached to Victoria (Vancouver), which was raised to <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> rank, and has been known since 1904 as the archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>.

<p>While the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> was forming in the West the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was pursuing her beneficent work in Eastern <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. At the Second Council of Quebec (1854) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> disciplinary regulations concerning primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a>, temperance, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>, politics, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> Bibles, immoral books, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>. The definition of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception (8 Dec., 1854) brought <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the hearts of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and faithful. During the ensuing years the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> watched sadly the march of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and events in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> drew attention in the pastorals to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> condemned by the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were indignant at the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a>, and seven corps of Zouaves were spontaneously formed to hasten to the defence of the common father of the faithful (1868-1870). The division of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> into <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> should be mentioned as belonging to this period. Until then the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> had been able to minister to the city. But in 1866 an Apostolic <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> authorized Bishop Bourget to divide the city into as many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> as he thought proper. <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> contained 199,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. By 1908 <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> had more than trebled its population of 1866, and there were over forty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in addition to the mother-parish of Notre Dame, of which the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> have had charge for over two hundred and fifty years. New sees were created: Rimouski (1867), Sherbrooke (1874), Chicoutimi (1878), and Nicolet (1885). In 1870 Toronto was made an archdiocese, with <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a> (1826) and Hamilton (1856) as suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. In 1889 <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a> was erected into an archdiocese, with Peterborough (1882) as suffragan. Alexandria (1890) and Sault Sainte Marie (1904) were erected and added later. <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1855) was made suffragan to Toronto. In 1886 Ottawa was made an archdiocese, and assigned as suffragan Vicariate Apostolic of Pontiac, which since 1898 has been the <a href="../cathen/11611a.htm">See of Pembroke</a>, and finally <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> <a href="../cathen/14462b.htm">Archbishop Taschereau</a> of Quebec with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat (1886).

<p>A few special points deserve a brief separate treatment.
<h3 id="A">The restoration of the Acadians</h3>

<p>At the time of Lawrence's violent dispersion of the Acadians (1755) 1268 of them had escaped, and by 1815 formed a nucleus of 25,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; in 1864 they numbered 80,000. A <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/09113a.htm">Father Lefebvre</a> gathered them together, founded for them the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Memramcook (New Brunswick), provided for them primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, organized them, and awoke in them a consciousness of their strength. In 1880 seventy Acadian delegates represented their compatriots at the great national reunion. The national <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the Acadians is called "The Society of the Assumption". By 1899 the Acadians amounted to 125,000; they had six deputies in the local legislatures of the Maritime Provinces and two in the Federal Parliament at Ottawa.
<!--According to the census of 1901, their proportion to the total population in the Maritime Provinces is as follows:&mdash; Provinces, Total Population, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadians</a>, Total <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadian</a> Population New Brunswick, 331120, 205000, 125698, 79979,, <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, 459594, 330000, 129578, 45161,, Prince Edward Island, 103259, 57463, 45796, 13866, 139006 -->

If to the <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadian</a> population of 139,006 be added the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadians</a> of the Gasp&eacute; coast and the Magdalen islands, the total will easily reach 155,000, surely an element of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> strength for the future.
<h3 id="B">Schools of New Brunswick and Manitoba</h3>

<p>Prior to the confederation of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Provinces (1867), New Brunswick legislation rendered possible the establishment of religious <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. This privilege was abolished in 1871 by the Provincial Legislature. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, thus forced either to send their children to public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> or to pay a double <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> tax, appealed to the Federal parliament. Sir John MacDonald, who was all-powerful at the time, made promises, which, however, failed to satisfy Bishops Sweeney and Rogers, who organized for resistance and opposed the tax collectors. This convinced the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> that it was advisable to reach a satisfactory agreement. The <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> law was not repealed, but enough concessions were made to restore peace (1874). A parallel act of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> was done against the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Manitoban <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in 1890. The British North America Act, which consolidated the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Dominion of Canada</a>, gave each province the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to exclusively make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in relation to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, but safeguarded all <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> or privileges granted by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at the time of legislative union to any class of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> enjoying denominational <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Moreover, when Manitoba entered the confederation (1870) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> delegates, guided by <a href="../cathen/14427c.htm">Archbishop Tach&eacute;</a> of St. Boniface, had taken steps to have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of their coreligionists respected. Despite these precautions, separate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were abolished by an intolerant ministry (1890). In 1894 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Dominion sent a petition to the Governor-General in Council. On appeal, the British Privy council decided that this appeal was admissible, but referred its settlement to the Governor-General in council. In 1896 a pastoral letter appeared, signed by <a href="../cathen/14462b.htm">Cardinal Taschereau</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Quebec province, protesting against the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> done their Manitoban coreligionists. The issue in the general elections of 1896 was whether the wrongs of the Manitoba <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> should be removed by remedial legislation of the Dominion Parliament, as the Conservatives proposed, or by conciliation and compromise with the provincial authorities, as the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> suggested. The Liberal party came into power under Sir Wilfred Laurier, and a compromise was effected which, without repealing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, lessened its disastrous results. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Liberal members of the dominion Parliament petitioned the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to send an <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> confided the delicate mission of making a full investigation to Monsignor Merry del Val, after 1903 Cardinal Secretary of State. The first permanent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> was Monsignor Diomede Falconio, later <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> at Washington, who was succeeded in turn by Monsignor Donato Sbaretti, former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>. The seat of the delegation is at Ottawa.
<h3 id="C">Foundation of the University of Laval at Montreal</h3>

<p>The ever-increasing importance of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> made it desirable that the city should have a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Bishop Bourget addressed a petition to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, asking for its establishment. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1 February, 1876, the Sacred Congregation gave permission to erect at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> a branch of the University of Laval of Quebec. In 1889 <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> established the administrative autonomy of the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Jam dudum". <a href="../cathen/04100b.htm">M. Colin</a>, superior of Saint-Sulpice (1880-1902) took the foremost part in the establishment and organization of the <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a> at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. He even induced his <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> to give the site needed for the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> buildings and to subscribe almost half of the sum considered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their construction.
<h3 id="D">Colonization</h3>

<p>The first colonists in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> settled along the great rivers, especially the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>. There each <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was wont to clear a strip of land, quite narrow as compared with the extent of the country, leaving intact the interior forest. About 1835 all the cleared portions were occupied by the growing population, and the surplus for forced to migrate to the cities or the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to find some readier means of subsistence. The emigration movement threatened to become general and disturbed the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> patriots. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> organized a veritable crusade to keep the people on their own soil. The colonizing <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is a type found only in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. None is better known than the Cur&eacute; Labelle, who devoted his life to the work of colonization, founding by his own efforts more than thirty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>. Wherever the work of colonization has been carried on, at Temiscamingue, on the shores of Lake St. John or of the river Saguenay, in Gasp&eacute;, or north of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious are found, directing and helping the settlers. It is they who still form a majority of the deputies and members who attend the annual agricultural congresses at the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Notre-dame d'Oka, the colonization congresses and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. We may add that the agricultural <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Notre-Dame d'Oka, Sainte-Anne de la Pocatiere and the Assumption are conducted by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Present conditions</h2>
<h3 id="A">Ecclesiastical provinces</h3>

<p>Canada has eight ecclesiastical provinces: Quebec, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a>, <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a>, St. Boniface, and <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>. To each <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> are attached as suffragans one or more <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> or <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a>. There are twenty-three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and three <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a>. Newfoundland, which has not yet joined the Dominion, has an archdiocese and two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and since 1904 has been an <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> is immediately dependent on the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of the Propaganda</a>, and contains about 3500 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 2,400,000 faithful. On the death of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> his colleagues of the same <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> send to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a list of three names, arranged in order of merit: <em>dignissimus, dignior, dignus,</em> together with a similar list left by the deceased <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, if an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and it rests with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, after making inquiries, to name the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It is different if during his lifetime the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is given a coadjutor <em>cum futur&acirc; successione</em>. The coadjutor is chosen by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who proposes his name to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is completely independent of the State. As soon as he receives the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Apostolic Bull</a> he enters upon his functions without any civil formality. The faithful render him homage and obedience at once. In the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> the local government accords him recognition and grants him certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, e.g. a seat in the Superior council of Public Instruction. In the other provinces in which <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> preponderates the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> acts in his own sphere, side by side with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> but independently.

<p>Bishoprics may for civil corporations, recognized by the State, and thus acquire, possess, or alienate <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> enjoys complete liberty in the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to spiritual offices, the erection of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, the building of churches and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residences. As soon as a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is named he is installed and enters upon his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. No <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is irremovable, except in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> at Quebec. In the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> keeps the civil registers of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, and deaths, which are accepted by the court. Outside the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> the civil register of births, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, and deaths is kept by a lay official of the provincial government. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> sends him, once a month or oftener, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> record of births, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, and deaths on a printed form provided for that purpose. In the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and this right is recognized by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>. This tax tends to change from a <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> in kind to a <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> in money. Where <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> do not exist the support of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is provided for by an annual contributions, either <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> or prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or else by church collections. Missions, properly so called, are supported by the Association for the Propagation of the Faith. In canonically established <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> council (<em>Conseil de fabrique</em>) made up of prominent citizens known as church wardens (<em>marguilliers</em>) administer the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

These, including church-buildings, cemeteries, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residences, etc., belong to the episcopal corporation, and it is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is responsible for them in the eyes of the Government. Members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders are under the same ruling as <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and have no need for <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> requiring special incorporation; they are always in charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or missions.

And <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> at <a href="../cathen/01562c.htm">Antigonish</a> (N.S.), are known as <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, which means that they can confer the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">Colleges</a> of <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a> and St. Mary at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> are affiliated to <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a>, by which the degrees are granted.

In the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> each college conducted by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> forms a corporation. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who constitute its staff receive from it their board, lodging, and a modest stipend. If they give up teaching the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> assigns them a position in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and they cease to belong to the corporation. They may, however, remain in the college, rendering such services as their years and health permit.

It may be added that in many colleges there is a course in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, which is followed by seminarians, who act as disciplinarians in the college.

<p>The four principal centres of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> are: the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (<em>grand s&eacute;minaire</em>) at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1840) and those of Quebec, <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a>. The first two <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> constitute the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="../cathen/09047b.htm">Laval University</a>, and can confer any <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> degree, even that of Doctor of Theology. The Seminary of Quebec has 150 students in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; that of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> about 300. The former goes back to Bishop Laval; the latter was founded in 1840 by the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>.

<p>Primary instruction is given by religious and secular teachers of both sexes. In the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary instruction is under the control of a committee composed of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province and an equal number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>; the Protestant Committee exercises similar functions with regard to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> matters in which <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> are exclusively concerned.

In that province the normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the training of teachers are also in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In the provinces of <a href="../cathen/13482b.htm">Alberta</a> and Saskatchewan (created in 1905), the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in each <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> district have also the right of separate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, i.e. they have the legal guaranteed right of separating from the majority, setting up a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> district of their own, electing their own trustees, levying their own taxes, and of hiring their own teacher, a religious if they desire, but one who has undergone examination in the regular way and received a licence from the Board of Education. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> thus constituted must be conducted according to the regulations of the Board of Education, and be subject to government inspection. In the other provinces separate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are not recognized by law, although in New Brunswick the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> a re practically separate. In Manitoba the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> question has been regulated, though unsatisfactorily, by the Laurier-Greenway Compromise already mentioned. In the North-West Territories separate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are supported by the State.
<h3>Missions</h3>

<p>Some traces of the <a href="../cathen/10378a.htm">Indian missions</a> of the seventeenth century still exist. In the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a> are to be found several groups of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmac</a> and Abnaki; in the Diocese of Quebec, a <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, Our Lady of Loreto; in that of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, two <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, Caughnawaga (2060 Indians) and Oka, or the Lake of the Two Mountains (75 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>); in the <a href="../cathen/15261a.htm">Diocese of Valleyfield</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> centre of Saint R&eacute;gis. These, however, are exceptions. The real missions of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> at present are in the North-East, along the coast of Labrador; in the North on the shores of Hudson Bay; and especially in the North-West, in the immense territories which stretch from <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> to Lower Mackenzie and Alaska. In the North-East the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, confided to the <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudist</a> Fathers, contains 12,0000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>: among them some <a href="../cathen/05539a.htm">Eskimo</a>, Nascapi, and Montagnais, ministered to by twenty missionaries. To the West there are a number of missions in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/11611a.htm">Pembroke</a>, <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a> and <a href="../cathen/13487a.htm">Sault Sainte Marie</a>. The Oblate Fathers, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> rival one another in their efforts to preserve and extend the Faith in the region between the Great Lakes and James Bay.

<p>Lastly thee are the missions of the North-West and <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>, the most important of all. They comprise the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of St. Boniface, and, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>, in both of which the Oblate Fathers have many prosperous missions. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, the pioneer missionaries of <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>, are still in charge of most of the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a> Island; as the country is becoming more thickly populated, the number of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> is increasing in <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a> and in the province of St. Boniface. These provinces include the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a>, New Westminster, and Prince Albert, and two <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates apostolic</a>: <a href="../cathen/02033a.htm">Athabasca</a> and Mackenzie-Yukon. Most of these <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> divisions are under Oblate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with about 230 Oblate Fathers, assisted by <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> of the same congregation. A hundred <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and a large number of religious of both sexes are scattered throughout the North-West, their numbers having been considerably augmented by the latest persecutions in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Indians belong to the <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> race, and are commonly known as Kristinous or Cree, though they call themselves Nehivourik. According to a recent estimate they number 45,000. <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a> contains 26,000 Indians, but of a different race. The devotion of the missionaries also extends to the numerous half-breeds in the "Far West", and to the settlers of every race and nationality. In these immense regions, which in 1845 had only one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and six <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, there was in 1908 a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and nearly 400 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, regular and secular. There are over 150,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with more than 420 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 150 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and many <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. This wonderful progress is due chiefly to the work of the Oblate Fathers of Mary Immaculate. The history of the evangelization of the North-West is one of the most interesting in the annals of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions, and its final page has not yet been written. (See OBLATES.)
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<!--Of the tables given below, table I will enable the reader to form an estimate of the progress of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population in the several provinces of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Dominion of Canada</a> during the latter half of nineteenth century; the object of Table II is to present at a glance a comparison between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and the more numerous of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> in each province. He will see that-->

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 2,229,600 faithful (census of 1901), form 42 per cent of the total population of 5,371,315. Of these <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 1,430,000, viz. about three-fifths, are in the province of Quebec, the remaining 800,000 being scattered throughout the different parts of the Dominion, more or less intermingled with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> gains chiefly by the birth-rate. Its numbers were thus increased during the last ten years by 250,000, a gain which exceeds that of all the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> combined. In the ordinary intercourse of life <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> live in concord and work together harmoniously for the common welfare of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>.
