<h1>Catholicos</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>Katholikos</em>, universal).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> title of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Nestorians</h2>

<p>During the first five centuries Seleucia in Mesopotamia, subsequently the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> catholicos, was under the Patriarchate of Antioch. In the fifth century, as can be seen in the "Synodicon Orientale" (ed. Chabot), almost all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Seleucia-Ctesiphon bore the title of catholicos, without, however, severing their relations with Antioch; hence, originally, the word <em>catholicos</em> was not synonymous with <em>patriarch.</em> Owing to the political separation of the East from the West and to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> disputes, several attempts were made during the fifth century to secure religious independence. In the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> under Dadjesus in 424 (cf. Synodicon, 51, text and 296. tr.) it was forbidden to appeal from the Catholicos of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. The breach, however, became complete and permanent under the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Mar Babai. The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held under him (497 or 499) renewed the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of independence from Antioch, and henceforth Seleucia became the centre of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. The list of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> catholicoi is given by <a href="../cathen/02294a.htm">Bar Hebraeus</a> (Chronicon, ed. <a href="../cathen/01007d.htm">Abbeloos</a>, and Lamy, III passim), the list is supplemented by the editors, III, 566 sqq. In the middle of the sixteenth century, in opposition to the Catholicos Mar Mama, several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met, elected Sullaka, and sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Since then there has been a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> patriarch whose residence is now at Mosul. A list of the catholicoi united with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is given by <a href="../cathen/01007d.htm">Abbeloos</a> and Lamy, op. cit., 570 sqq. (See NESTORIANS)
<h2 id="section2">Armenians</h2>

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> also <em>catholicos</em> was originally a simple title for the principal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the country; he was subordinate to the See of Caesarea in Cappadocia. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Albania and Georgia, although dependent on the Catholicos of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> bore the same title. Under King Pap and the Catholicos lousik <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> asserted its independence of Caesarea. In the fifth century the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> adopted <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, 491. Many of the catholicoi, however, especially after the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, professed the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The see of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> catholicos, originally Achtichat, has varied considerably. Besides many <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> have taken place, and today there are no less than five <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> catholicoi. One of them, the successor of the old catholicos, is at Sis in Cilicia, with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> provinces of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. His power in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, supreme in theory, is considerably curtailed in practice by the appointment of a catholicoi with additional powers in Constantinople. Since 1113 there is also an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> catholicos at Aghtamar with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the island of that name and the villages surrounding Lake Van. Another catholicos resides in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but with greatly reduced powers. In 1441 another <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> occurred, and a catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in Greater <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. Today he bears the title of "Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of all <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>" and at least theoretically, is considered the principal catholicos by all non-Catholic Armanians. Since 1740 there has also been a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> catholicos in Constantinople with the title of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Cilicia. He is recognized by the Porte as having <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> possessions. (See <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">ARMENIA</a>; <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">CONSTANTINOPLE</a>.)

<p>In the beginning of the fourth Century Albania and Georgia (Iberia) were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> missionaries, and the principal <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of each of these countries bore the title of catholicos, although neither of them was autocephalous. They followed the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> in rejecting the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. At the end of the sixth, or beginning of the seventh, century the Georgian catholicos asserted his independence and came back to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. Henceforward the Georgian Church underwent the same evolutions as the Greek. In 1783 Georgia abolished the office of its catholicos, and placed itself under the Holy Synod of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, to which country it was united politically in 1801. The Albanian catholicos remained loyal to the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church, with the exception of a brief <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> towards the end of the sixth century. Shortly afterwards Albania was assimilated partly with <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> and partly with Georgia. There is no mention of any catholicos in Albania after the seventh century. It is asserted by some that the head of the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Church, the Abuna, also bears the title of catholicos, but, although this name may have been applied to him by analogy, there is, to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, no authority for asserting that this title is used by the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Church itself.
