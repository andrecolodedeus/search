<h1>Caughnawaga</h1>  

<p>Or SAULT ST. LOUIS.

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> reservation, situated on the south bank of the St. Lawrence, about ten miles above <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. Area, 12,327 acres. Population in 1905, 2,100; all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, except five or six <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. The language is the Mohawk dialect. The <em>Sault</em> (or Rapids) was an old seigniory, or concession, granted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1680. To <a href="../cathen/12633a.htm">P. Raffeix, S.J.</a>, is due the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of thus grouping the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> on the banks of the St. Lawrence, to guard them from the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and temptation to which they were subject amid the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> influences of their own villages. In 1667 the missionary prevailed upon seven communities to take up their residence at Laprarie, opposite <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, from different localities, soon came to join the settlement, and in 1670 there were twenty <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. As the proximity of the whites was prejudicial to the Indians, the mission was transferred, in 1676, several miles higher up the river. This second site is memorable as the scene of the saintly life and death of Catherine Tegakwitha (d. 1680). In 1890 a granite monument was erected on the site, in memory of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> virgin. In 1689, to escape the threatened attacks of their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> tribesmen, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> sought refuge in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, where they remained eight or nine months. When the danger had passed, they founded another settlement a mile or two above the last. In 1696 another migration took place to a fourth site. Here it was that <a href="../cathen/08739a.htm">P. Lafitau, S.J.</a>, discovered the famous "ginseng" plant, so valuable in the eyes of the Chinese. The discovery created a great sensation, and was for a time the source of a lucrative commerce. This fourth site still proving unsatisfactory, the settlement was moved to the present site of Caughnawaga in 1716. From 1667 to 1783 the mission was conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; from 1783 to 1903 by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and Oblates. In 1903 it was again confided to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Among the more noted missionaries were Fathers <a href="../cathen/03024b.htm">Bruyas, S.J.</a>, Chauchetiere, S.J., <a href="../cathen/08739a.htm">Lafitau, S.J.</a>, Burtin, O.M.I., <a href="../cathen/09650a.htm">Marcoux</a>, who composed an <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> dictionary and grammar, and Forbes who drew up complete genealogical tables of the settlement. The Indians are intelligent and industrious. Some are engaged in farming, others take rafts down the Lachine rapids. The industries are principally bead-work and the making of lacrosse rackets and snowshoes. Besides the presbytery, dating from 1716, and the church, built in 1719 and restored in 1845, there are in the village the ruins of a French fort of 1754, two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. The government by chiefs was, in 1889, replaced by that of a mayor and council.
