<p>DIOCESE OF CEB&Uacute; (CEBUANENSIS); DIOECESIS NOMINIS JESU

<p>Located in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>. Ceb&uacute;, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> city, spelled also Seb&uacute; and Zeb&uacute;, in the province of the same name, is so called from the island on which it is situated, in turn so called from the Indian ox (<em>bos indicus</em>), on account of a fancied resemblance between that animal and the outline of the island. <a href="../cathen/09526b.htm">Magellan</a> discovered Ceb&uacute; in April, 1521, but he lost his life in a foolhardy battle on the island of Mactan, opposite Ceb&uacute;, and no trace of his expedition was left except the celebrated statuette of the Holy Child, called the <em>Santo Ni&ntilde;o</em>, still held in the greatest veneration.

<p>The Diocese of Ceb&uacute; was separated from the <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Diocese of Manila</a>, which originally included the whole Philippine archipelago, 14 August, 1595. The new territory comprised the present Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a> and Jaro, and the Vicariate Apostolic of the Marian Islands. The diocese now consists of the islands of <a href="../cathen/03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a>, Leyte, Samar, Bohol, Siquijor, Camaguin, and the smaller islands adjacent. Since its establishment in 1595, twenty-two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have governed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a>. The northern half of the island of Mindanao remains under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ceb&uacute;, until the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/15747a.htm">Zamboanga</a>, as provided for (1903) by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Qu&aelig; Mari Sinico". Ceb&uacute; was the birthplace of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>. It was here that it made its first stand against the gradually advancing forces of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>. Father <a href="../cathen/15223a.htm">Urdaneta</a>, an Augustinian friar, accompanied by six others of the same order, went to Ceb&uacute; in April. 1565, and immediately began his work of evangelization. The first convert was a niece of Tupas, a native chief of great influence. Two other <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, Fathers Juan de Vivero and Juan de Villanueva, arrived with Salcedo in 1567. Shortly afterwards the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> went to Bohol, in 1595, and also to Leyte, Samar, and Mindanao. They built fortified churches for defense against the Moros everywhere, and forts at Ceb&uacute;, Iloilo, Misamis, <a href="../cathen/15747a.htm">Zamboanga</a>, and other places. They also began, in 1595, the College of San Ildefenso, now called San Carlos College, in Ceb&uacute;. The work of the missionaries was facilitated by the disposition of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> but naturally peaceful Visayan people, who occupied most of the territory. The missionaries were opposed by the ferocious tribes of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, who for centuries had been gradually extending their sway eastwards, and by 1521 were strongly established in the western part of the island of Mindanao, in the Sulu archipelago. The efforts of the missionaries were threefold in character: defensive against the bloodthirsty Moros, who roamed over these seas in flotillas of ships; active in the evangelization of the tribes; and also didactic in the arts of peace, agriculture, trades, and the rudiments of learning. The natives, already well forward in trades, soon became expert carpenters, masons, workers in metals, weavers &mdash; in a word, well equipped to make the best use of the natural resources at hand. As the missionaries advanced, the domination of the Moros was gradually restricted, though even as late as 1856 occasional fleets of Moro boats appeared, striking terror into the peaceful Visayans. With the beginning of steam navigation, the Spanish ships of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> at once assumed offensive tactics against the Moros, whose vessels were easily captured and destroyed.

<p>After the insurrection of 1898, and the Spanish-American War that followed, the people suffered greatly, not only from the evils of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, but also from the loss of their cattle and horses by epidemics. Many of their churches were destroyed, not only by the <em>insurrectos</em>, but also by <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> troops. The chief <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, however, was the lack of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> average about ten thousand <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In the mountainous regions about half a million of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were without spiritual succour. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, by whom many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> were formerly supplied, began to return, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> worked with great success in Mindanao. <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a> from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> are exclusively occupied in giving missions to the people. The <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> have two colleges for boys, one in Ceb&uacute; with 600, another in Samar with 350 pupils. The same Fathers have also charge of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>, in which there are 85 students. A college for girls is conducted in Ceb&uacute; by the <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, with 500 pupils. An <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> and trade <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> under the same Sisters care for 85 girls and a few small boys. A <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was maintained for fifty years until 1906. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains 135 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and 123 religious, of the following communities: Augustinians, Recollects, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>. There are fifty-five <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, with an attendance of about 12,000 pupils. The people are practically all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and are very devout and loyal to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Estimated population, 2,145,679. The Right Rev. Thomas Augustine Hendrick, the first American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 23 Aug., 1903, and took possession 6 March, 1904.
