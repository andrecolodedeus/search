<h1>Cecilius Calvert</h1>  

<p>Second Lord Baltimore, founder of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, born 1606, died 1675. At the age of thirteen, he entered Trinity College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>. In 1629 he married Anne Arundell, of Wardour. When his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> died, in 1632, the charter of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> was granted to Cecilius, who was made a palatine, and "Absolute Lord of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and Avalon." It was Lord Baltimore's intention, at first to come to America with the colonists, but as there were many enemies of his colonial project at home, he concluded to send his brothers, Leonard and George, at the head of the expedition. The former was appointed governor. The enemies of the charter, chiefly members of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Company, did everything in their power to defeat the objects of the proprietor. It was claimed that the charter interfered with the grant of land of the Virginia Company and that, owing to its liberality, it would attract people from other colonies and depopulate them. The arguments of the enemies of the charter were of no avail, and finally the colonists, numbering twenty gentlemen and about three hundred labourers, embarked on the Ark and the Dove, in the harbour of Cowes, Nov., 1633. Before sailing, Leonard received instructions for the government of the colonists. Religious toleration was the keynote of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore's</a> policy throughout his long career. In spite of the fact that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> when Calvert's government was overthrown, every time his authority was restored <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> ceased and every <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> in <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, Baltimore offered them a refuge in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, with freedom of worship.

<p>Lord Baltimore paid for the expedition, which cost him in the first two years forty thousand pounds in transportation, provisions, and stores. He provided them not only with the necessity but also many of the conveniences adapted to a new country. So well were they equipped for the founding of a colony that it was said they as much progress in six months as Virginia made in many years. Unable to go with the first settlers he believed that he could soon follow them to <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. The privilege was forever denied him, as the enemies of his charter kept him at home fighting fore his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. His absence from the colony produced a peculiar condition, the absence of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. The charter gave the proprietor the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> with the advice and consent of the freemen. The latter met in 1634-35 and passed "wholesome <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and ordinances." Feeling that this act had infringed on his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, in his commission to the governor, April, 1637, the proprietor expressed his disapproval of all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> passed by the colonists. For the endorsement of the assembly of 1637-38, he sent a body of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> with his secretary, John Lewger. These <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were rejected by the assembly, as they were considered unsuited to the colony. A few <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> not differing materially from those sent by Baltimore were agreed to and sent to the proprietor for his consent. At first his approval was withheld, and the colony was without <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Later, however, his sanction was given to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in a commission to the governor, authorizing him to give his assent to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> made by the freemen, which would make the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> binding until they were either approved or rejected by the proprietor. With this commission the privilege of initiative in matters of legislation was conceded to the colonists, the proprietor retaining the right of absolute veto. As this power was never used by Baltimore except in extreme cases, the colonists practically enjoyed freedom in self-government.

<p>The difficulties between Baltimore and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were very difficult for the welfare of the colony. <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were on the first expedition. From the Indians they received grants of large tracts of land. Baltimore objected to this, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that any other grants than those coming from the proprietor were illegal. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> believed that they, their domestic servants, and half their planting servants should be exempted from taxation and military service; that they and their adherents should not be tried by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> in temporal matters; and that they should have the same privileges here that were enjoyed by <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries. On each of these points, their views clashed with those of the proprietor. Baltimore applied to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> "to appoint a prefect and send <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Mission." Dom Rosetti, titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, was appointed prefect, and two <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> were sent to the colony. To this the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> objected, claiming that they were the first on the ground, and had endured great hardships in the interests of the colony. Finally an agreement was entered into between the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a>, acting for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and Baltimore which, if not satisfactory to both parties, closed the matter. The whole affair seems even to this day somewhat cloudy, as good authorities take opposing points of view. Cecilius Calvert ruled over the colony for nearly forty years. Although he never interfered with the administration of details, he ruled at every turn with an iron hand.
