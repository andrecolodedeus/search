<h1>Celestines</h1>  

<p>The name given to certain extreme "Spiritual" <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of the Marches, because they were taken by <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a> under his special protection. These <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Celestines are not to be confounded with the Order of Celestine <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, a branch of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, which the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> founded about 1254 before his accession to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. It was in the autumn of 1294 that Pietro da Macerata, Pietro da Fossombrone, and some other "Spiritual" <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> who had lately returned from <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> made their way to the Papal <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, then at <a href="../cathen/01661a.htm">Aquila</a>, and obtained from <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a> leave to live as <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> under the Rule of St. Francis, but as a separate fraternity and without dependence upon the superiors of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a> Order. They were to obey <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a> and, under him, Pietro da Macerata, who changed his name to Liberato, while his companion Pietro da Fossombrone took the name of Angelo Clareno, by which he is better known (see <a href="../cathen/01484b.htm">ANGELO CLARENO DA CINGOLI</a>). Liberato, when placed at the head of the new fraternity, was given full power by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to receive new members. Celestine, moreover, appointed Cardinal Nicholas Orsini, protector of the <em>Pauperes Heremitae Domini Coelestini</em> (Poor <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of the Lord Celestine), as Liberato, Angelo, and their followers were called, and he charged the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of his own order of (Benedictine) Celestines to put some hermitages at their disposal. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the new foundation were somewhat peculiar. Strictly speaking, these "Poor <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a>" could not be called either Celestines or <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> for they did not depend upon the authority of either order and, although professing the Rule of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, they lived in hermitages like the Celestines.

<p>After the "great renunciation" of Pope Celestine (13 Dec., 1294) the Poor <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a> lost their protector, and his successor <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> revoked and nullified in 1295 all the concessions made in their favour by Celestine unless the same were approved anew by himself. Thereupon Liberato, Angelo, and some others &#151; for not all of their followers seem to have accompanied them &#151; betook themselves to the Island of Trixoma in the Gulf of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> and later to Thessaly. After many vicissitudes they returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1303 and attempted a vindication of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. In 1307 Liberato died and Angelo became the head of the Fraternity, which was suppressed by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> in 1317. The subsequent history of the "Poor <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of the Lord Celestine" is merged in that of the Fraticelli (see <a href="../cathen/06244b.htm">FRATICELLI</a>; <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">FRIARS MINOR</a>; <a href="../cathen/14230a.htm">SPIRITUALS</a>).
