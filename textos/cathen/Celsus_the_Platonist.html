<h1>Celsus the Platonist</h1>  

<p>An eclectic <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> and polemical writer against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, who flourished towards the end of the second century. Very little is known about his personal history except that he lived during the reign of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, that his literary activity falls between the years 175 and 180, and that he wrote a work entitled <em>&rsquo;aleth&#232;s l&oacute;gos</em> ("The True Word", or "The True Discourse"), against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. He is one of several writers named Celsus who appeared as opponents of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the second century; he is probably the Celsus who was known as a friend of Lucian, although some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this, because Lucian's friend was an Epicurean, and the author of the "True Discourse" shows himself a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a>. It is generally supposed that Celsus was a Roman. His intimate acquaintance, however, with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a> and his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, such as it was, of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and customs incline some historians to think he belonged to the Eastern portion of the empire. Those who believe him to have been a Roman explain his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Jewish and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> matters by assuming that he acquired that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> either by travelling, or by mingling with the foreign population of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Celsus owes his prominence in the history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> polemics not so much to the pre-eminent character of his work, as to the circumstance that about the year 240 a copy of the work was sent to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> by his friend Ambrosius, with a request to write a refutation of it. This <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, after some hesitation, consented to do, and embodied his answer in the treatise "Against Celsus" (<em>kat&#224; K&eacute;lsou</em>). So careful is <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> to cite the very words of his opponent that it is possible to reconstruct the text of Celsus from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> answer, a task which was accomplished by Jachmann in 1846, and more successfully by Keim in 1873. The original of Celsus's treatise having perished, the text reconstructed from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (about nine-tenths of the original has in this way been recovered) is our only primary source.

<p>Celsus's work may be divided as follows: a preface, an attack on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> from the point of view of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, an attack on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> from the point of view of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, a refutation of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teachings</a> in detail, and an appeal to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to adopt <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. In the preface Celsus forecasts the general plan of his attack by describing in the first place the general character of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and then proceeding to accuse both <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> of "separatism", that is to say, of arrogating to themselves a superior wisdom, while in reality their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> concerning the origin of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, etc., are common to all peoples and to the wise men of antiquity. In the second portion, Celsus argues that Christ did not fulfil the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> expectations of the Hebrew people. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he says, claimed to be of virgin birth; in reality, He was the son of a Jewish village <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the wife of a carpenter. The flight into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the absence of any divine intervention in favour of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of Jesus</a>, who was driven forth with her husband, and other arguments are used to show that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>. During the course of His public ministry Christ could not convince His countrymen that His mission was divine. As followers He had ten or twelve "infamous <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and fishermen". Such is not the company that befits a god. (This is one out of many instances in which Celsus suddenly passes from the Jewish to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> point of view.) As to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> ascribed to Christ, some, said Celsus, were merely fictitious narratives, the others, if they did really take place, are not more wonderful than the deeds of the Egyptians and other adepts in the magic arts. He next proceeds (cf. Orig., <a href="../fathers/04162.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> II</a>) to upbraid those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who, "abandoning the law of their fathers", allowed themselves to be deceived by one whom their nation had condemned, and changed their name from Hebrew to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did not fulfil His promises to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; instead of succeeding as they should have expected the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> to succeed, He failed even to keep the confidence and loyalty of His chosen followers. His alleged prediction of His death is an invention of His Disciples, and the fable of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> is nothing new to those who remember the similar stories related of Zamolxis, Pythagoras, and Rhampsinit. If Christ <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rose from the dead</a>, why did He appear to His Disciples only, and not to His <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> and to those who mocked Him?

<p>In the third portion (cf. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, op. cit., III) Celsus inaugurates a general attack on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> from the point of view of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. He upbraids both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with their ridiculous disagreement in matters of religion, whereas, in fact, both <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> rest on the same principles: the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> revolted from the Egyptians and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; sedition was in both cases the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> cause of separation. Next, he upbraids the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with lack of unity among themselves; so many <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> are there, and so different, that they have nothing common save the name <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Like almost all the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> opponents of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> he finds fault with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> because they exclude from their fellowship the "wise and good", and consort only with the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. He misunderstands the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> regarding the Incarnation, "as if", he says, "God could not by His own power accomplish the work which He sent Christ on earth to accomplish". With this misunderstanding is connected Celsus's <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> view of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> on the subject of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> special care of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> as compared with the plants and animals. The world, he says, was not "made for man's use and benefit", but for the perfection and completion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> plan of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. In the fourth part of his "True Discourse" (cf. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, op. cit., V) Celsus takes up the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in detail and refutes them from the point of view of the history of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Whatever is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrines of the Christians</a> was borrowed, he contends, from the Greeks, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> having added nothing except their own perverse misunderstanding of the tenets of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, Heraclitus, <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, and other Greek thinkers. "The Greeks", he says, "tell us plainly what is wisdom and what is mere appearance, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> ask us at the outset to believe what we do not understand, and invoke the authority of one who was discredited even among his own followers." In like manner the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> is merely a corruption of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; when the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> tell us that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a spirit, they are merely repeating the saying of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is "a spirit penetrating all and encompassing all". Finally, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a future life is borrowed from the Greek poets and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a> is simply a corruption of the world-old <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of transmigration of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In the fifth, and last portion of his work (cf. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, op. cit., VII, lxii sqq.; VIII) Celsus invites the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to abandon their "cult" and join the religion of the majority. He defends the worship of idols, the invocation of demons (<em>da&#237;mones</em>), the celebration of popular feasts, urging among other considerations, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> who enjoys the bounties of nature ought, in common gratitude, to render thanks to the powers of nature. He concludes his treatise by an appeal to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to abandon their "vain hope" of establishing the rule of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> over all the earth; he invites them to give up their "life apart", and take their place among those who by word and deed and active service contribute to the welfare of the empire. In an epilogue he promises another work (whether it was ever written we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>) in which he is to explain in detail how those who would and could follow his philosophy of life should live.



<p>The aim of Celsus's work is different from that of the other opponents of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the early centuries. He exhibits comparatively little of the bitterness which characterized their attacks. He does not descend to the lower level of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> polemics. For instance, he omits the customary accusation of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>, immorality, "Thyestian feasts and &OElig;dipodean gatherings", accusations which were very commonly urged against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for the purpose of rousing popular indignation. His aim was, perhaps, eirenic. His appeal to his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> contemporaries to abandon their separatism and make common cause with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> subjects of the empire may have been more than a rhetorical device. It may have been inspired by a sincere wish to "convert" the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to an appreciation and adoption of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> philosophy of life. Indeed, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> acknowledges that his opponent is not blind to the unfavourable side of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> religion, especially to the abuses of particular cults and the absurdities of popular mythology. It is only just to Celsus, therefore, to ascribe to him all possible sincerity in his wish to "help all men", and to bring all men to the ideal of "one religion". On the other hand, Celsus's attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> was, it hardly need be said, that of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> not well informed on all points and devoid of that sympathy which alone would enable him to understand the meaning of the most essential tenets of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. He was remarkably well read in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> literature, and, besides, was acquainted with the religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the "barbarous" peoples.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was such as could not have been obtained from books alone. He must have consorted with Jewish and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teachers, and with the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic sects</a>. Hence arose the danger of confounding with the official <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the tenets of a particular <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> interpretations, a danger which Celsus did not succeed in escaping, as is evident in many passages of his work, and as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was very careful to point out. He was acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> only in part. He used the "books of the Christians", the Gospels and, possibly, some of the Pauline Epistles, but on the latter point there is room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Celsus may have obtained his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> teaching by conversation with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, however, that he used the Gospels, not merely some proto-evangelical documents, but the four narratives substantially as we have them today. Celsus took pains to make himself acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> contemporaries, and he is unquestionably conscious of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Yet, he has no suspicion of the distinction between the universally accepted teachings of the "great Church" of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and the doctrines peculiar to Ophites, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionites</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. Moreover, he is, if indeed well-intentioned, yet a partisan; he adopts the current Roman notion that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is merely an offshoot of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>; in regard to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Christ he exhibits none of that respect which the later <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> manifested towards the founder of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; towards the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> ascribed to Christ he shows a sceptical spirit, at one time describing them as fables invented by the Disciples, at another paralleling them with the wonders wrought by <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> sorcerers; he looks upon the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a> as either a silly story invented by the followers of Jesus, or a ghost-apparition such as is narrated of many of the heroes of antiquity. Above all, he fails to attain a correct understanding of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Incarnation and atonement. When he comes to speak of the manner of life of his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> neighbours, he, in common with all his <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> fellow-writers, cannot see the reasonableness of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, nor can he reconcile with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> hope of conquering the world to Christ, the fact that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> proselytizers shun encounters with the learned and powerful and seek out the poor and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, children, and slaves, and preach the Gospel to them. His manner too, in spite of the probable eirenic scope of his work, is that of a special pleader for <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> who uses all the resources of dialectic and rhetoric, all the artifices of wit and sarcasm to make his opponents seem ridiculous. Perhaps the secret of his efforts to render <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> ridiculous is betrayed in his open disapproval of the attitude of aloofness which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> adopted towards the interest and welfare of the empire. "You refuse to serve the state," he says, "in peace or in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; you wish its downfall; you use all the force of your magic arts to accomplish the ruin of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>".

<p>Celsus anticipated in his criticism of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the objections which have in our own time become identified with the names of Strauss and Renan. Similarly, in the objections which he urged from the point of view of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> he anticipated in a striking manner the arguments used by modern <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> and evolutionists. Too much stress has, perhaps, been laid on the last point. Nevertheless, it is interesting, to say the least, to find a second-century opponent of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> off-setting the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a direct divine origin of man by the theory that men and animals have a common natural origin, and that the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sprung from the animal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.

<p>Celsus is generally described as a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. This is correct, if not understood in a too exclusive sense. Although he antedates Plotinus, the first great <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonist</a>, by almost half a century, he belongs to the age of <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretism</a> in which Greek philosophy, realizing the inadequacy of its own resources, developed an eclectic spiritualism which welcomed and strove to assimilate the religious teachings of the various Oriental peoples. This <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretic</a> tendency was resorted to as a remedy against the materialism and scepticism in which philosophy had, as it were, run to seed. Thus Celsus draws his philosophy not only from the genuine works of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, but also from the pseudo-Platonic writings, especially the so-called letters of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, from Heraclitus, Empedocles, the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, and from the religious systems of the Egyptians, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, etc. The fundamental principles, however, on which he builds this <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretic</a> system, are <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he teaches, is the ineffable, unknowable One, the Source of all things, Himself without source, the All-pervading Logos, the World-Soul. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a spirit, and whatever has come directly from His hands is spirit. Material things He made through the agency of created gods. The substance of material things is eternal matter; all force is spirit (<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or demon) indwelling in matter. The human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is divine in its origin; it was placed in the body on account of some primordial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. All change, all growth and decay in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, is not the result of chance or <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> but part of a plan of development in which spirits minister to the design of an all-seeing, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> beneficent spirit. Even the vicissitudes of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the various <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of ancient and modern times, are, says Celsus, part of the divinely appointed scheme of things. For no matter how the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of the world may differ among themselves, they all hold that there is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is supreme. Moreover, the various mythological concepts must be understood to mean the same powers (<em>dun&aacute;meis</em>) which are worshipped in different countries under different names. Those are the beneficent powers which give increase and fruit to the tiller of the soil. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are, therefore, ungrateful for the gifts of nature when the refuse to worship the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> who symbolize the forces of nature. Finally these powers, spirits, or demons, mediate between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man, and are the immediate source of prophecy and wonder-working. This last point is important. To understand Celsus's criticism of the Gospel narrative it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to remember that he was a firm believer in the possibility of cures by magic.
