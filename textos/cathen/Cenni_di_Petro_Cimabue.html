<h1>Cenni di Petro Cimabue</h1>  

<p>Florentine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, born 1240; died after 1301; the legendary founder of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and reputed master of <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> begins his biography with these words: <blockquote> In the flood of disasters which had overwhelmed unfortunate <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> not only all monuments of art worthy of the name but also all artists had disappeared, when, in 1240, Cimabue was born in the city of Florence, of the noble Cimabue <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the period, to illumine, as it were, the way towards the art of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. </blockquote>

<p>Then follows the story of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter's</a> childhood. According to <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> some Greeks who had settled in Florence were his masters, but he soon surpassed them, and his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> became so great that Charles of Anjou came to a visit him in his studio. When he completed his famous "Madonna", the people bore it in triumph to Santa Maria Novella, with such jubilation that the section where the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> lived was afterwards called the Borgo Allegri.

<p>All this has since been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, and is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, the Italian historian of art, for the glory of Florence, his native city. The so-called barbarism of the thirteenth century is no longer credited. This was, on the contrary, the age of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, and Pistoia had been built; the basilica of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> and the Abbey of S. Galgano were already in the course of construction. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> this was the era of the great Cosmati <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, of Torriti, and Cavallini, in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> of those wonderful <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>, Ravello and Capone. At <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (1260) it was marked by the completion of the famous <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> the work of <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Nicolo Pisano</a>, and the first classical work of art in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Yet this is what <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> called the "barbarism of the thirteenth century". The story of Cimabue is a curious example of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> historical data. It frequently happened among the ancients that the victorious race stole even the past laurels of the vanquished, appropriating their gods, their legends, and their myths. Similarly a rivalry existed in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> between the Republics of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> and Florence. Florence could never pardon <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> for its great victory of Montaperti (1260), and this was the cause of much trouble between the two. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the most brilliant era of Florence, marked <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena's</a> downfall. Florence alone possessed artists and writers. By means of the printing press the Florentines spread broadcast boasting accounts of themselves and these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> became fixed.

<p>Nothing availed against such a mass of official falsehoods. It needed all the patience of the modern critic to right these wrongs. It is now established that the famous "Madonna" of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Novella, called the "Madonna Ruccellai", is the work of the great artist of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio di Buoninsegna</a>, who <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> it in 1285 for the altar of the Brotherhood of the Blessed Virgin. These facts are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the discovery of a contract preserved in the records of Florence, and also from the evident relationship between this <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> work of art and other works of <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a>. Again it has been discovered that the triumphal procession to which <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> refers in his account of Cimabue was held not in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> (9 June, 1311), in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of another masterpiece of this same <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a>, the great <em>Maest&agrave;</em>, or "Madonna of Majesty", which may now be seen at the Opera del Duomo in <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>. That day, writes an eyewitness, a public feast was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>. All the shops were closed. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the Council of Nine, with a multitude of people, went to seek the masterpiece in the house of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, near the Porta Stalloregi, and accompanied it as far as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, bearing torches and singing canticles. Thenceforward <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> took, in all public acts, the name of <em>Civitas Virginis.</em>

<p>It is evident that these comprise all the elements of the assumed biography of Cimabue. Tradition was contented with a change of name. <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a> was forgotten, and the memory of his remained attached to the name of Cimabue, which explains the verse of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> (Pur., XI): <blockquote> Credette Cimabue nella pintura <br>Tener lo campo, ed one ha <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> il grido <br>Si che la fama di colui s' oscura.

<p>(Cimabue thought himself the master of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> took from him the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and relegated him to oblivion.) </blockquote>

<p>From this verse of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, which preserved for posterity the name of Cimabue, it was inferred that he was the master of <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>. There was nothing more to do but furnish him with a biography and a list of works. Legend did the rest, as we have already seen. We learn, however, from these verses that Cimabue was a renowned master in his time. A recently discovered text tells us that <em>Cimabove, pictore de Florencia</em>, resided at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1272. In 1301 he received ten "livres" from the Opera del Duomo of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> for "St. <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>" in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>, which accompanies the "Christ" in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and two mention the price for an altar-screen of the Madonna, to be <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by the said master, Cenni de Pepo, called Cimabue with one of his own associates. Here our certitude ends. Aside from the "St. John" of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> which has been much repaired, we have not a single work of Cimabue. Some critics ascribe several <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> to him, but it must be admitted that in the absence of documents these surmises were without ground. The "Madonna" of the Louvre and that of the Academy of Florence have enough of the characteristics of <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a> to be taken as <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The same must be said of the celebrated fresco of the "Virgin with St. Francis" in the right <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">lower church</a> of St. Francis at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>. But in the upper church the frescoes, now almost in ruins, of both <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> and the choir representing the "Last Ends", illustrating texts of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> from the Crucifixion and the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> to the Apocalypse, show a savage grandeur and suggest the work of a Byzantine &AElig;schylus. Nothing confirms, and on the other hand nothing prevents, the attribution of them to Cimabue. At any rate they are the work of a great artist.
