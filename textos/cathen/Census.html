<h1>Census</h1>  

<p>A canonical term variously defined by different writers. Zitelli (Appar. Jur. Eccl.) calls it a real <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> or annual tribute imposed on a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> institute by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and payable to himself or others. Aicher (par. 79) says that it is an offering to be made by a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> in sign of subjection, or for some exemption or other right conceded to it. Laurentius (III, p. 70) defines it as the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of an annual payment in money or kind perpetually imposed upon a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. <a href="../cathen/06048a.htm">Ferraris</a> considers census as a right of receiving an annual payment from something which is fruitful and on which it is founded. He insists that the census is not the thing itself or the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> which affords the tribute, but the right of drawing the annual tribute from it. Other authorities, however, as <a href="../cathen/13528a.htm">Von Scherer</a>, seem to consider census to be the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> itself or its equivalent in money, viewed as giving to some one a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to draw revenue from it.

<p>Census canonically considered must be distinguished from <em>pensio.</em> The latter is the right which a superior concedes to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of receiving a portion of the revenues of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> in the possession of a third party. Later canonists sometimes use the words <em>census</em> and <em>pensio</em> as practically synonymous. A census is called ancient of it is imposed on its <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> at its very foundation and has been approved by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It is called new if it is placed upon a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> already erected. According to a canon of the third Council of the Lateran (1179) no one but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> can impose on a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> a new census, or increase an ancient one. A census is said to be reservative when a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> transfers the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to another, keeping only the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to an annual revenue for himself. It is named consignative when he sells or consigns to another the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to an annual pension from something of which he himself retains the dominion. Such consignative census is reducible to a species of buying and selling, and is treated as such in the decrees of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> and <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> embodied in the Corpus Juris Canonici.

<p>The imposing of a census upon a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> is considered as equivalent to dismemberment or division, inasmuch as it diminishes the revenues. If the census be perpetual it is looked on as a species of alienation of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> and as such falls under the ecclesiastical laws governing such alienation. Generally the census is imposed by the patron of a new <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> retaining the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to a part of its revenues, or by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> requiring that a portion of the income of a church which he incorporates with a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> be paid to himself, or the census may take the form of a tribute paid to a mother church by one of its daughter establishments which has become independent. The "Liber Censuum Roman&aelig; Ecclesi&aelig;," edited by Fabre and Duschesne (Paris, 1889 sqq.), not only throws light on the subject at issue, but also affords an explanation of many historical events of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.
