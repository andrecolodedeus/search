<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Centuriators of Magdeburg</h1>  

<p>In 1559 there appeared at Basle the first three folio volumes of a work entitled "Ecclesiastica Historia . . . . . secundum singulas centurias . . . . . per aliquot studiosos et pios viros in Urbe Magdeburgic&acirc;" (i.e. A History of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> . . . . . according to centuries, . . . . done at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> by some learned and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men). It was the work of a group of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> scholars who had gathered at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, and who are now known to history as the "Centuriators of Magdeburg" because of the way in which they divided their work (century by century) and the place in which the first five volumes were written; most of the others were written at Wismar or elsewhere, but the sub-title "in Urbe Magdeburgic&acirc;" was retained. The originator of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and the moving spirit of the organization which produced the work was Matthias Vlacich (latinized Flacius), also known as Francovich, and, from the country of his birth (Istria), Illyricus. Born in 1520, the influence of his uncle Baldo Lupertino, an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> friar, prevented him from becoming a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and directed his steps in 1539 to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where, at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, Basle, T&uuml;bingen, and <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, he developed a fanatical anti-Roman temper. The Augsburg Interim of 1547 led to the Adiaphoristic controversy, in the course of which he poured forth a flood of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> abuse upon the Reformer <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Philip Melanchthon</a>; the bitter feeling generated gave rise to the hostile parties of Philippists and Flacians. All attempts to restore peace failed, and the University of Jena, where Flacius was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in 1557, became a centre of rigid <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> in strong opposition to Melachthon. His wanderings after 1562, and the numerous domestic controversies between the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, in which Flacius took part until his death (11 March, 1575), did not prevent him from becoming the most learned <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of his day, while, in addition to numerous minor controversial works, his untiring energy led him to devise the vast historical work known as "The Centuries".

<p>After <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> death (1546) anti-Catholic controversy tended to lose its dogmatic character and to become historical. Flacius sought historical weapons wherewith to destroy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and in that spirit wrote his once famous and influential catalogue of anti-papal witnesses, "Catalogus testium veritatis, qui ante nostram &aelig;tatem Pontifici Romano eiusque erroribus reclamarunt" (Basle, 1556; enlarged ed., Strasburg, 1562; ed. by Dietericus, Frankfort, 1672). Some four hundred anti-papal witnesses to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were cited, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> being included in the number of those who had stood up for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> against "the Papal <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>". As early as 1553 Flacius was seeking patrons whose financial support should enable him to carry out his comprehensive plan of a <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> which was "to reveal the beginnings, the development and the ruthless designs of the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>". The German princes, and the burghers particularly of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> and <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, helped him generously, but no support was forthcoming from the followers of <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>. He travelled through <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in search of material while his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> fellow-worker, Marcus Wagner (from Weimar near Gotha), searched the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> for the same purpose. Into the vexed question of the dishonourable means alleged to have been used by Flacius in acquiring <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and his use of the knife to mutilate them, thus giving rise to the proverbial <em>Manus Flaciana</em> and <em>culter Flacianus</em>, we cannot enter here. An examination of the remains of his <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, now at Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, does not tend to lessen the force of the accusation. Recent research emphasizes the importance of the assistance given by the crypto-Protestant, Caspar von Nydbruck, imperial councillor, and head of the Imperial Library of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, whose influence was exerted throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> on behalf of the work. The editorial board, <em>Gubernatores et Inspectores institut histori&aelig; Ecclesiastic&aelig;</em>, was composed of Flacius, John Wigand (b. 1523, d. 1587), superintendent at Magdebug, Mathew Judex (b. 1528, d.1576), preacher at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, Basil Faber (b.1525, d. 1576), <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>, who collaborated in the first four "Centuries", Martin Copus, a physician who acted as treasurer, and Eblinek Alman, a burgher of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, each of whom had his own assistants. Seven junior assistants were appointed to compile extracts from early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers and historians in accordance with a fixed plan, two more mature scholars acted as "Architects", grouped the material, and submitted it to the editors. When approved of, the materials were worked up into chapters and again submitted before the final form was fair-copied.

<p>Even when at Jena, and during his subsequent wanderings, Flacius retained the direction of the work. Each century was systematically treated under sixteen headings bearing uniform titles in the various volumes. An analysis of the "Quarta Centuria", which appeared in 1560, will give an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the contents: Title page; dedication to Queen Elizabeth (co. 3-12); (i) brief statement of the chief events of the century (col.13); (ii) spread of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: where and how (13-35); (iii) <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a> (35-159); (iv) the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> teaching and its history (160-312); (v) <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> (312-406); (vi) rites and ceremonies (406 -483); (vii) Church discipline and government (483-582); (viii) <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> and controversies (583-609); (ix) councils (609-880); (x) leading <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> (880-1337); (xi) leading <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (1338-1403); (xii) the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (1403-1432); (xiii) <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> occurrences (1433-1456); (xiv) political relations of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (1456-1462); (xv) other non-Christian <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> (1462-1560); (xvi) political changes (1560-1574); Scriptural index (8 cols.); general index (92 pages of four columns). This method was applied only to the first thirteen centuries, which were published separately in folio volumes at Basle; I-III in 1559; IV in 1560; V and VI in 1562; VII and VIII in 1564; IX in 1566; X and XI in 1567; XII in 1569; and XIII in 1574. The three remaining centuries were completed in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> by Wigand (who was largely responsible for all the work done between 1564-74), but never published, and the various attempts made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to continue the work came to naught. In 1624 a complete edition of the "Centuries" in six folio volumes was issued at Basle by Louis Lucius, who omitted the authors' names and dedications, and introduced various modifications of the text in a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> sense. A third edition appeared at Nuremburg 1757-1765, but did not get beyond the fifth "century".

<p>The underlying <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the work, and that which determined the choice and use of materials, was to show that while "at the beginning of the Church it was not popish anti-Christian doctrine, but evangelical <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and religion, which had prevailed", from the death of the last of the Apostles down to the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had gone astray, misled by the Roman <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. Consequently as early as the second century <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> are discovered in the teachings of Clement, <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> and Iren&aelig;us on the fundamental doctrines of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> and justification. On the other hand <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> controversialists were not slow to make use of the numerous and important admissions of the early appearance of characteristic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>. The plan of the book was a noble one, and, as the work of the first among modern writers on <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> who profess to treat the subject critically, it marks an epoch in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>; its method, with its return to original sources, is quite sound, and the skill with which the vast masses of material were marshalled is worthy of all praise, hampered though it is by the chronological division of the work. Yet noble as was the plan, the same cannot be said of its execution; virulent anti-papal abuse is common to the whole work. The exercise of the critical faculty is limited by the demands of anti-Roman controversy, and no attempts is made to take a calm and impartial survey of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> history. Its constant polemical tone, is grouping of facts coloured by party spirit, its <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> treatment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, its uncritical accumulation of anti-papal story and legend, made the "Centuries" for a long time the arsenal, of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> controversialists. From its pages they learnt to look upon <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> as "the apostle of lies", who "shamelessly imposed the yoke of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> upon the necks of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>"; and upon Pope Gregory VII as a man to whom every imaginable crime was ascribed, and whose iniquities were the despair even of the vituperative vocabulary of Flacius. "The marks of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>" were to be found in <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a>, who is said to have "worshipped strange gods, strengthened and confirmed the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and thought highly of Baalism". Through the ages no crime is too monstrous, no story too incredible, provided it furnish a means of blackening the memory of the occupants of Peter's Chair. It was the work, stigmatized by Canisius as <em>opus pestilentissimum</em>, that led Caesar <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> to write his "Annales Ecclessiastici", in twelve folio volumes (Rome, 1588-1607), covering the period from the birth of Christ to the year 1198. Such was its success that it completely superseded the work of the Centuriators, the principal value of which now is its use as a key to the historical arguments of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> controversial writers in the late sixteenth and the seventeenth century.
