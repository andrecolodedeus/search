<h1>Ceolwulf</h1>  

<p>(CEOLWULPH or CEOLULPH)

<p>King of Northumbria and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> and place of birth not known; died at <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, 764. His ancestry is thus given by the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle": "Ceolwulf was the son of Cutha, Cutha of Cuthwin, Cuthwin of Leoldwald, Leoldwald of Egwald, Egwald of Aldhelm, Aldhelm of Ocga, Ocga of Ida, Ida of Eoppa." Harpsfeld says that he succeeded Osred on the throne, but most authorities say that he was adopted as heir by Osric in 729. Learned and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, he lacked the vigour and authority <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a ruler. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> bears witness to his learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in the introductory chapter of his "Ecclesiastical History". He dedicated this work "to the most glorious King Ceolwulph", sent it to him for his approval, and addresses him thus: "I cannot but commend the sincerity and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, with which you not only give ear to hear the words of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, but also industriously take care to become acquainted with the actions and sayings of former men of renown."

<p>His unfitness for his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as king prompted his subjects to seize him and confine him in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the second year of his reign. He escaped from this confinement and reascended the throne. During his reign he appointed his cousin Egbert to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> tells us that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs of his kingdom were presided over by the four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Wilfrid, Ethelwald, Acca, and Pecthelm. After a reign of eight years he wearied of "the splendid cares of royalty", and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> resigned to become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a> (738). His cousin Eadbert succeeded him. Ranulphus Cestrensis speaks of his retirement to <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede's</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Jarrow, but all others agree that it was <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>. He brought to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> many treasures and much land, and after his entrance the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were first allowed to drink wine and beer, contrary to the tradition handed down from <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a>, who only allowed them milk or water. <a href="../cathen/07235d.htm">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, when entering into detail with regard to his retirement, says he was principally urged to it by reading the writings of <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> on the lives of former kings who had resigned their thrones to enter the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a> next to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>, and, according to Malmesbury, many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. The body was afterwards transferred to the mainland of Northumberland, probably along with <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a>, in order to preserve it from <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> at the time of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> invasion. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> in the calendar is the 15th of January.
