<h1>Cerinthus</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>Kerinthos</em>).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Gnostic-Ebionite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, contemporary with <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a>; against whose <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> on the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Apostle</a> is said to have written the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>.

<p>We possess no information concerning this early sectary which reaches back to his own times. The first mention of his name and description of his doctrines occur in <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Irenaeus</a> (Adv. Haer., I, c. xxvi; III, c. iii, c. xi), written about 170. Further information is gathered from <a href="../cathen/03144a.htm">Presbyter Caius</a> (c. 210) as quoted by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.28.2</a>). <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, in "Philosophoumena", VII, 33 (c. 230), practically transcribes <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>. Cerinthus is referred to by Pseudo-Tertullian in "Adv. Omnes Haeres", written about 240. A fragment of <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, taken from "De Promissionibus", written about 250, is given by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> after his quotation from Caius. The most detailed account is given by <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (Adv. Haeres", xxviii, written about 390), which, however, on account of its date and character must be used with some caution. A good summary is given by Theodoret ("Haer. Fab.", II, 3, written about 450). Cerinthus was an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, and if not by race a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, at least he was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>. The exact date of his birth and his death are unknown. In <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> he founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and gathered disciples. No writings of any kind have come down to us. Cerinthus's doctrines were a strange mixture of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, Chiliasm, and <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionitism</a>. He admitted one Supreme Being; but the world was produced by a distinct and far inferior power. He does not identify this Creator or <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurgos</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Not <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a> but the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have both made the world and given the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. These creator-angels were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of the Supreme God</a>. The Jewish law was most sacred, and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to be obtained by obedience to its <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>. Cerinthus distinguished between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was mere man, though eminent in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. He suffered and died and was <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">raised from the dead</a>, or, as some say Cerinthus taught, He will be raised from the dead at the Last Day and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> will <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise</a> with Him. At the moment of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, Christ or the Holy Ghost was sent by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Highest God</a>, and dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> teaching Him, what not even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, the Unknown God. This union between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and Christ continues till the Passion, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> suffers alone and Christ returns to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Cerinthus believed in a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> millennium which would be realized here on earth previous to the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> and the spiritual <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.

<p>Scarcely anything is known of Cerinthus's disciples; they seem soon to have fused with the Nazareans and <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a> and exercised little influence on the bulk of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, except perhaps through the Pseudo-Clementines, the product of Cerinthian and <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionite</a> circles. They flourished most in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and Galatia.
