<h1>Ceylon</h1>  

<p>An island (266 1/2 miles long and 140 1/2 miles broad), to the south-east of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and separated from it only by a chain of reefs and sand-banks called Adam's Bridge. The maritime districts, which are flat and low, are distinguished from the central parts, which are mountainous, by great difference in temperature. The mean temperature has been calculated at 76.3 degrees, the lowest being 28.2 degrees at Newera Eliya, and the highest 103.8 degrees at Anuradhapura, the ancient sacred capital of the island. The climate of Ceylon influenced by two monsoons: the south-west prevailing from May to September, and the northeast from November to February. Pidurutalagala (8296 ft.) is the highest mountain, and Adam's Peak (7353 ft.) is the best known, as containing the legendary footprints of <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddha</a> worshipped by <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> alike, and as yearly resort of a multitude of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The country is well watered by rivers of which the Kelani-ganga enters the sea at <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a>, the capital of the island, and the Mahaviliganga at <a href="../cathen/15045b.htm">Trincomalee</a>. Ceylon is rich in vegetation and scenery, and as the traveller proceeds from <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a> to Kandy (the seat of the ancient kings) and thence to Newara Eliya, it presents a panorama of beauty. The country abounds in tropical fruits, such as pineapples, plantains, oranges, and mangoes and in such trees as ebony, satin, calamander, and ironwood. The plantations produce, principally, cocoanuts and cinnamon, tea, cinchona, cocoa, and, more recently, rubber. The most noted upcountry product formerly was coffee. This has given place to tea, Ceylon now being one of the chief tea-growing countries in the world. The island has from very ancient times been famous for its gems, of which the chief are sapphires, rubies, and cat's-eyes; the Gulf of Manaar on the north-west coast is the scene of the famous pearl fishery. Phumbago or graphite is the only mineral product of any importance. The animal kingdom is well represented in Ceylon, which has from olden times been renowned for its elephants.
<h2>History and people</h2>

<p>Ceylon's history goes back to a remote past. Galle in the south of the island is by some believed to be the seaport of ancient Tarshish from which King Solomon drew his "ivory, apes, and peacocks". Under the name of Taprobane it was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans. Hence Milton's reference to Ceylon as "India's utmost isle, Taprobane". To the people of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, however, it was "Lanka', the resplendent, a name still in use. It is celebrated in the great epic, the "Ramayana" in which is related the story of the <a href="../cathen/01032b.htm">abduction</a> of the Indian princess Sita by Ravena, King of Ceylon, and of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which followed in consequence. We pass from legend to actual history at about the year 543 B.C. when Wijeya, a prince of Northern <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, invaded Ceylon and conquered the natives known as <em>Yakkos</em> and, having married the native princess Kuveni, settled in the country with his 700 followers. Wijeya was son of King Sihabahu, "the slayer of the lion" (<em>siha</em> or <em>sinha</em>), hence the name "Sinhalese", given to the people of Ceylon. The Sinhalese (Cingalese) being thus the descendants of the Wijeyan settlers belong to the Aryan stock, and their language and customs bear out this origin. The wild men of Ceylon, known as the Veddas, "hunters", who inhabit a small area in the remote interior of the island and live principally by the bow and arrow, are the representatives of the aboriginal inhabitants whom Wijeya subdued. The Wijeyan dynasty was not allowed undisputed sway in Ceylon, for from the third century B.C. Tamil princes from Southern <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> made incursions into Ceylon, while at times the tide of invasion was rolled back into <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> by the much-harassed Sinhalese. The Sinhalese kings most famous for success in their conflict with the Tamils, as well as for the internal development of the country during their reigns, were Dutugemunu (200 B.C.), Gajabahu (100 B.C.), and Prakramabahu (A.D. 1150). The ancient capital of the Sinhalese kings was Anuradhapura, whose splendour is even now attested by its vast ruins. In the eighth century it was transferred Polonnaruwa, which was soon abandoned to the conquering Tamils. The seat of government was thence shifted to various places, until in the fifteenth century it was finally fixed at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>, now the second city of the island and famous for the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> temple known as the "Dalada Maligawa", the repository of the tooth-relic of <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddha</a>. During this period of trouble the trade of the country fell principally into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. Many of these formidable warriors settled in the maritime parts of the island their trading <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instincts</a> are inherited by their descendants, generally known as "Moors"; with accretions from their co-religionists of the neighbouring continent they form the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> community of Ceylon.

<p>It was in the beginning of the sixteenth century that modern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> first came in contact with Ceylon. In 1505 a Portuguese fleet, while operating in the Indian seas against <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> traders, touched accidentally at <a href="../cathen/06349d.htm">Galle</a> on the southern coast; in 1517 the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> re-appeared and with the consent of the Sinhalese king established a factory at <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> having begun as traders soon made themselves political masters of the entire sea-board, forts were established, and <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> civilization was introduced. In 1658 the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> were driven out by their rivals the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, who then added Ceylon to their East Indian possessions. The descendants of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, being the product of intermarriage with the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> and the natives, constitute the "Burgher" community of Ceylon. The English first cast their eyes upon Ceylon in 1782 during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, when a British force reduced and took possession of <a href="../cathen/15045b.htm">Trincomalee</a>, which was, however, soon retaken by the French and restored to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>. But in 1795 an appeal came to the British from the Sinhalese king was then maintaining all unequal contest against <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> aggression, and in 1796 the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> were overcome by the British forces and yielded Ceylon to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; the cession was formally confirmed by the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The English had thus succeeded the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> in the possession of the maritime districts of the island, but the central provinces were still under the feeble rule of the Sinhalese king who reigned at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>. The king was out of favour with his subjects on account of his cruelty and misgovernment, and at the request of the disaffected chiefs a British force was dispatched to Kandy in 1815. King Sri Wickrama Sinha was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and the Kandyan provinces were added to the British Crown which has since held the sovereignty of the whole of Ceylon. What may be called the indigenous population of Ceylon comprises various races; to which must be added the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> residents either in the employ of the Government or engaged in commerce or industries, and the Indian immigrants, some of whom carry on a petty trade, but who in their larger number constitute the labour-supply of the island. The chief native races are: (1) the Sinhalese, consisting of the low-country Sinhalese and the up-country or Kandyan Sinhalese; (2) the Tamils, inhabiting chiefly the Northern and Eastern Provinces; 3) the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>; (4) the Burghers. According to the decennial census of 1901 the total population of Ceylon was 3,565,954 distributed according to nationality as follows: Sinbalese, 2,330,807; Tamils, 951,740; <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, 228,034; Burghers, 23,482; <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, 6,300; others, 25,591. The last includes the Veddas of Ceylon (3971) who are gradually disappearing.


<h2>Civil government</h2>

<p>Ceylon has the distinction of being the premier Crown Colony of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It is accordingly under the direct control of the Secretary of State for the Colonies whose authority, subject to the will of the Sovereign and the Imperial Parliament, is supreme. The local administration is vested in a Governor assisted by an executive council and a legislative council. The executive council is an advisory board and consists of the colonial secretary, the officer commanding the military forces, the attorney-general, the auditor-general, and the treasurer. The legislative council whose president is the governor comprises the members of the executive council and twelve other members, of whom four are official and eight unofficial. The unofficial members who are nominated by the governor, subject to the approval of the secretary of state, represent (1) the low-country Sinhalese; (2) the Kandyan Sinhalese; (3) the Tamils; (4) the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, (5) the Burghers; (6) the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> merchants; (7) the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> planters, and (8) the general <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> community. The unofficial members are supposed to be selected in accordance with the wishes of the respective communities, though this is not often the case, except in regard to the mercantile and planter members whose selection is practically left to the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and the Ceylon Planter's Association respectively. The members of the legislative council may speak and vote on all questions brought forward; still not only are the official members in the majority but they are bound to vote for the Government in matters of policy, whatever their private opinions may be. For administrative purposes Ceylon is divided into provinces, of which there are now nine viz.: the Western, Central, Northern, Southern, Eastern, North-Western; North Central, Uva, and Sabaragamuwa, each of which is presided over by a superior officer called the Government agent. Other important departments are those of the director of public works, the surveyor-general, the principal collector of customs, the registrar-general of lands, the principal civil medical officer, and the director of public instruction. The civil service is recruited in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by means of a competitive examination which is open to all British subjects including Ceylonese; a limited number of Iocally-born <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> appointed by the governor form a subordinate service, while the minor officers in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> service are partly selected by competitive examination and partly nominated without examination. Colombo, <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>, and Galle have municipal councils the members of which are partly elected by the rate-payers and partly nominated by the governor, and local boards are established in many smaller towns. An important part of the machinery of government in the country districts is the system of native headmen of various grades, who perform both revenue and police <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> under the direction of the Government agents or their assistants.
<h2>Law and judicial administration</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, during the existence of their rule, had applied to Ceylon their admirable system of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> known as the Roman-Dutch Law, and after the annexation of the country by <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it was declared by proclamation <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 23 September, 1799, that the administration should thenceforth "be exercised according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and institutions that had subsisted under the ancient government of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">United Provinces</a>" of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, subject to such deviations and alterations as might thereafter be enacted. Accordingly the Roman-Dutch Law became and has continued to be what may be called the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of Ceylon but by various subsequent ordinances and other legislative enactments this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has been either repealed or modified. In addition to the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> applicable to the whole island, there are certain special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or customs peculiar to certain communities in matters relating to inheritance, marriage and other personal questions. Thus the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> are governed in such matters by their own customs, which conform more or less to the general <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> law as found in <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a> and the commentaries thereon. The Tamil inhabitants of the Jaffna peninsula, or what is now the Northern Province, have their customary code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> known as the "Thesawalamai" (customs of the country), and similarly the Kandyan Sinhalese observe their ancient customs, which they were allowed to retain by the Kandyan Convention made between the British and the chiefs on the annexation of the Kanyan provinces. These various systems of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are administered by a series of courts, viz: (1) the Supreme Court of Judicature, consisting of a chief <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and three puisne judges with unlimited criminal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and an appellate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> with an ultimate appeal to His Majesty the King in civil cases above 5000 rupees in value; (2) District courts, with unlimited original <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> and limited criminal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; (3) Courts of Request, with limited <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a>, (4) Police courts, which are courts both of trial and of preliminary investigation for committal to the Supreme Court or District courts; (5) Gansabhawas, or village tribunals, which have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over natives in regard to small civil claims and trivial offences, especially breaches of communal rules and in which the proceedings are conducted in the native language of the inhabitants.
<h2>Marriage</h2>

<p>In the eye of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> all marriages are civil contracts and may be contracted freely between <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are not within prohibited degrees of kindred or within the prohibited ages. The law now applicable generally in the island is the Ordinance No. 2 of 1895, under which a marriage may be entered into before the registrar of marriages after certain formalities as to previous notice of marriage and the issue of a certificate thereof, while marriage by special license is also provided for. But the ordinance so far recognizes the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> views of marriage that according to it the parties holding the above-mentioned registrar's certificate as to notice may present themselves to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> minister and have the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> performed in a place of <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>. ln this case the minister is required to register the marriage in a book and to transmit a duplicate of the entry to the registrar of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, and the ordinance further provides that no minister shall be compelled to solemnize a marriage between <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> either of whom shall not be a member of the church denomination or body to which such minister belongs nor otherwise than according to the rules, customs, rites, and ceremonies of such church domination or body. An absolute <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> can be obtained only by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of court after full inquiry and upon the ground either of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> or malicious desertion or incurable impotency at the time of marriage. The ordinance above mentioned does not apply to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, who, as already indicated, are governed by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> law both as to marriage and <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, nor to the Kandyan Sinhalese, with regard to whom there is a special ordinance (No. 3, of 1873) which while abolishing their ancient custom of "associated marriages" or polyandry and in other respects giving effect to British public policy, makes provision for the contract of marriage and its dissolution in a manner more or less in conformity with ancient Kandyan sentiment, such as the liberty to dissolve marriage by mutual consent without the intervention of a court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The main difference, however, between marriages generally and Kandyan marriages is that, while in regard to the former, registration is the best though not the only <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of marriage, thus admitting of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> <em>aliunde</em> of an actual marriage or the presumption of a valid marriage from cohabitation and repute, registration is essential in the case of the latter. The system of caste prevails in Ceylon though not in such a vigorous form as in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and while the contact with Western civilization has weakened social barriers in many respects, intermarriage between various castes does not take place to any applicable extent among the pure native population.
<h2>Education</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system of Ceylon is as simple as it is efficient, and is controlled by the Department of Public Instruction. It comprises English, vernacular, and mixed <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, which are either Government or (with the exception of private unregistered <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>) "Grant-in-Aid <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>". The Government maintains an English high school called the Royal College, having the standard of an English grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. It maintains also a technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> mainly for the purpose of supplying the Government departments, and a training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for teachers. The Grant-in-Aid <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> belong to the missionary and other religious bodies, and receive yearly grants according to certain scales on the result of examinations in secular subjects held by Govemment inspectors. The system of payment by results has helped to solve the religious difficulty so often experienced in many other countries. The chief institutions belonging to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities and having the same status as the Royal College are St. Thomas's College (<a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>), Wesley College (Wesleyan), St. Joseph's College (Catholic), and Ananda College (Buddhist). Ceylon forms a centre for the <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge University</a> local examinations, which are largely used as <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> tests. The Government also maintains a medical college whose diploma is a qualification for practising medicine. Law studies for the admission of advocates and proctors (solicitors) are under the control of a Council of Legal Education consisting of the judges of the Supreme Court and in number of members of the Bar. There is no special organization for the systematic prosecution of the study of Oriental languages and literature, but one at least of the temple <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> conducted by the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, in which Sanscrit and Pali are taught, receives a subsidy from the Government. According to the statistics published for 1905 the number of the Government and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the scholars was 554 and 70,715; and of the Grant-in-Aid <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1582 and 156,040.
<h2>Religion</h2>

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> in Ceylon are <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> is professed by the great bulk of the Sinhalese population. Being first propounded by Gautama <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddha</a> in Magadha in Northern <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> in the sixth century B.C., it was introduced into Ceylon in the reign of the Sinhalese king became a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> convert and under his patronage the new religion spread rapidly among his subjects. Ceylon thus became a stronghold of <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, and it was here that the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> scriptures were first reduced to writing in 88 B.C. The magnificent ruins of <em>dagobas</em> and <em>viharas</em> in the ancient kings and people of Ceylon. <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> suffered much during the Tamil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, with the further consequence that by reason of the contact thus brought about with <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> popular <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> received an admixture of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a> which is still traceable in the <em>devalas</em> in which Kali and other <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> gods are worshipped by the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a>. After the advent of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> to Ceylon and the consequent introduction of Western civilization, <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> lost much of its prestige just as it had previously lost much of its purity and activity. But within the last twenty-five years there has been a great <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> revival, mainly due to the efforts of the Theosophical Society founded by Col. Olcott and Madame Blavatsky. Schools have sprung up, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in the ancient religion has revived, and under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a> the masses have learned to resist <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> influences and have even shown a spirit of aggression. The large majority of the Tamil population are <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, especially in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and the form of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a> most in favour is Sivaism or the worship of Siva. Besides the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> already mentioned a community of Malays, said to be descendants of the natives of Java imported into Ceylon during the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> period and recruited by later immigrants from the Straits Settlements, profess <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>.

<p>The first form of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Ceylon was of course <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The conversion of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> was part of the public policy of the Portuguese, and accordingly we find that in 1518 a number of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> arrived in Ceylon and under the protection of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> Government, preached the Faith, and converted many thousands. We read of many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> built and many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> established within the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> territories, and of the conversion of many even of noble and royal blood among the Sinhalese. Among the more notable converts was Prince Dharmapala, grandson of a Sinhalese king, who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> king in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1541 under the name of Don Juan and a reigned a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monarch in Ceylon from 1542 to 1597. About this time also took place the visit to Ceylon of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, the Apostle of the East, by whom large numbers were converted to the Faith, especially among the Tamils of the North. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> progressed until it encountered the antagonism of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> who were all of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Reformed Church and who made that form of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the established religion of the State. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was proscribed during the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> rule, <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> were enacted, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> suffered severe <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Nevertheless the light of the Faith was not wholly extinguished and the practice of religion was continued especially through the exertions of missionaries from the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> settlement of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, who amidst <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and hardship ministered to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people and even converted many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. A new era, however, dawned with the conquest of the island by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government which put in practice the principles of religious liberty, though the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> became in turn the established form of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The greater part of the "Dutch <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>" among the natives were either absorbed by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> or relapsed into Buddihism, and at the present day <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Prebyterianism is represented only by a few hundred <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> descendants who are served by the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> from <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> in Ceylon is governed by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who is suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> consist of members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Missionary Society and of the sister Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> continued to be maintained by the Government till the year 1881 when by act of the local legislature it was disestablished and provision was made for the constitution of a synod, consisting of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, for the regulation of its affairs, for the election of trustees to hold and administer its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and funds. Other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> bodies are: Wesleyan <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodist</a> mission, begun in 1814, it holds many important stations and does much for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>: Baptist Missionary Society, first missionary landed in Ceylon in 1812; American Mission (Congregationalists), under the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, whose work is confined to the Tamils of the Northern Province. The decennial census of 1901 gave the following <a href="../cathen/14275a.htm">religious statistics</a>: <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a>, 2,141,404; <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, 826,826; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, 349,239; <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, 246,188; others, 2,367. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 287,119; <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, 32,514; Presbyterians, 3337; Wesleyan <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a>, 14,991; Baptists, 3309, <a href="../cathen/04239a.htm">Congregationalists</a>, 2446. Authentic <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> statistics gave a total of 293, 929 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in 1904 and this number has since probably reached 300,000.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the above figures show, is the largest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body in the island. As it was first in the field, so it has been the most fruitful in results. At the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the British occupation (1796) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was only 50,000. At first Ceylon was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a> with a local <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. In 1834 it was erected into a separate <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>, and in 1845, as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> were increasing in numbers, the island was divided into two <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a>, <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a> and Jaffna, the former being entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/14372c.htm">Silvestrines</a>, and the latter to the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>. Again, in 1883, the central provinces of the island were separated from <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a> and constituted as the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> of <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a> under the same <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, while Colombo was transferred to the Oblates. The year 1886 witnessed a notable development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Ceylon, the Right Rev. C. Bonjean, O.M.I., being then the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a>, the Right Rev. C. Pagnani, O.S.B., the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>, and the Right Rev. A. Melizan, O.M.I., the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/08269a.htm">Jaffna</a>. In that year the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by agreement with the Crown of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> abolished the royal patronage which had been exercised in the East Indies from the time of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> domination, as a consequence, and in accordance with the needs of the time, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was established in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and Ceylon. Monsignor (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>) Agliardi was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">delegate Apostolic</a> to put in force the new arrangements and on the 6th of January, 1887, the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was formally established in Ceylon, Bishop Bonjean being appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a>, Dr. Pagnani, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a> and Dr. Melizan, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08269a.htm">Jaffna</a>. Further changes took place in 1893, when two new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, <a href="../cathen/06349d.htm">Galle</a> and Trincomalee, were formed from the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> province were placed in the former and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of the French province in the latter with Fathers Van Reith, S.J. and Lavigne, S.J. as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. These five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have assisting them nearly 200 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, both <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and native and the communities of Sisters of the Good Shephers, the Sisters of the Holy Family, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, Missionaries of Mary, the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03609c.htm">Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary</a>, in charge of various <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and institutions. Although Monsignor Agliardi was sent especially to establish the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, the Apostolic Delegation to the East Indies was intended to be permanent; accordingly when he departed in 1887he was succeeded by Monsignor Aiuti, who in turn was succeeded in 1892 by Monsignor Ladislaus M. Zaleski, who took up his residence at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> took steps to place the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and the supply of native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the East on a solid and more secure basis, and accordingly in 1893 a general <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was established by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, which is conducted by professors of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>, Ceylon, the students being of various nationalities and races, recruited from all parts of the East. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are on excellent terms with the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government and are held in high esteem by the people of the island generally. Their legal status, however, was not quite assured in respect of succession to <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> though no practical difficulty was experienced; but the Supreme Court of Ceylon, having recently held that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had no legal corporate capacity and could not therefore claim, merely by virtue of their office, title to <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> held by their predecessors, the legislature, in consequence of representations made to the Government on the subject, passed the Ordinance No. 19 of 1906, whereby the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and their respective successors, appointed according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and usages of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are constituted corporations sole with perpetual succession, and with full power to acquire and hold all species of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and to sue or be sued in respect of such <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in all courts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. While the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> system of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is thus complete, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> are not backward in respect to organization and public action, for in addition to various religious and social institutions they have formed an association representative of all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> under the name of "The Catholic Union of Ceylon", having for its object the protection and advancement of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. The general statistics for 1905 are: <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 592; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 570, with 45,549 pupils; <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, 5, with 174 students (in the central or "Leonianum" Seminary at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a> there are 88); <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, 16, with 975 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>; 133 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 43 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 288 religious (Oblates, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>); and 430 sisters in the various <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>.
