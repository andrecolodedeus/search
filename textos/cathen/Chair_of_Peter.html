<h2 id="section1">The annual feast of <em>cathedra petri</em> at Rome</h2>

<p><a href="../images/03551eax.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/03551eat.gif"></a>

<p>From the earliest times the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> celebrated on 18 January the memory of the day when the <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Apostle</a> held his first service with the faithful of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>. According to Duchesne and de Rossi, the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" (Weissenburg <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>) reads as follows: "XV KL. FEBO. Dedicatio cathedr&aelig; sci petri apostoli qua primo Rome petrus apostolus sedit" (fifteenth day before the calends of February, the dedication of the Chair of St. Peter the Apostle in which Peter the Apostle first sat at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>). The Epternach <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (Codex Epternacensis) of the same work, says briefly: "cath. petri in roma" (the Chair of Peter in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>).

<p>In its present (ninth-century) form the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" gives a second feast of the Chair of St. Peter for 22 February, but all the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> assign it to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, not to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Thus the oldest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, says: "VIII kal. mar. cathedr&aelig; sci petri apostoli <em>qua sedit apud antiochiam</em>". The Weissenburg <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> says: "Natl [natale] sci petri apostoli cathedr&aelig; qua sedit apud antiocia." However, the words qua sedit apud antiochiam are seen at once to be a later addition. Both feasts are Roman; indeed, that of 22 February was originally the more important. This is clear from the Calendar of Philocalus drawn up in the year 354, and going back to the year 311; it makes no mention of the January feast but speaks thus of 22 February: "VIII Kl. Martias: natale Petri de cathedra" (eighth day before the Calends of March, the birthday [i.e. feast] of the Chair of Peter). It was not until after the insertion of Antioch in the copies of the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" that the feast of February gave way in importance to that of January. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, therefore, at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> celebrated a first and a second assumption of the episcopal office in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by St. Peter. This double celebration was also held in two places, in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a> and in a cemetery (<em>coemeterium</em>) on the Via Salaria. At both places a chair (<em>cathedra</em>) was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> which the Apostle had used as presiding officer of the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The first of these chairs stood in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> built by Pope Damasus; the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> <em>in albis</em> (white <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> robes) were led from the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> seated on this ancient cathedra, and received from him the <em>consignatio</em>, i.e. the Sacrament of Confirmation. Reference is made to this custom in an inscription of Damasus which contains the line: "una Petri sedes, unum verumque lavacrum" (one Chair of Peter, one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> font of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>). St. Ennodius of Pavia (d. 521) speaks of it thus ("Libellus pro Synodo", near the end): "Ecce nunc ad gestatoriam sellam apostolic&aelig; confessionis uda mittunt limina candidatos; et uberibus gaudio exactore fletibus collata Dei beneficio dona geminantur" (Behold now the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> go from the dripping threshold to the portable chair of the Apostolic confession; amid abundant tears called forth by <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> are doubled). While therefore in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a> there stood a cathedra on which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sat amid the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> during the <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a>, there was also in the same building a second cathedra from which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> administered to the newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the Sacrament of Confirmation. The Chair of St. Peter in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> was made of marble and was built into the wall, that of the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> was movable and could be carried. Ennodius calls the latter a <em>gestatoria sedes</em>; throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was always brought on 22 February from the above-mentioned <em>consignatorium</em> or place of confirmation to the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>. That day the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not use the marble cathedra at the back of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> but sat on this movable cathedra, which was, consequently, made of wood. The importance of this <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> was heightened by the fact that 22 February was considered the anniversary of the day when Peter bore witness, by the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Sea of Tiberias</a>, to the Divinity of Christ and was again appointed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to be the Rock of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. According to very ancient Western <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, 22 February was the day "quo electus est 1. Petrus papa" (on which Peter was first chosen <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>). The Mass of this feast calls it at the beginning: "solemnitatis pr&aelig;dicand&aelig; dies pr&aelig;cipue nobilis in quo . . . . beatus Bar-Jona voce Redemptoris fide devot&acirc; pr&aelig;latus est et per hanc Petri petram basis ecclesi&aelig; fixus est", i.e. this day is called especially praiseworthy because on it the blessed Bar-Jona, by reason of his devout <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, was raised to pre-eminence by the words of the Redeemer, and through this rock of Peter was established the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And the <em>Oratio</em> (collect) says: "Deus, qui hodiern&acirc; die beatum Petrum post te dedisti caput ecclesi&aelig;, cum te ille vere confessus sit" (O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who didst this day give us as head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, after Thyself, the Blessed Peter, etc.).

<p>The second of the aforementioned chairs is referred to about 600 by an Abbot Johannes. He had been commissioned by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a> to collect in special little phials oil from the lamps which burned at the graves of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">CATACOMBS</a>; <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">MARTYR</a>) for the Lombard queen, Theodolinda. According to the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> list of these oils preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> treasury of Monza, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, one of these vessels had on it the statement: "oleo de sede ubi prius sedit sanctus Petrus" (oils from the chair where St. Peter first sat). Other ancient authorities describe the site as "ubi Petrus baptizabat" (where Peter <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>), or "ad fontes sancti Petri; ad Nymphas sancti Petri" (at the fountain of Saint Peter). Formerly this site was pointed out in the <em>coemeterium majus</em> (principal cemetery) on the Via Nomentana; it is now certain that it was on the Via Salaria, and was connected with the <em>coemeterium</em>, or cemetery, of Priscilla and the villa of the Acilii (Acilii Glabriones), situated above this <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a>. The foundation of this villa, showing masonry of a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> (<em>opus reticulatum</em>), still exists. Both villa and cemetery, in one of whose burial chambers are several epitaphs of members of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, or <em>gens</em>, of the Acilii, belong to the Apostolic Period. It is most probable that Priscilla, who gave her name as foundress to the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a>, was the wife of Acilius Glabrio, executed under <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>. There is hardly any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the site, "ubi prius sedit sanctus Petrus, ubi Petrus baptizabat" (where Saint Peter first sat, where Peter <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>), should be sought, not in an underground <em>cubiculum</em> (chamber) in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, but in an oratory above ground. At least nothing has been found in the oldest part of the cemetery of Priscilla now fully excavated, referring to a cathedra, or chair.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the <em>Cathedra Petri</em> was therefore celebrated on the Via Salaria on 18 January; in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a> it was observed on 22 February. It is easy to believe that after the triumph of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the festival could be celebrated with greater pomp in the magnificent basilica erected by <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> over the <em>confessio</em>, or grave of Peter, than in a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> far distant from the city on the Via Salaria. Yet the latter could rightly boast in its favour that it was there Saint Peter first exercised at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the episcopal office ("ubi prius sedit sanctus Petrus", as Abbot Johannes wrote, or "qua primo Rome petrus apostolus sedit", as we read in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" at 18 January). This double festival of the Chair of St. Peter is generally attributed to a long absence of the Apostle from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As, how ever, the spot, "ubi s. Petrus baptizabat, ubi prius sedit" was distant from the city, it is natural to think that the second feast of the cathedra is connected with the opening of a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> for <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a> in the city itself.
<h2 id="section2">The chair itself</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, who conquered and pillaged <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 410, advanced toward the city by the Via Salaria and the Via Nomentana; the same roads were traversed in the sixth and seventh centuries by later German invaders of Roman territory. Not only the churches, therefore, but even the cemeteries on these thoroughfares were easily given to plunder and devastation. We have seen, moreover, that as late as 600 a lamp was burning on the site "ubi prius sedit sanctus Petrus". If the original chair of the Apostle had still been there at that time, would it have been saved from destruction in the pillage that did not spare the sarcophagi in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>? The words of the Abbot Johannes, "oleo de sede, ubi prius sedit sanctus Petrus", seem to leave scarcely a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to this. The fact, evidenced by the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> (see above), that by the ninth century one of the two feasts of the Roman cathedra had drifted away to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, shows that the cathedra of the Via Salaria must have perished as early as the sixth or seventh century.

<p>We come now to the question, where stood originally the chair shown and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a> during the fourth century? On the strength of ancient tradition it has been customary to designate the church of Santa Pudenziana as the spot where, in the house of the supposed Senator Pudens, the two great Apostles not only received hospitable entertainment, but also held <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> services. But the legends connected with Santa Pudenziana do not offer sufficient guarantee for the theory that this church was the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and residence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> before Constantine. At the close of his Epistle to the Romans (xvi, 5), <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> mentions a place where religious services were held, the house of <a href="../cathen/01661a.htm">Aquila</a> and Prisca (<em>ten kat oikon auton ekklesian</em> &#151; now Santa Prisca on the Aventine). Aquila and Prisca are first among the many to whom the Apostle sends salutations. Aquila's connexion with the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Priscilla is still shown by the epitaphs of that burial place. In 1776 there was excavated on the Aventine, near the present church of Santa Prisca, a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> with frescoes of the fourth century; in these frescoes pictures of the two Apostles were still recognizable. Among the rubbish was also found a gilded glass with the figures of Peter and Paul. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the dedication of this church (an important point) still falls on the same day as the above-described cathedra feast of 22 February; this church, therefore, continued to celebrate the traditional feast even after the destruction of the object from which it sprang. In the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of Santa Prisca is shown a hollowed capital, bearing in thirteenth-century letters the inscription: BAPTISMUS SANCTI PETRI (Baptism of Saint Peter), undoubtedly the echo of an ancient tradition of the administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> here by Peter. In this way we have linked together a series of considerations which make it probable that the spot "ubi secundo sedebat sanctus Petrus" (where Saint Peter sat for the second time), must be sought in the present church of Santa Prisca; in other words, that the chair referred to by St. Damasus was kept there in the period before Constantine. It was there, consequently, that was celebrated the "natale Petri de cathedr&acirc;", set for 22 February in the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> beginning with the year 354. It follows also that this is the cathedra referred to in the oldest <em>testimonia</em> which speak of the chair from which Peter taught at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The (third-century) poem, "Adversus Marcionem", says (P.L., II, 1099): <blockquote> H&acirc;c cathedr&acirc;, Petrus qu&acirc; sederat ipse, locatum <br>Maxima Roma Linum primum considere iussit. <br> <br>(On this chair, where Peter himself had sat, <br>great <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> first placed <a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a> and bade him sit.) </blockquote>

<p>Further, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, writing about 250, during the vacancy of the chair after the death of Pope St. Fabian, describes it as follows: "Cum locus Fabiani, id est locus Petri et gradus cathedr&aelig; sacerdotalis vacaret" (when the place of Fabian, i.e. the place of Peter and the step of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> chair were vacant). Still earlier, about 200, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> writes, in his "De pr&aelig;scriptione b&aelig;reticorum": "Percurre ecclesias apostolicas, apud quas ips&aelig; adhuc cathedr&aelig; apostolorum suis locis pr&aelig;sident. Si Itali&aelig; adjaces habes Romam" (Visit the Apostolic churches in (among) which the very chairs of the Apostles still preside in their places. If you are near <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, there is <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>).

<p>How Pope Damasus might be led to transfer the <em>cathedra Petri</em> from Santa Prisca to the Vatican, can be readily understood from the circumstances of that time. From the reign of the first Constantine the Lateran had been the residence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and its magnificent basilica their <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, while the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of Constantine served for the solemn administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> on the <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">eve of Easter</a>. In the half-century from 312 to 366 (date of the accession of Damasus), the importance of Santa Prisca, its <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>, and its cathedra must naturally have declined. Damasus could therefore be certain of the approval of all <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when he transferred the venerable Apostolic <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> from the small <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in Santa Prisca to his own new <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> in the Vatican, where it certainly remained to the first quarter of the sixth century, after which it was kept in different <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was customary to exhibit it yearly to the faithful; the newly-elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was also solemnly <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> on this venerable chair, a custom that ceased at the transfer of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> capital to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, in the early part of the fourteenth century. In order to preserve for posterity this precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>, <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> (1655-67) enclosed, after the designs of <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a>, the <em>Cathedra Petri</em> above the apsidal altar of St. Peter's in a gigantic casing of bronze, supported by four <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a> (Ambrose, Augustine, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>). Thenceforth, for 200 years, it was not exhibited to the public. In 1867, however, on the occasion of the eighteenth centenary of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the two great Apostles, it was exposed for the veneration of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. At that time the Alessandri brothers photographed the chair, and that photograph is reproduced here. The seat is about one foot ten inches above the ground, and two feet eleven and seven-eighths inches wide; the sides are two feet one and one-half inches deep; the height of the back up to the tympanum is three feet five and one-third inches; the entire height of the chair is four feet seven and one-eighth inches. According to the examination then made by <a href="../cathen/06389b.htm">Padre Garucci</a> and <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">Giovanni Battista de Rossi</a>, the oldest portion (see illustration) is a perfectly plain oaken arm-chair with four legs connected by cross-bars. The wood is much worm-eaten, and pieces have been cut from various spots at different times, evidently for relics. To the right and left of the seat four strong iron rings, intended for carrying-poles, are set into the legs. At a later date, perhaps in the ninth century, this famous chair was strengthened by the addition of pieces of <a href="../cathen/01079a.htm">acacia</a> wood. The latter wood has inlaid in it a rich ornamentation of <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>. For the adornment of the front of the seat eighteen small panels of <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> have been used, on which the labours of Hercules, also fabulous animals, have been engraved; in like manner it was common at this period to ornament the covers of books and <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a> with <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> panels or carved stones representing mythological scenes. The back is divided by small columns and arches into four fields and finishes at the top in a tympanum which has for ornamentation a large round opening between two smaller ones. The tympanum is surrounded on all sides by strips of <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> engraved in arabesques. At the centre of the horizontal strip a picture of an emperor (not seen in the illustration) is carved in the <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>; it is held to be a portrait of Charles the Bald. The arabesque of <a href="../cathen/01092a.htm">acanthus</a> leaves filled with fantastic representations of animals, and the rough execution of the work, would make the period of this emperor (884) a probable date. What still remains of the old cathedra scarcely permits an opinion as to the original form. In any case it was a heavy chair made of plain, straight pieces of wood, so that it cannot be considered a <em>sella curulis</em> of Pudens, as earlier tradition held it to be. If the four rings on the two sides belong to the original chair (Ennodius of Pavia about the sixth century used the term <em>sedes gestatoria</em> as an expression universally understood in reference to this chair), then it was probably an ordinary carrying-chair, such as was commonly used in ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>While the two chairs were the visible memorials of the earliest origins of Peter's Apostolic work at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the recollection of his first arrival in the city is stil preserved in the <em>litanioe majores</em> (greater <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>) on 25 April. On this day is also celebrated the feast of St. Mark, whom St. Peter had sent to Alexandria in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Antioch and Alexandria, the two most important <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> of the East, were, in common with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, founded by Peter. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> refers as follows to this spiritual relationship with the Roman Patriarchate of the West, in a letter to the Patriarch Eulogius (P.L., LXXVII, 899): "Quum multi sint Apostoli, pro ipso autem principatu sola Apostolorum principis sedes in auctoritate convaluit, qu&aelig; in tribus locis unius est. Ipse enim sublimavit sedem, in qu&acirc; etiam quiescere et pr&aelig;sertim vitam finire dignatus est. Ipse decoravit sedem, in qu&acirc; Evangelistam (Marcum) discipulum misit. Ipse firmavit sedem, in qu&acirc; septem annis, quamvis discessurus, sedit. Quum ergo unius atque una sit sedes, cui ex auctoritate divin&acirc; tres nunc episcopi pr&aelig;sident, quidquid ego de vobis boni audio, hoc mihi imputo" (Though there are many Apostles, pre-eminence of authority belongs permanently to none other than the Chair of the Prince of the Apostles, which Chair though established in three places remains nevertheless that of one and the same [Apostle]. He lifted it to the highest dignity in the place [<a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>] where he deigned to fix his residence and end his life. He <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> it in the city [Alexandria] to which he sent his disciple, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> Mark. He strengthened it in the city [Antioch] where, though destined to depart, he sat for seven years. Since therefore the Chair in which now by divine authority three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> preside is the identical chair of the self-same [Peter], I take myself whatever good I hear concerning you).

<p>We conclude, therefore, that there is no reason for doubting the genuineness of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> preserved at the Vatican, and known as the <em>Cathedra Petri</em>. According to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> preserved the cathedra of St. James (<a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.19</a>), Alexandria that of St. Mark (G. Secchi, La cattedra alessandrina di San Marco, Venice, 1853). <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, in the above quoted passage, refers to the value placed by the Apostolic Churches on the possession of the chairs of their founders (apud quas ips&aelig; adhuc cathedr&aelig; apostolorum suis locis pr&aelig;sident), and in enumerating them he puts <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> first. Moreover, the other writers above quoted, and whose testimony reaches back to the second century, all postulate the presence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of an actual <em>Cathedra Petri</em>, See also <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">SAINT PETER</a>; <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">PRIMACY</a>.
