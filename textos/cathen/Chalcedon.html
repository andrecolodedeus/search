<h1>Chalcedon</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. The city was founded 676 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> by the <a href="../cathen/10146a.htm">Megarians</a> on the Bithynian coast, opposite the place where a little later Byzantium rose. It was captured by the Persian general Otanes after the expedition of Darius against the Scythians. Allied alternately with Athens and <a href="../cathen/14209b.htm">Sparta</a>, it became eventually a part of Bithynia, and in 74 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> passed over to the Romans, who lost it temporarily to Mithradates. In the imperial period it was a free city, but was dismantled by <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> (364-78). The <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> held it from 616 to 626. Chalcedon was the birthplace of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Xenocrates, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Beotes. The virgin St. Euphemia and her companions suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> there, probably under Galerius (305-11). It is in her magnificent church that the Fourth General Council against <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, known as the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451), was held. This church was situated on the top of the hill at Ha&#239;dar-Pasha (Haider Pasha); it was destroyed by Suleiman to build his mosque in Constantinople. Among other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who suffered at Chalcedon mention may be made of the Persian St. Sabel and his companions. Chalcedon was an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; after the great council it became a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, but without suffragans. There is a list of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a> (I, 599), completed by Anthimus Alexoudes in "Anatolikos Aster" (XXX, 108), revised for the early period by Pargoire in "Echos d'Orient" (III, 85, 204; IV, 21, 104). Among others are St. Adrian, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; St. John, Sts. Cosmas and Nicetas, during the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> period; Maris, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>; Heraclianus, who wrote against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>; Leo, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by Alexius Comnenus. The titular <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is suffragan of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>. <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a> (III, 1019) mentions eight <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, from 1345 to 1443; Eubel (I, 199; II, 141) has ten names, from 1293 to 1525. Five other <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the sixteenth century are mentioned in the "Revue b&eacute;n&eacute;dictine" (1904, 144-45, 155-56).

<p>Chalcedon is today Kadi-Keui (Kadikoi). It has about 30,000 inhabitants: 15,000 Greeks, 5000 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> (500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>), 2000 Latins, 6000 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, 2000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 200 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The Latin <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> is conducted by the <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>; they have also a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Greeks, with a Greek <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and a high school for Oriental studies, which publishes a review, the "Echos d'Orient". The <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have there a large college with commercial and elementary courses. The Dames de Sion have a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls; the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of Lourdes a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> a scholasticate. There are also public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Sisters of the Immaculate Conception have a house at Chalcedon, and the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a> a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>. Two Greek churches, one <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">English Protestant</a> church complete the list of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> institutions. At Ha&#239;dar-Pasha, the port of Kadi-Keui and head station of the Anatolian railway to <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a> have a public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and there are <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> conducted by the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, and the Oblate <a href="../cathen/02006a.htm">Sisters of the Assumption</a>, also a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and Jewish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and an English cemetery, with a monument to the soldiers who died in the Crimean War. At Famaraki (ancient Hiereia) the <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a> have a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and the Oblate <a href="../cathen/02006a.htm">Sisters of the Assumption</a> a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Near Kadi-Keui and within the limits of the Greek <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are places of interest. Scutari is the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> name of <a href="../cathen/03743a.htm">Chrysopolis</a>, a city which the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> consider sacred on account of its cemetery and its beautiful mosques. It has a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church, cared for by Georgian <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, also <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in charge of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a> and of Sisters of Charity. It was there that Licinius was defeated by Constantine (324); there also lived St. Maximus, the Confessor (580-662), the hero of the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> controversies. Tchiboukli, on the Bosphorus, is the Byzantine Irenaion, where stood the famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Ac&aelig;met&aelig;, founded by St. Marcellus; at Kalamish (the port of Eutropius) lived the stylite, St. Luke; Djadi-Bostan is the ancient Rufiniana, where the famous councils <em>Ad Quercum</em> were held in 397 and 403. In the vicinity were the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of St. Hypatius and St. John. On the Kaish-Dagh lived St. Auxentius, St. Bendidianus, and St. Stephen, and at Touzla (Cape Acritas) St. Athanasius of Paulopetrion and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>. Finally, in full view of Kadi-Keui, are the celebrated Prince's Islands, with their numberless political and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> associations.
