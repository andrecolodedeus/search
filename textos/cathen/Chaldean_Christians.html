<h1>Chaldean Christians</h1>  

<p>The name of former <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> now reunited with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Ethnologically they are divided into two groups (Turco-Persian and Indian), which must be treated apart, since in their vicissitudes one group differs considerably from the other. The first group is usually known as Chaldeans, the second as <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Christians of St. Thomas</a> (also called the Syro-Malabar Church).
<h2 id="section1">Name and territory of Chaldeans</h2>

<p>Strictly, the name of <em>Chaldeans</em> is no longer correct; in Chaldea proper, apart from Baghdad, there are now very few adherents of this rite, most of the Chaldean population being found in the cities of <a href="../cathen/08626b.htm">Kerkuk</a>, Arbil, and Mosul, in the heart of the Tigris valley, in the valley of the Zab, in the mountains of Kurdistan. It is in the former <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Ator (Assyria) that are now found the most flourishing of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Chaldean communities. The native population accepts the name of Atoraya-Kaldaya (Assyro-Chaldeans) while in the neo-Syriac vernacular <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> generally are known as Syrians. The territory now occupied by these Chaldeans belonged once to the ancient Sassanid Empire of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, later Omayyad and then the Abbassid caliphs of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> and Mongol invasions, and later efforts to reconstruct the former Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> shattered effectually the earlier political unity of this region; since the end of the sixteenth century the territory of the Chaldeans has been under <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> or Persian rule. In fact, however, a number of the mountain tribes are only nominally subject to either.
<h2 id="section2">Chaldeans in Turkey and Persia</h2>

<p>From the fifth century, the Persian Church quietly, almost unconsciously, adopted the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Previous to that period, its relations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had been insignificant owing to distance, language, racial temper, and a certain ardour of nationalism begotten by the almost perpetual <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the Roman Empire. Up to the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, there also lay between <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> another, and insuperable, obstacle: The <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>.

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that at the end of seventh century a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, Sahdona, accepted the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> and returned to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, but this implied only a renewal of union with the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> (Orthodox Greek) Church of Antioch and the East, by no means a recognition of the supremacy of the Pope of Old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The present Chaldeans do not therefore descend from Sahdona.

<p>It was not until the thirteenth century that the political revolutions of Central and Farther <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> permitted closer relations between the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian Christians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, whose missionaries then reached the valley of the Tigris by way of the <a href="../cathen/08361a.htm">new Latin principalities</a>. <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, an earnest promoter of the Eastern missions, had sent two <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> to Sabhrisho' ibn-al-Masih, the <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. Through his vicar Ard (perhaps Addai) the <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatise by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, Iso'yahb bar Malkon (1247). The result of this mission is unknown; certainly Makkika and Denha, successors of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a>, pursued the matter no further. Yahbalaha III, however, elected in 1281, sent to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in his own name and in that of Argun, King of the Tatars, the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Barsauma (1287). <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> welcomed the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> envoy and sent him home with many gifts for the <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a>, requesting kind treatment for such <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missionaries as might traverse his province.

<p>In 1304 the same Yahbalaha took advantage of the return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> James to address to <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a> a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> dated from the city of Maraga. The frightful disturbances of the fourteenth century interrupted these friendly relations. Towards the middle of the fifteenth century the office of <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a> became hereditary and passed from uncle to nephew in the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> communities, dispersed throughout the former Arabian Empire, cut off from all communication with their natural religious centre, dwindled to insignificant proportions or disappeared altogether. In 1445 Andreas, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04131a.htm">Coloss&aelig;</a>, was sent by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> to reconcile with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> Timothy, known as the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, but then resident in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. After obtaining from this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> certain modifications of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Liturgy, Andreas forbade the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> to treat the Chaldeans as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.

<p>In 1551 the <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> Simeon bar Mama was succeeded by his nephew, Simeon Denha. According to a custom then about a century old, the latter was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Henanisho, the only remaining <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. A numerous anti-synod met at Mosul, convoked by the Bishops of Arbil, Salamas, and Aderbaidjan. In agreement with the principal <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> they chose for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rabban-Hormizd Se' ud bar Daniel, known as Sulaga (Ascension). Probably at the suggestion of some Latin missionary, they sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> from <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>, with the title of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the Chaldeans. On his return to his country Sulaga <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> two <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In the meantime, the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a>, Simeon Denha, won over the Pasha of Diarbekir; John Sulaga was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and later on (1555) was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. The united Chaldeans soon chose as his successor Abdisho', the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Djeziret ibn-Omar (Beit-Zabdai'), who went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1562) during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, received there the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, and was invited to assist at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. He declined this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> but addressed to the assembly a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that was read at the twenty-second session. He returned to his people, and after a few years died among them at Seert (1567). The patriarchal office remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for some time. Though very little as known of Aitalaha, the successor of Abdisho', it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he did not go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, as did his predecessors. His energetic auxiliary, however, Hormizd-Elias Amas Abid, who had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Sulaka as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Amid and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, was always in friendly communication with the Latins. In the meantime a large body of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> headed by Denha Simeon, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Gelu, Salamas, and Seert, rejected the authority of the successor of bar Mama and submitted to Aitalaha, on whose death Simeon was chosen to succeed him. The Turco-Persian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> Simeon to reside in the mountains, near Salamas in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, whereas his predecessors had resided at Amid (Amida). This change of residence had important consequences: the successors of Simeon in the end retained <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> only over the provinces subject to the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, and had no longer any intercourse with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> except at long intervals. In this way many Chaldeans returned to the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (if, indeed, they had ever abandoned it). Simeon died in 1593. In 1619 his successor, Simeon II, wrote that he should visit <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which promise, however, he was unable to execute. In 1650 Simeon III corresponded with <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>. In 1658 Simeon IV entered on relations with the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>, for which attitude his subjects tried to depose him. <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, however, defended him earnestly in a letter to the King of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and urged that he might be permitted to retain his patriarchal office. There is still extant a letter of Simeon V (1670) to <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, also one of Simeon VI (1770) to <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a>. Since the election of Simeon VII (1839) no further attempts have been made by the Chaldeans of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> to renew relations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The establishment (1837) of a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> mission near Urmia probably accounts for this regrettable attitude. Nevertheless, the present <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> patriarch, resident at Kotchannes in the mountains of Kurdistan, is a direct successor of John Sulaga, one of those who initiated the aforesaid union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.



<p>Simeon bar Mama was succeeded in 1576 by Elias Simeon Venha who in 1586 sent a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. It was, however, judged <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. Elias II (1591-1617) took up again the question of reunion and in a letter to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1610) complained that he and his people were regarded as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of the Holy Land. In 1616 he assembled at Amid (Diarbekir) a general synod, attended by eight <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and in which Padre Tommaso da Novara, superior of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, took part. In preparation for this synod an embassy had been sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1612) headed by the <a href="../cathen/01695c.htm">archimandrite</a>, Addai. The union was consummated, but in appearance only. Two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> appeared to have been sincere in their conversion: Addai, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at the aforesaid synod as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Amid and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and (perhaps) the patriarch. The latter, however, died the following year. His successor, Elias (III) Simeon (1617-1660) also solicited from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> but his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was not found <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. The negotiations soon ceased and were not resumed either by Elias (IV) John (1600-1700), or by Elias (V) (1700-1723). It is said that Elias (VI) Denha (1723-1778) corresponded with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. If so his successor, Elias (VII) Ishotyahb, observed an attitude of independence. Finally, John Hormizd &#151; the last descendant of the patriarchal <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of bar Mama &#151; went over definitely to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (1830) and took with him the See of Baghdad-Mosul and many <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>.

<p>In 1672, Joseph, the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Diarbekir, following the advice of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> missionaries, withdrew from communion with the Patriarch Elias IV. The latter tried to have him assassinated and roused against him the vigorous enmity of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> authorities. Joseph fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1675), but after an understanding with the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, and with the sanction of <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, returned to his own country where he was active in organizing the union of his people with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> granted him the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> (1681) and the title of patriarch. He resigned in 1693 and died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The learned Joseph (II) Ma'aruf (1693-1713), received from <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> (1701) the title of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Babylon. His successor, Joseph (III) Moses Timothy (1714-1756), had a very troubled career. In 1731 he went to Constantinople to protest against the incessant annoyances of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. Thence he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he promptly received an intimation to return to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was unable, however, to reach it and appeared again in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1735), where for six years he was kept in seclusion. At the end of this period he was restored, at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of his flock, and returned to Amid (1741), where he died in 1756. Joseph (IV) Timothy (1759-1779) followed him in the patriarchal office. Joseph (V) Augustine Hindi succeeded (1779-1826) with the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and Administrator of the Chaldean Patriarchate of the Province of Diarbekir, for the Diocese of Mosul he had as auxiliary the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> George of Alkosch. Owing to the scarcity of documents the history of this period is little known. From letters edited by Giamil (Genuinae relationes, 391-399) it would appear that properly speaking Joseph IV had no successor, perhaps because of the aforementioned conversion to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> of John Hormizd, the last descendant of bar Mama. John Hormizd had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> in 1818, but was reconciled with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1830 and proclaimed <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Babylon by <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a>; he owed this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> settlement to the kind efforts of Pierre Coupperie, the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Babylon. In 1838 Nicholas Isaias Jacob, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aderbaidjan, and a former pupil of the College of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was appointed his coadjutor with right of succession. The same year John Hormizd died, and in 1847 Isaias Jacob resigned. His successor, Joseph (VI) Audo (1848-1878), entered on a serious conflict with <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. Though the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Reversurus" had provoked (1867) a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, it was imposed upon the Chaldeans in 1869. Joseph Audo maintained his prerogative in the matter of episcopal ordinations and was threatened with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of September, 1876. Audo died in 1878, but had previously been reconciled with <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> appointed as his successor Elias (XII) Abolionan (1878-1894), who was followed by the learned George 'Abdisho' (V) Khayyath (1894-1899) and Joseph Emmanuel (II) Thomas.
<h2 id="section3">Present status</h2>

<p>The latest and most complete Statistics of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Chaldeans were furnished in 1896 by Mgr. George 'Abdisho' Khayyath to the Abb&eacute; Chabot (Revue de l'Orient Chr&eacute;tien, I, no. 4). The patriarch considers Baghdad as the principal city of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. His title of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Babylon results from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> identification (in the seventeenth century) of modern Baghdad with ancient Babylon. As a matter of fact the Chaldean patriarch resides habitually at Mosul and reserves for himself the direct administration of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and that of Baghdad. There are five <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> (resident respectively at Bassora, Diarbekir, <a href="../cathen/08626b.htm">Kerkuk</a>, Salamas, and Urmia) and seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Eight patriarchal vicars govern the small Chaldean communities dispersed throughout Turkey and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. The Chaldean <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Rabban-Hormizd, have established some missionary stations in the mountain districts inhabited by <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. Three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, the others in Turkey. There are in all 233 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 177 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Chaldean Clergy number 248 priests; they are assisted by the religious of the Congregation of St. Hormizd (Rabban-Hormizd) who number about one hundred. There are about fifty-two Chaldean <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (not counting those conducted by Latin <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and missionaries). At Mosul there is a patriarchal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, distinct from the Syro-Chaldean <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> directed by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. The total number of the Chaldeans according to the above-mentioned authority is nearly 78,000, 24,000 of whom are in the Diocese of Mosul. This number is perhaps a little exaggerated. The figure of about 66,000 given by Dr. Oussani (see <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">ASIA</a>) as against 140,000 <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> is more correct. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language of the Chaldean Church is Syriac. Arabic, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>, Kurd are variously spoken by the people; in some districts the vernacular is neo-Syriac. The <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> are those of the ancient <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church, corrected in the sense of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. Unfortunately, without <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> necessity, they have in some places been made to conform with Latin usage.

<p>Religiously and morally the Chaldeans are on a level with the other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communities of the Oriental Rite. They are becoming daily better instructed, owing in part to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and devotion of Latin missionaries and religious (Dominicans at Mosul, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at Baghdad, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>). Their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> counts among its members such learned men, as Mgr. Giamil, Mgr. Addai Scher, and Mgr. <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">Manna</a>, authors of numerous publications interesting to <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalists</a>. This literary revival is mostly due to the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>, Pere Bedjan, a <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> Chaldean. He devoted much industry and learning to popularizing among his people, both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, their ancient chronicles, the lives of Chaldean <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, even works of the ancient <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Malabar Christians</h2>

<p>The west coast of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> exhibits since the sixth century a number of flourishing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities subject to the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. In the sixteenth century Portuguese invaders of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> found on the aforesaid coast over 200,000 of these ancient Persian or Syriac <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who called themselves <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Christians of St. Thomas</a>. They acknowledged their dependence on the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church for a long time, however, on account of the dangers of travel and continual <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, their intercourse with it was only intermittent. Most of the time, therefore, they were without <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> tried to annex them by a process of latinization, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, successors of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, followed a similar policy, but with much moderation and practical sense.

<p>After the above described renewal of relations between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Chaldean <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, their <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, Bishop Hormizd Elias, was sent to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (1562) by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Patriarch 'Abdisho', with two <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missionaries, one of whom was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. 'Abdisho' <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a> a certain Joseph whom the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> detained at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> so that he was able to reach his mission only after two years. In the meantime, because of urgency, a successor had been named, Bishop Abraham of Angamale. This was the cause of misunderstandings and disputes to which <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> put an end (1565) by dividing the Malabar territory. This step did not greatly relieve the anxieties of the United Chaldeans of Malabar. Bishop Abraham complained to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> "that the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society [of Jesus]</a> and the Latin Portuguese tried to withdraw him from obedience to the Chaldean patriarch and to persuade him to demand the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> directly from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In this way they sought to compel him to "conform to the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> and to turn over gradually to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the administration of this province". The King of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> himself asked from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (1576) for Bishop Abraham a safe-conduct to attend at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of the Indies, without fear of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. In 1599, Alexis Menezes, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, convoked at Diamper a celebrated synod, in which it was decided to unify the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and to correct the rituals, <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missals</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Malabar Christians</a> in the sense of the Roman Liturgy. Portuguese authority enforced these decisions on the Malabar Coast, but the policy eventually failed. Many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> left the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> and joined the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. A little later (1603) the Jacobite (<a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>) patriarch sent a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, whereupon more than a hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Malabar Christians</a> accepted him with a view to the preservation of their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> (Syriac) tongue, heedless of his <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, which was, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> quite unintelligible to them. Owing to the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> missionaries, who succeeded the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, nearly 250,000 persevered in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, and have remained to the present, loyal to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and submissive to the Latin <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> though they have never ceased their petition to be restored to the obedience of the Chaldean patriarch. This re-affiliation has not been accorded them, even after the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> "Orientalium Dignitas". The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, has withdrawn them from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and has given them three <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> of their nation and rite. These native <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> administer the Dioceses of Trichur, <a href="../cathen/16038a.htm">Ernakulam</a> and Changanachery, and are directly subject to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (1897). This is only a provisional solution. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Chaldeans of Malabar look always towards the (Catholic) Chaldean <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, who never tire of urging the extension of their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the distant Malabar churches, historically united with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and its legitimate representatives.
