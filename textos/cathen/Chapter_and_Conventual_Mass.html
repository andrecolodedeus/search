<h1>Chapter and Conventual Mass</h1>  

<p>As a general rule, churches in which the Divine office is to be said publicly every day must also have Mass said daily. This Mass is the "conventual" Mass (<em>missa conventualis</em>); it completes, with the canonical Hours, the official public service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such a church. A conventual Mass then is to be sung or said in all <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> and collegiate churches that have a chapter; in this case it is often called the "chapter" Mass (<em>missa capituli</em>), though the official books constantly use the general name "conventual" for this Mass too. A conventual (not chapter) Mass must also be celebrated daily in churches of regulars who have the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the public recitation of the office, therefore certainly in churches of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and canons regular. Whether <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant friars</a> have this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is disputed. Some authors consider them <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, others admit only whatever <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> they may have from their special constitutions or from custom. Some extend the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> even to churches of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who say the office in choir. That <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> may celebrate a daily conventual Mass according to the rule of monastic churches is admitted by every one (de Herdt., I, 14). A chapter Mass then is a kind of conventual Mass, and falls under the same rules.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of procuring the conventual Mass rests with the corporate body in question and so concerns its superiors (Dean, Provost, Abbot, etc.). Normally it should be said by one of the members, but the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is satisfied as long as some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who may celebrate lawfully undertakes it. The conventual Mass should always, if possible, be a high Mass; but if this is impossible, low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> is still treated as a high Mass with regard to the number of collects said, the candles, absence of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> at the end, and so on. It may not be said during the recitation of the office, but at certain fixed times between the canonical Hours, as is explained below. The general rule is that the conventual Mass should correspond to the office with which it forms a whole. It is not allowed to sing two high Masses both conformed to the office on the same day. On the other hand, there are cases in which two different conventual Masses are celebrated. The cases in which the Mass does not correspond to the office are these: on Saturdays in <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> (except Ember Saturday and a Vigil), if the office is <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> the Mass is of the Blessed Virgin. On Vigils in <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> that are not also Ember days, if the office is <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> the Mass is of the Vigil commemorating the feria. On <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> the Mass does not conform to the office. On Rogation Tuesday, if the office is <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> the Mass is of Rogation. On Whitsun Eve the office is of the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a>, but the Mass a Whitsun Mass. When a Vigil, an Ember day or Rogation Monday falls within an octave (except that of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>) the office is of the octave, and the Mass of the feria commemorating the octave. Except in <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, on Ember days, Rogation days and Vigils, if the office is <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> and the Sunday Mass has already been said that week, the conventual Mass may be one of the Votive Masses in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> appointed for each day in the week. Except in <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Paschal time</a>, on the first day of the month not prevented by a double or semi-double, the conventual Mass is a Requiem for deceased members and benefactors of the community.

<p>On doubles, semi-doubles <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, and during octaves, the conventual Mass is said after <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, on simples and <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferias</a> after Sext, on <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferias</a> of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, on Vigils and Ember days after None. There are also occasions on which several conventual Masses are said on the same day. On <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferias</a> of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, on Ember days, Rogation days and Vigils when a double or semi-double occurs, or during an octave or when a Votive office is said, the Mass corresponding to the office is said after <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, that of the feria after None. On <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a> eve, if a double or semi-double occurs, the Mass of the feast is said after <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, that of the Vigil after Sext, that of Rogation after None. In the case of the conventual Requiem mentioned above, if a simple occurs or if the Mass of the preceding Sunday has not yet been said, the Requiem is celebrated after the <a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>, or if that is not said, after Prime, the Mass of the simple or Sunday after Sext. On All Souls' day (2 Nov.) the Mass of the octave (or feast) is said after <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, the Requiem after None. When an additional Votive Mass has to be said (for instance for the Forty Hours or for the anniversary of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> or <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthronement</a>, etc.) It is said after None. On the Monday of each week (except in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Paschal time</a>) if the office is <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> the conventual Mass may be a Requiem. But if it is a simple or a feria with a proper Mass, or if the Sunday Mass has not been said, the collect for the dead (<em>Fidelium</em>) is added to that of the day instead. These rules concerning the celebration of two or more conventual Masses apply as <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> only to chapters. Regulars are not bound to celebrate more than one such Mass each day (corresponding always to the office), unless the particular constitutions of their order impose this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>.
