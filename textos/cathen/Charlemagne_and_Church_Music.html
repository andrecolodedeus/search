<h1>Charlemagne and Church Music</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> interest in <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> and solicitude for its propagation and adequate performance throughout his empire, have never been equalled by any civil ruler either before or since his time. Great as was his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Pepin's care for the song of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Charles's activity was <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> more intelligent and comprehensive. Aided by a technical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the subject, he appreciated the reasons why the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> attaches so much importance to music in her cult and the manner of its performance. He used all his authority to enforce the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which he had made his own. The key-note of his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> on this subject, as on every other point regarding the liturgy, was conformity with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. To this end, tradition tells us, he not only took members of his own <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with him, in order that they might learn at the fountain head, but begged <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a>, in 774, to let him have two of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> singers. One of these <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chanters, Theodore, was sent to <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, and the other, Benedict, to the <em>schola cantorum</em> at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>. According to Ekkehart IV, a chronicler of the tenth century of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Gall, the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent two more singers to the Court of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. One of these, Peter, reached Metz, but Romanus at first being detained at St. Gall by sickness, afterwards obtained permission from the emperor to remain there, and it is to the presence in St. Gall and elsewhere, of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that we owe the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> without which a return to the original form of the <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a> would be impossible. The great Charles made strenuous though not wholly successful efforts to wean <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and its environs from their Ambrosian Rite and melodies. In 789 he addressed a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to the whole <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of his empire, enjoining on every member to learn the <em>Cantus Romanus</em> and to perform the office in conformity with the directions of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> (Pepin), who for the sake of uniformity with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the whole (Western) Church, had abolished the Gallican chant. Through the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> in 803, the emperor commanded anew the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to sing the office <em>sicut psallit ecclesia Romana</em>, and ordered them to establish <em>scholae cantorum</em> in suitable places, while he himself provided for the support of those already in existence that is, those in <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Paris, <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, and Dijon in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and those of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>, and St. Gall. The sons of nobles of his empire and of his vassals were expected, by imperial commands to be instructed in grammar, music, and arithmetic, while the boys in the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were taught music and how to sing, especially the Psalms. The emperor's agents and representatives were everywhere ordered to watch over the faithful carrying out of his orders regarding music. He not only caused <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> music to flourish in his own time throughout his vast domain, but he laid the foundations for musical culture which are still potent today.
