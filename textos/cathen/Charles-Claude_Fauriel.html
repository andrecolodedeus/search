<h1>Charles-Claude Fauriel</h1>  

<p>A historian, b. at St-Etienne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 27 October, 1772; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>,15 July, 1844. He studied first at the Oratorian College of Tournon, then at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. He served in the army of the Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es-Orientales. Under the Directory Fouche, an ex-Oratorian, attached him to his cabinet as private secret secretary. Under the Empire, he refused office in order to devote all his time to study. Fauriel adopted the new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the Philosophers and the principles of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, but repudiated them in part in the later years of his life. He was an intense worker and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Greek, Latin, Italian, German, English, Sanskrit, and Arabic. It was he who made the merits of Ossian and <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a> known to the French public and spread in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German literature</a>, which had been previously looked upon as unimportant. He was one of the first to investigate Romance literature, and the originality of his views in this direction soon popularized this new study. He also gathered the remnants of the ancient Basque and Celtic languages. The first works he published were a translation of "La Parth&eacute;n&eacute;ide" (Paris, 1811), an idyllic epic by the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> poet, Baggesen, and of the tragedy of his friend <a href="../cathen/09634a.htm">Manzoni</a>, "ll Conte di Carmagnola" (Paris, 1823). The numerous linguistic and archaeological contributions which he wrote for various magazines won for him a great reputation among scholars; it was said of him that "he was the man of the nineteenth century who put in circulation the most <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, inaugurated the greatest number of branches of study, and gathered the greatest number of new results in historical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>" (Revue des Deux Mondes, 15 Dec., 1853). The publication of the "Chants populaires de la Grece moderne", text and translation (Paris, 1824-25), at a moment when Greece was struggling for her independence, made him known to the general public. In 1880 a chair of foreign literature was created for him at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. He studied specially the Southern literatures and Provencal poetry. His lectures were published after his death under the title of "Histoire de la po&eacute;sie proven&ccedil;ale" (3 vols, Paris, 1846). In order to study more deeply the origins of French civilization he wrote "Histoire de la Gaule m&eacute;ridionale sous la domination des conqu&eacute;rants germains" (4 vols., Paris, 1836), only a part of a vaster work conceived by him. The merit of these works <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be elected (1836), the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres. He contributed also to the "Histoire Litt&eacute;raire de la France", commenced by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and taken after the Revolution by the Institute of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Having been named assistant curator of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of Royal Library he published an historical poem in Provencal verse (with a translation and introduction), dealing with the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>.
