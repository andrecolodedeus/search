<h1>Charles-Emile Freppel</h1>  

<p>Born at Ober-Ehnheim, Alsace, 1 June, 1827; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 22 Dec., 1891. He was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; and deputy from Finist&egrave;re. He began his studies at a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the little town; and at seventeen he had received his baccalaureate degree, and entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> Strasburg, where he received the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> at the hands of Mgr. Roess in 1848, and was at once appointed to the chair of history. Subsequent to his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1849, he took a noteworthy part in the discussions of <a href="../cathen/02677a.htm">Bonnetty</a> and Maret on the subject of traditionalism. He passed a brilliant examination which secured for him the degree of doctor at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, and after a competitive examination he was named <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the church of Ste-Genevi&egrave;ve at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Here he delivered a course of sermons on the "Divinity of Jesus Christ" which have since been published in book form. He conducted <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> exercises at the Madeleine and St-Louis d' Antin, at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, and St. Germain l' Auxerrois. His early discourses were published in 1869, in two volumes. Having been appointed to the chair of sacred eloquence at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, he conducted a series of scholarly studies on the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> apologists. They fill ten volumes (4th ed., Paris, 1885). In 1867 <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> invited him to preach the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons at the Tuileries, and these discourses have been published in a volume entitled "La Vie Chr&eacute;tienne".

<p>It was about this time that Renan's "Vie de J&eacute;sus" provoked such a storm of controversy. Mgr. Freppel published a reply to the work, his "Examen critique de la Vie de J&eacute;sus de M. Renan" (Paris, 1863), which was perhaps the best refutation of the theories expounded by the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinker</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who was then making preparations for the Council of the Vatican, summoned the Abb&eacute; Freppel to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assist in the work of drawing up the <em>schemata</em> (drafts of decrees). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> thus showed his appreciation of Freppel's learning and accomplishments, and appointed him to the Bishopric of Angers, rendered vacant by the death of Mgr. Angebault. He received the episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 April, 1870. Later there was shown a disposition to elevate him to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Chambery; but he declined with the same modesty which in 1885, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to implore those, who, with M. Jules Ferry, desired his elevation to the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, to discontinue their efforts on his behalf. Upon his return from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he proved himself, by his defense of his country, as good a patriot as at the council he had shown himself as able <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>.

<p>In 1871, he accepted the candidature for one of the electoral divisions of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He was defeated because of the ill will which the liberals had borne him since the council, at which, according to them, he had shown himself too ultramontane. In 1880, the electors of Finistere asked him to act as the representative, he was elected by a large majority to this position of trust. His first speech in the French Chamber was a vigorous protest against the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. For eleven years the bishop-deputy (<em>eacute;v&ecirc;que d&eacute;put&eacute;</em>) was the most attentively-heard orator in the Chamber, treating with equal authority the most diverse subjects, and such as would seem farthest removed from his ordinary studies. While he did not bring about the triumph of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the extent he desired, he defended it nobly though running <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> counter to the prejudices of that assembly. He won even the esteem of his enemies, and M. Floquet was one day was able to re-echo the plaudits not only of the Chamber but of the whole of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. His "OEuvres pol&eacute;miques" and his "Oratoires" have been collected in seventeen volumes (Paris, 1869-88). Almost all the great religious, political, and social questions which engaged men's minds at that time are here treated. Amongst his numerous other writings should be mentioned his work on the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> (Paris, 1889), and "Bossuet et l'&eacute;loquence sacr&eacute;e au XVII si&egrave;cle", (Paris, 1894).
