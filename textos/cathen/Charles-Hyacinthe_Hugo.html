<h1>Charles-Hyacinthe Hugo</h1>  

<p>Born 20 Sept., 1667, at St. Mihiel (Department of Meuse, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>); died 2 August, 1739. He entered the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, where he pronounced his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> on 28 Aug., 1685, receiving the name of Louis in religion. He went through his course of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Abbey of Jovillier, near Bar-le-Duc, and afterwards at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, where he graduated as Doctor of Theology in 1690 or 1691. Having taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the Abbey of Jandeures, and later in that of Etival in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, he was named <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of St. Joseph's at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> in 1700, where he remained until 1713, although in 1708 he had been elected coadjutor of the Abbey of Flab&eacute;mont, then held <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> by Nicholas Brisacier, doctor of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>. On 12 August, 1710, Hugo was chosen coadjutor to Simeon Godin, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Etival (Stivagium), and the choice having been ratified by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, he was installed with the title of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fontaine-Andr&eacute;, a suppressed <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, by the Prince-Bishop of Basle, on 23 July, 1712. Ten years later Abbot Simeon resigned the direction of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and Hugo was unanimously elected in his place, 22 October, 1722. Though now at the head of one of the largest <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, Hugo found time to co-ordinate the numerous documents he had collected and the notes he had made with a view to the publication of three of his most important works, the "Sacr&aelig; antiquitatis monumenta", the "Annales Ordinis Pr&aelig;monstratensis", and the "History of Lorraine". In order to give his personal attention to their publication, he even, favoured the erection of printing presses at Etival itself.

<p>A regrettable conflict respecting the right of exemption which the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Etival claimed for his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> arose at that time between the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul. The cause was brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where Cardinal Lercari, secretary of state, warmly upheld the contention of Hugo. In order to put an end to this lamentable incident <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> named Hugo <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ptolemais <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em> in the consistory of 15 Dec., 1728.

<p>Hugo had long planned to write a full and detailed history of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Order, and in 1717 the general chapter of the order had encouraged him to carry out his plan by naming him historiographer of the order and by requesting all the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> to give him all the information they possessed concerning their <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. The first two volumes of the "Annales" had already been published and the third was in the hands of the royal censor when Hugo died.

<p>That Hugo was a strenuous, learned, and conscientious worker may be judged from the number and the importance of the books he has published or prepared for publication. His style is elegant and harmonious, and, as Aug. Digot says with reference to the "History of Lorraine", it surpasses that of <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Dom Calmet</a>, whose style is heavy and diffuse. In 1699 Hugo published a "Refutation of the system of Faydit on the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>"; it was a solid work, according to Paquot. He is also the author of some books on the Order of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a>, one of which is favourably referred to by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>; likewise of several dissertations on seals, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, or medals, on <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and historical matters appertaining to the ducal house of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>. On 17 March, 1708, he was made by Duke Leopold a member of his privy council and requested to write the history of Lorraine. Hugo set to work with his usual energy and the work was ready in 1713, but Leopold, fearing that, owing to Hugo's previous writings, this history might too much displease the royal house of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, asked <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Dom Calmet</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Senones, to write the history instead of Hugo. Hugo's "Vie de St. Norbert, fondateur des Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;s" (Luxembourg, 1704) is remarkable for the elegance of its style and the important documents it contains. His two monumental works are: <ul><li>(1) "Sacr&aelig; antiquitatis monumenta historica, dogmatica, diplomatica, notis illustrata", in two volumes. The first volume was published in 1725; the second, after Hugo's death, in 1744; <li>(2) "Sacri et Canonici Ordinis Pr&aelig;monstratensis Annales", in two volumes, giving in alphabetical order the history of each <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>.</ul>

<p>There are two more volumes of <em>probationes</em>, such as charters, etc., respecting each <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The third volume, with the title "Annales Ordinis Pr&aelig;monstratensis S&aelig;culum Primum (1120-1220)", which was to be followed by four more volumes, was ready for the press when Hugo died. After Hugo's death the Abbey of Etival was given <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul, and for one reason or another the third volume has, unfortunately, never been printed. Hugo's <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, forming eighteen volumes in folio, each of from 500 to 600 pages, are now preserved in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>. They are fully described by M. Vacant, professor at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, in "La Biblioth&egrave;que du Grand S&eacute;minaire de Nancy" (1897).
