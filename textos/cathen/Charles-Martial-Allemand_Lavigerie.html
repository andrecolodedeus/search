<h1>Charles-Martial-Allemand Lavigerie</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, b. at Huire near <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a>, 13 Oct., 1825; d. at <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>, 27 Nov., 1892. He studied at the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Larressore, then went to St. Nicolas-du-Chardonnet in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and finally to St. Sulpice. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> on 2 June, 1849, he devoted the first year of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to higher studies at the newly founded Ecole des Carmes, taking at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> the doctorates of letters (1850), and of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> (1853), to which he added later the Roman doctorates of civil and canon law. Appointed <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of Sainte-Genevi&#232;ve in 1853, associate professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> in 1854, and titular of the chair in 1857, Lavigerie did not confine his activity to his chaplaincy or chair, but took a leading part in the organization of the students' cercles catholiques, and of l'&aelig;uvre des &eacute;coles d'Orient. As director of the latter he collected large sums for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Christians</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the Druses, and even went to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> to superintend personally the distribution of the funds (1860). His brilliant services were rewarded by rapid promotion, first in 1861 to the Roman Rota, and two years later to the <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">See of Nancy</a>. From the beginning of his episcopate he displayed that genius of organization which is the characteristic of his life. The foundation of colleges at Vic, Blamont, and Lun&eacute;ville; the establishment at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> of a higher institute for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and of a Maison d'&eacute;tudiants for law students; the organization of the episcopal curia; the publication of the "Recueil des Ordonnances &eacute;piscopales statuts et r&#232;glements du dioc&#232;se de Nancy", were but the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first fruits</a> of a promising episcopate, when he was transferred to Algiers on 27 March, 1867.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a> he promptly reversed the policy of neutrality towards the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> imposed upon his predecessors by the French authorities, and inaugurated a strong movement of assimilation and conversion. With the help of the <a href="../cathen/15613d.htm">White Fathers</a> and of the White Sisters, whom he founded for the purpose, he established and maintained at great cost <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and agricultural settlements, wherein the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> could be brought under the influence of the Gospel. Appointed as early as 1868 <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> of Western Sahara and the Sudan, he began in 1874 the work of southward expansion which was to bring his heroic missionaries into the very heart of the Dark Continent, and result in the erection of five <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> in Equatorial Africa. To those many burdens &#151; made heavier by the consequences (felt even in Algeria) of the Franco-Prussian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the withdrawal of government financial support, and the threatened extension to the African colonies of anti-religious legislation passed in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> &#151; Lavigerie added other cares: the administration of the Diocese of Constantina, 1871; the foundation at St. Anne of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the Oriental missions, 1878, and, after the occupation of <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a> by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the government of that vicariate. <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> in 1881, he became the first <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of the newly restored See of Carthage in 1884, retaining meanwhile the See of <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>. "I shall not seek one day's rest" was the remark of Lavigerie when he landed on African soil. He carried out that promise to the letter. While Notre-Dame d'Afrique at <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>, the Basilica of St. Louis at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> at <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a> will stand as monuments of his prodigious activity in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, his labours ranged far beyond the vast territories placed under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Klein (Le Cardinal Lavigerie, p. 268) describes minutely the many ways in which he served the best interests of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in, and out of, Africa. He will, however, be best remembered by the leading r&ocirc;le he played in furthering the policy of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, with regard to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and in promoting the anti-slavery movement.

<p>Tinctured with Gallicanism through his early association with the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, Lavigerie modified his views during his stay at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and his attitude at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> is fully expressed by the promise he made his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> "to be with Peter". When <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, by his Encyclicals "Nobilissima Gallorum gens" of 8 Feb., 1884, and "Sapienti&aelig; &aelig;tern&aelig;" of 3 Feb., 1890, directed the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to rally to the Republic, he generously put aside other political affiliations and again "was with Peter". A great sensation was created when at <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>, on 12 Nov., 1890, he proclaimed before a vast assemblage of French officials the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of sincerely adhering to the republican form of government. The famous "toast d'Alger" was the object of harsh criticism and even vituperation from the monarchist element. With his usual vehemence Cardinal Lavigerie answered by his "Lettre &#224; un catholique", in which he not only impugned the pretenders &#151; the Comte de Chambord, the Comte de Paris, and Prince Napol&eacute;on &#151; but even hinted that monarchy was an outgrown institution. In this he may have gone too far, but in the main point it was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> later by Cardinal Rampolla's letter of 28 November, 1890, and Pope Leo's <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Inter innumeras" of 16 Feb., 1892, that Lavigerie had been the self-sacrificing spokesman of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>The suppression of slavery had been the subject of Lavigerie's first pastoral letter at <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>. When <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> (5 May, 1888) appealed to the world in behalf of the slaves, the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Carthage was the first to respond. In spite of age and infirmities he visited the capitals of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, telling of the horrors of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> slavery and urging the formation of anti-slavery <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. The international "Conf&eacute;rence" of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 1890, practically adopted Lavigerie's suggestions as to the best means of achieving the desired abolition, and the "Congr&eacute;sde Paris", called the same year by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> himself, showed great enthusiasm and verified Lavigerie's saying: "pour sauver l'Afrique int&eacute;rieure, il faut soulever la col&#232;re du monde."

<p>After the "toast d'Alger" and the "Congr&#232;sde Paris", Lavigerie, broken in health, retired to Algiers. His last two years were saddened by the often <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> criticism of his cherished project &#151; the "fr&#232;res pionniers du Sahara" &#151; the death of many of his missionaries, and, above all, the passing of Uganda under the control of the sectarian Imperial East-African Company. He died at <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a> as preparations were being made for the twenty-fifth anniversary of his African episcopate. The daily press throughout the world eulogized him, who had forbidden all eulogies at his funeral, and the "Moniteur de Rome" rightly summarized his life by saying that, in a few years of incredible activity, he had laid out work for generations. An able scholar and an orator of the first order, Lavigerie was also a writer. Besides some scholastic productions destined for his pupils at the Ecole des Carmes (1848), we have from his pen a doctorate thesis: "Essai sur l'&eacute;cole chr&eacute;tienne d'Edesse" (Paris, 1850); several contributions to the "Biblioth&#232;que pieuse et instructive &#224; l'usage de la jeunesse chr&eacute;tienne" (Paris, 1853); "Expos&eacute; des erreurs doctrinales du Jans&eacute;nisme" (Paris, 1858), an abridgment of his lessons at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>; "Decreta concilii provincialis Algeriensis in Africa" (1873); a large number of discourses, pamphlets, or reports, some of which were embodied in the two volumes of his "&OElig;uvres choises" (Paris, 1884); "Documents pour la fondation de l'&aelig;uvre antiesclavagiste" (St. Cloud, 1889), etc.
