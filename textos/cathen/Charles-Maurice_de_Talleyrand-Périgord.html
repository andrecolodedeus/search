<h1>Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P&eacute;rigord</h1>  

<p>Prince of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, French minister and ambassador, born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 13 February, 1754, died there, May, 1838. The eldest of an ancient <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he was destined for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, owing to an accident which had made him lame. After having completed his studies at the Coll&egrave;ge d'Harcourt, he went to St-Sulpice and, against his inclination, became an abb&eacute;. He then read the "most revolutionary books", and at length, giving up his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> life, plunged into the licentiousness of the period. Having, nevertheless, been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (1779) and appointed general agent of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (1780) he rapidly acquired a reputation as a man of ability. The <a href="../cathen/01795a.htm">Assembly of the Clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> of 1782 appointed him their promoter, and in 1785 he became secretary. Owing to his <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> immorality he obtained an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> only through a promise wrung from the dying king by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Comte Daniel de Talleyrand. Consecrated on 16 January, 1789, and promoted to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, he appeared in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> only to be elected a member of the "Etats G&eacute;n&eacute;raux". He soon became one of the most important personages in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and utilized every opportunity to advance his private interests.

<p>Opposed in his heart to a <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolution</a> which he accused of having "dismembered France", he first advised Louis XVI to dissolve the Assembly, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> the democratic movement irresistible he joined it. As a member of' the Constitutional Committee, he took part in the "Declaration of the Rights of Man". He extolled the spoliation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to the Civil Constitution. His chapter, however, having described him as deserving "infamy in this world and damnation in the next", he resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. But he had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> several constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, given Gobel the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 13 April, 1791. In 1792 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> on an unofficial diplomatic mission and endeavoured to organize a Franco-English alliance. He did not, however, obtain more than a promise of neutrality. Finally banished by the Convention, he escaped to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. He returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in March, 1796, and, owing to the influence of Barras, was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. He immediately welcomed <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> as the great auxiliary "who would make everything smooth". With <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> and Siey&egrave;s he prepared the coup d'&eacute;tat of

<p>Brumaire, after which he assisted the First Consul in the drafting of the Concordat. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> meanwhile had released him from the ban of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and restored him to secular life and the lay communion. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> then compelled him (1803) to marry by <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> his mistress, Madame Grand, an English divorc&eacute;e, who had not lived with her former husband. As the principal agent in the treaties concluded by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, he obtained for his services a fortune of some sixty million francs. He was made grand chamberlain, vice-elector of the Empire, and Sovereign Prince of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. However, he advised against the Franco-Russian Alliance and resigned the ministry in August, 1807. His opposition to the Spanish War in 1809 was the cause of his complete disgrace, and he awaited at Valen&ccedil;ay at his hotel in the Rue St. Florentin the fall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>.

<p>In 1814 the Emperor of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, his guest, "committed himself entirely into his hands". Once more leader of the provisional Government, he made the Senate establish a constitution to give power to Louis XVIII. On his appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs he preserved to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> its frontiers of 1792, and at the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> he broke the union of the great powers by secretly concluding a treaty with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Again appointed minister of Louis XVIII (1815) he preserved his country from dismemberment, but left the presidency of the Council after the election of 22 August, 1815. As grand chamberlain and peer of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he henceforward contented himself with watching and sententiously criticizing events. In 1830 Louis Philippe, whose accession he had favoured, appointed him to the embassy of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, where the representatives of all the countries "bent before him". After having established the entente cordiale with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he resigned office in November, 1834. In his magnificent "solitude" of Valen&ccedil;ay he wrote his "M&eacute;moires", in which he asserts he "never had betrayed a government which had not betrayed itself first", nor ever put his "own interests in the balance with those of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>". Four hours before his death he signed, in the presence of <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Abb&eacute; Dupanloup</a>, a solemn declaration in which he openly disavowed "the great <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which . . . had troubled and afflicted the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Apostolic and <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and in which he himself had had the misfortune to fall".
