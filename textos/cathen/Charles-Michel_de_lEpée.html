<h1>Charles-Michel de l'Ep&eacute;e</h1>  

<p>A philanthropic <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and inventor of the sign alphabet for the instruction of the deaf and dumb; was b. at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, 25 November, 1712; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 23 December, 1789. He studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, but, having refused to sign a condemnation of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, was denied <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> by Christophe de Beaumont, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He then studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but no sooner had he been admitted to the Bar than the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> consented to ordain him. This <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> died shortly afterwards, whereupon the Abb&eacute; de l'Ep&eacute;e returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and began to occupy himself with the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of two deaf and dumb sisters who had been recommended to him by Father Vanin, of the Congregation of the Christian Doctrine. He endeavoured to develop the minds of his pupils by means of certain conventional signs constituting a complete alphabet. Succeeding in this attempt, he resolved to devote himself to the <a href="../cathen/05315a.htm">education of the deaf and dumb</a>, and founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for their instruction at his own expense. His method is based on the principle that "the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of deaf mutes must teach them through the eye what other people acquire through the ear". Several other methods had been tried, previous to this time, to enable the deaf and dumb to communicate with one another and with the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, but there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he attained far greater success than Pereira, Bulwer, Dalgano, Dr. John Wallis, or any of his predecessors, and that the whole system now followed in the instruction of deaf mutes virtually owes its origin to his ingenuity and devotion. His own system has, in its turn, been replaced by a newer method, which teaches the pupils to recognize words and, in time, to utter them, by closely watching, and afterwards imitating, the motions of the lips and tongue in speech, the different portions of the vocal organs being shown by means of diagrams. Excellent results have thus been attained, deaf and dumb <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> acquiring the ability to converse fluently. This method has of late increased in favour. But it remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the Abb&eacute; de l'Ep&eacute;e by his sign system laid the foundations of all systematic instruction of the deaf and dumb, a system which was further developed by his pupil and successor, the Abb&eacute; Sicard.

<p>The Abb&eacute; de l'Ep&eacute;e became known all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> himself visited his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The Duke of Penthi&egrave;vre, as well as Louis XVI, helped him with large contributions. In 1791, two years after his death, the National Assembly decreed that his name should be enrolled among the benefactors of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and undertook the support of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> he had founded. In 1838 a bronze monument was erected over his grave in the church of Saint-Roch in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He published in 1776 "Institution des sourds-muets par la voie des signes m&eacute;thodiques"; in 1794, "La v&eacute;ritable mani&egrave;re d'instruire les sourds et muets, confirm&eacute;e par une longue exp&eacute;rience". He also began a "Dictionnaire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des signes", which was completed by the Abb&eacute; Sicard. (See <a href="../cathen/05315a.htm">EDUCATION OF THE DEAF AND DUMB</a>.)
