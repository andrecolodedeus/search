<h1>Charles Calvert</h1>  

<p>Third Baron of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and second Proprietary Governor of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. Born in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 1629; died at Epsom, Surrey, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 20 February, 1715. He was the son of <a href="../cathen/03193a.htm">Cecilius Calvert</a>, second Lord Baltimore, and Anne Arundel (Calvert). He was Proprietary Governor of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> from 1661 to 1684, and Lord Proprietor from 1675 to 1691. He married Jane, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Henry Sewell of Matapaney on the Patuxent, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. During his administration, boundary disputes with Virginia, the Swedes of Delaware, and William Penn came up and were settled. He became proprietor upon the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, 1675. At this time an effort was made by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to make the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> the established Church of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, but he succeeded in maintaining religious freedom. In 1676 the assembly was called together and important changes were made in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. At this time the colony was growing rapidly, the population having increased from 1200 to 2000 between the years 1660 and 1675. He went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1676 and returned in 1680. In 1682 he, with his uncle <a href="../cathen/03194c.htm">Philip Calvert</a>, met William Penn to settle the boundary dispute between <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. At this time dissensions were frequent in the colony and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> bigotry was rising in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Calvert left for the mother country in 1684 to look after the interests of the colony. After the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant revolution</a> in 1688, which placed William and Mary on the throne of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Baltimore was deprived of his proprietary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in 1691. In 1711 he petitioned the crown to have the government of the province restored to him, but this was refused on account of his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Although he never visited <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he was outlawed there for high treason on account of his religion but this outlawry was reversed by the king in 1691.
