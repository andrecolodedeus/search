<h1>Charles Dolman</h1>  

<p>Publisher and bookseller, b. at Monmouth, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 20 Sept., 1807; d. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 31 December, 1863. He was the only son of Charles Dolman, a surgeon of Monmouth, and Mary Frances his wife, daughter of Thomas Booker, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publisher in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at St. Gregory's, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> college at <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside</a>, near Bath, he later, while residing at Preston, Lancashire, studied architecture under Joseph A. Hansom, intending to follow that profession, but abandoned the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> on being invited by the Bookers, publishers and booksellers, into which <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> had married, to go to London. When Joseph Booker died in 1837, he was induced to carry on the business with his aunt, Mary Booker, and his cousin, Thomas Booker. In 1840 the name of the firm was changed to Booker &amp; Dolman and finally the business was continued in his name only. His career as a publisher of periodical literature began when in 1838 he brought out a new series of "The Catholic Magazine", which up to that time had been known as "The Edinburgh Catholic Magazine", in contradistinction to "The Catholic Magazine", a much older publication which had gone out of existence in 1835. Dolman's publication was discontinued in June, 1844, but his name had become so widely known that in March, 1845, he brought out a new periodical called "Dolman's Magazine and Monthly Miscellany of Criticism". This was at first under the sole management of its publisher, but later the Rev. Edward Price succeeded him. Like the others it was short-lived and in 1849 it was merged with "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Weekly and Monthly Orthodox" under the title "The Weekly Register". It first appeared under the new name, 4 August, 1849, published by Thomas Booker. From this time on Dolman abandoned the publication of periodicals and devoted himself solely to works that had never before been brought out by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press. His many efforts to raise the standard of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press ended in failure. Disheartened by his ill-success and broken down in health, he retired to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he died. He was survived by his wife and an only son, the Very Rev. Charles Vincent Dolman, of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, canon of Newport.
