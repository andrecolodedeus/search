<h1>Charles Erskine</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 13 Feb., 1739; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 20 March, 1811. He was the son of Colin Erskine of the Erskine <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, who were Earls of Kellie and Mar; his mother was Agatha Gigli of the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Gigli of <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by Cardinal Henry, Duke of York, at the <a href="../cathen/13632a.htm">Scots College</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was afterwards a successful advocate, becoming Doctor of Laws in 1770. <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pope Pius VI</a> made him pro-auditor and <a href="../cathen/12454a.htm">Promoter of the Faith</a> in 1782, also a <a href="../cathen/10510a.htm">domestic prelate</a>, canon of St. Peter's, and <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">dean</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of consistorial advocates. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, 28 August, 1783. In October, 1793, he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal envoy</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. By his tack and ability Mgr. Erskine established excellent relations with the Court and the ministry, diminished the dissensions among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and avoided stirring up any anti-Catholic demonstration against himself. During his stay in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> named him <a href="../cathen/02070c.htm">auditor</a>, and in 1795 gave him additional powers as envoy extraordinary. He left <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1801 and returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where in January, 1803, he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. As a member of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> he was still useful to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and was made protector of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. On the French invasion of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1808 he was made pro-secretary of Briefs, and was shut up in the Quirinal with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. When <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> Erskine was allowed to go free, but his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was now lost and he would have been reduced to <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">beggary</a> if his <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> relations had not made him an allowance. In 1809 <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> ordered him to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and though ill he was forced from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in January, 1810. Shortly after his arrival in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he fell into a gradual decline and soon died. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the church of Saint-Genevieve, now the Pantheon.
