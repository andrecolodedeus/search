<h1>Charles Garnier</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Missionary, born at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1606, of Jean G. and Anne de Garault; died 7 December, 1649. He studied classics, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, joining the order in 1624. He begged to be sent to the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> mission, and sailed in 1636 on the same fleet as <a href="../cathen/10543a.htm">Governor Montmagny</a>. He was sent forthwith to the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> country, where he was to spend the fourteen years of his heroic apostolate without once returning to Quebec. In six months he mastered the difficult language, and began a career of unceasing charity which was to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion of infidels brooked no hindrance nor delay. Neither distance nor weather, nor danger of death could prevent him from hastening to the stake to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and exhort captives of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Filth, vermin, fetid and loathsome disease could not deter him from tending and redeeming dying sinners. His frail frame <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> resisted the intense strain. His angelic patience amidst endless trials won him the title of "lamb" of the mission, whereof Br&eacute;beuf was styled the "lion". Several times &#151; first in 1637, then in 1639 with Jogues, and later with Pijart &#151; he strove to convert the Tobacco nation. His constancy finally overcame their obstinacy. They asked for the black robes (1646), and Garnier went to dwell with them until death. After the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Fathers Daniel (1648), Br&eacute;beuf, and Lalemant (March 1649), he calmly awaited his turn. After decimating the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> attacked the Tobacco nation. During the massacre of St. John's village, Garnier went about exhorting his <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> to be faithful. Mortally wounded he dragged himself towards a dying Indian to absolve him, and received the final blow in the very act of charity (1649) on the eve of the Immaculate Conception, a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> he had vowed to defend. His letters to his brother, a carmelite, reveal his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. <a href="../cathen/12633b.htm">Ragueneau</a> testifies to his heroic spirit of sacrifice. Parkman compares his life to that of <a href="../cathen/11763a.htm">St. Peter Claver</a> among the blacks and styles it a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.
