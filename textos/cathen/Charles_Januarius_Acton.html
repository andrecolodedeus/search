<h1>Charles Januarius Acton</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 6 March, 1803; died at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 23 June, 1847. He was the second son of Sir John Francis Acton, Bart. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, a cadet branch of the Actons of Aldenham Hall, near Bridgnorth, in Shropshire, had settled in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> some time before his birth. His father was engaged in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> trade when he succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> estate and title through the death of his cousin, Sir Richard Acton, Bart. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal's</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was English, as he and his elder brother were sent to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on their father's death in 1811, to a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> near <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> kept by the Abb&eacute; Au&eacute;qu&eacute;. They were then sent to Westminster School, with the understanding that their religion was not to be interfered with. Yet, they not only were sent to this <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, but they had a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> as tutor. In 1819 they went to Magdalen College, Cambridge, where they finished their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. After this strange schooling for a future <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, Charles went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when he was twenty and entered the Academia Ecclesiastica, where <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> intending to be candidates for public offices receive a special training. An essay of his attracted the attention of the Secretary of State, della Somaglia, and <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> made him a chamberlain and attach&eacute; to the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Nunciature, where he had the best opportunity to become acquainted with diplomacy. <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> recalled him and named him vice-legate, granting him choice of any of the four legations over which <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> presided. He chose Bologna, as affording most opportunity for improvement. He left there at the close of <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII's</a> brief pontificate, and went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in 1829, to marry his sister to Sir Richard Throckmorton. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> made him assistant judge in the Civil Court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1837 he was made Auditor to the <a href="../cathen/01633b.htm">Apostolic Chamber</a>, the highest Roman dignity after the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. Probably this was the first time it was even offered to a foreigner. Acton declined it, but was commanded to retain it. He was proclaimed <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a>, with the title of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> della Pace, in 1842; having been created nearly three years previously. His strength, never very great, began to decline, and a severe attack of ague made him seek rest and recuperation, first at Palermo and then at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. But without avail, for he died in the latter city. His sterling worth was little known through his modesty and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. In his youth his musical talent and genial wit supplied much innocent gaiety, but the pressure of serious responsibilities and the adoption of a spiritual life somewhat subdued its exercise.

<p>His judgment and legal ability were such that advocates of the first rank said that could they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his view of a case they could tell how it would be decided. When he communicated anything in writing, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory</a> used to say he never had occasion to read it more than once. He was selected as interpreter in the interview which the Pope had with the Czar of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> never said anything about this except that when he had interpreted the Pope's first sentence the Czar said: "It will be agreeable to me, if your Eminence will act as my interpreter, also." After the conference Cardinal Acton, by request of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, wrote out a minute account of it; but he never permitted it to be seen. The King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> urged him earnestly to become <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, but he inexorably refused. His charities were unbounded. He once wrote from <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> that he actually tasted the distress which he sought to solace. He may be said to have departed this life in all the wealth of a willing poverty.
