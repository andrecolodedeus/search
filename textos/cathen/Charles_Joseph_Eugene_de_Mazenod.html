<h1>Charles Joseph Eugene de Mazenod</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, and founder of the Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, in Provence, 1 August, 1782; d. at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> 21 May, 1861. De Mazenod was the offspring of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and even in his tender years he showed unmistakable evidence of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> disposition and a high and independent spirit. Sharing the fate of most French noblemen at the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, he passed some years as an exile in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, after which he studied for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, though he was the last representative of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. On 21 December, 1811, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, whither he had gone to escape receiving orders at the hands of Cardinal Maury, who was then governing the archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> against the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. After some years of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> labours at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, the young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, bewailing the sad fate of religion resulting among the masses from the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, gathered together a little band of missionaries to preach in the vernacular and to instruct the rural populations of Provence. He commenced, 25 January, 1816, his Institute which was immediately prolific of much good among the people, and on 17 February, 1826, was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> approved by <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> under the name of Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>.

<p>After having aided for some time his uncle, the aged <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, in the administration of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Father De Mazenod was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and, on 14 October, 1832, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Icosium, which title he had, in the beginning of 1837, to exchange for that of Bioshop of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. His episcopate was marked by measures tending to the restoration in all its integrity of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. De Mazenod unceasingly strove to uphold the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, somewhat obscured in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by the pretensions of the Gallican Church. He favoured the moral teachings of Blessed (now Saint) Alphonsus Liguori, whose <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> system he was the first to introduce in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and whose first life in French he caused to be written by one of his disciples among the Oblates. At the same time he watched with a jealous eye over the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth, and, in spite of the susceptibilities of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, he never swerved from what he considered the path of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. In fact, by the apostolic freedom of his public utterances he deserved to be compared to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>. He was ever a strong supporter of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> and a devout advocate of Mary's immaculate conception, in the solemn definition of which (1854) he took an active part. In spite of his well-known outspokenness, he was made a Peer of the French Empire, and in 1851 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> gave him the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>.

<p>Meanwhile he continued as Superior General of the religious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> he had founded and whose fortunes will be found described in the article on the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>. Such was the esteem in which he was held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had marked him out as one of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> he was to create when death claimed him at the ripe age of almost seventy-nine.
