<h1>Charles Lalemant</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 17 November, 1587; died there, 18 November, 1674. He was the first superior of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and his letter to his brother <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1 August, 1626, inaugurated the series of "Relations" about the missionary work in that country. Thwarted by the Trading Company at Quebec in his efforts to evangelize the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to protest. Attempting to return to America his vessel was captured by Kirke who was then blockading the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> and he was sent as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. A second attempt resulted in shipwreck off Cape Canso, and on his way back to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in a fishing smack which picked him up he was wrecked a second time on the coast of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He finally reached America in 1632 after Quebec was restored to the French. He was the friend and confessor of <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a>, who died in his arms. He returned again to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1638, where he became <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> missions, vice provincial and superior of the "Professed house" in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It was he who obtained the concession of the Island of Montreal for the colony of Dauversi&egrave;re, and he also got <a href="../cathen/16059b.htm">Maisonneuve</a> and <a href="../cathen/09584a.htm">Jeanne Mance</a> to engage in the undertaking. When there was question of appointing the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, his candidacy was urged. He is the author of a spiritual work, not generally known, entitled "La vie cach&eacute;e de Notre Seigneur J&eacute;sus-Christ", and is not to be confounded with Louis Lallement who is the author of "Les conferences spirituelles".
