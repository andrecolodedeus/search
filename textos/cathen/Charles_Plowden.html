<h1>Charles Plowden</h1>  

<p>Born at Plowden Hall, Shropshire, 1743; died at Jougne, Doubs, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 13 June, 1821. He was lineally descended from <a href="../cathen/12167b.htm">Edmund Plowden</a>, the celebrated lawyer. The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> adhered steadily to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, contributed ten members to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and numerous subjects to various <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders (see <a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley</a>, "Records of the English Province". Plowden Pedigree, IV, 537). <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">St. Omer's</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1759, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1770. At the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a>, in 1773, he was minister of the English College at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>: the Austro-Belgic government, in its execution of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of suppression, kept him <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for some months after the closing of the college. He wrote an account of its destruction. After his release from confinement, he was for a time at the Academy of Li&egrave;ge, which the prince-bishop had offered to the English ex-Jesuits. Returning to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he became a tutor in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Mr. Weld, and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at Lulworth Castle, where he assisted at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Bishop Carroll, in 1790. He preached the sermon on the occasion, and published an account of the establishment of the new See of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Father Plowden had a large share in the direction of Stonyhurst College, founded in 1794, and by his ability and virtue, "he promoted the credit and welfare of that institution" (Oliver). Richard Lalor Shiel, who had been his pupil, speaks of him as "a perfect <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> of the old <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>". After the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he was the first master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, at Hodder. In 1817, he was declared Provincial, and at the same time, Rector of Stonyhurst, holding the later office till 1819. Summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the election of the general of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, he died suddenly on his journey homeward, and, through mistaken information to his mission and identity, he was buried with full military honours. His attendant had gathered the information that he had been at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in connection with business concerning a "general", and the town authorities, mixing things, concluded that he was a general of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> army &#151; hence the military funeral.

<p>In addition to his many administrative activities and occupations, Father Plowden was a profile writer. Sommervogel gives a list of twenty-two publications of which he was the author, besides several works in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> which have been preserved. He was a lifelong correspondent of Bishop Carroll and wrote a beautiful eulogy on the death of his friend in 1815. A large collection of the letters which the interchanged, originals or copies, exists at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a> and Georgetown Colleges, as also in the Baltimore <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> archives. He was protagonist in the polemics that distracted the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in relation to the Oath proposed as a preliminary to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Bill. It was "a desperate life and death struggle of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, during one of the most insidious and dangerous assaults upon its liberties to which it had ever been exposed". Writers on both sides, in the heat of controversy, employed language which subsequently necessitated explanation, apologies, and retractions. Plowden was too outspoken and perfervid in some of his utterances, but his spirit was that of loyalty to the vicars-Apostolic and to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> traditions.
