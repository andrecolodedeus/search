<h1>Charles Rollin</h1>  

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1661; died there, 1741. The son of a cutler, intended to follow his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> trade, he was remarkable for the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> with which he served Mass and which secured for him a collegiate scholarship. He studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and received the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, but not <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>. He was assistant professor, and then professor of rhetoric at the Coll&egrave;ge de Plessis; of Latin eloquence at the Coll&egrave;ge Royal (1688), and at the age of thirty-three was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1696 he became principal of the Coll&egrave;ge de Beauvais, from which post he was dismissed in 1722 because of his opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>. He was a member of the Academy of Inscriptions from 1701. His works were written during his retirement. He was nearly sixty when he began the "Trait&eacute; des Etudes", sixty-seven when he undertook his "Histoire Ancienne", seventy-seven when he became engaged on his "Histoire Romaine", which death prevented him from finishing. The "Trait&eacute; des Etudes" (in 12&#176;, 1726-31) explains the method of teaching and studying belles-lettres; it contains <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which seem hackneyed, but which then were fairly new, e.g. the necessity of studying national history and of making use of school-books written in the vernacular. The "Histoire Ancienne" (1730-38) consists of twelve volumes in 12&#176;. The "Histoire Romaine", of which he was able to finish only five volumes out of the nine composing the work, displays facility, interest, enthusiasm, but lack of a critical spirit. Rollin was a talented writer, though according to his own statement he was sixty years old when he decided to write in French. He was upright and serene, a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and sincere <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, whom it is deplorable to find concerned in the ridiculous scenes at the cemetery of St. M&eacute;dard near the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Without the annoyances due to his <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, his pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, sweet gaiety, vigorous health, and the esteem he enjoyed should have made him one of the most fortunate men of his times.
