<h1>Charles Walmesley</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rama, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Western District, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, b. 13 Jan., 1722; d. at <a href="../cathen/02347a.htm">Bath</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 25 Nov., 1797. He was the fifth son of John Walmesley of Westwood House, Wigan, Lancashire; was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> College of St. Gregory at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> (now Downside Abbey, Bath); and made his profession as a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at the English Monastery of St. Edmund, Paris, in 1739. Later he took the degree of D.D. at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. His scientific attainments soon brought him into notice as an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> and mathematician. He was consulted by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government on the reform of the calendar and introduction of the "New Style", and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and the kindred <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, and Bologna. From 1749 to 1753 he was Prior of St. Edmund's, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and in 1754 was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> general of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation. Two years later he was selected by <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> as coadjutor, with right of succession, to Bishop York, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Western District; and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rama on 21 Dec., 1756. He administered the vicariate after the retirement of Bishop York in 1763, and succeeded that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> on his death in 1770. His energy and ability attracted to him an amount of attention seldom given to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the eighteenth century. So much was this the case that during the "No Popery" riots of June, 1780, a post-chaise conveying four of the rioters, and bearing the insignia of the mob, drove the whole way from <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to Bath, where Walmesley then resided. These men worked upon the people of Bath so much that the newly built <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in St. James's Parade was burned to the ground, as well as the presbytery in Bell-Tree Lane; all the registers and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> archives, with Walmesley's private <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, being destroyed.

<p>In 1789 when the action of the "Catholic Committee" threatened seriously to compromise the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Walmesley called a synod of his colleagues, and a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was issued that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> "unanimously condemned the new form of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> intended for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and declared it unlawful to be taken". On 15 August, 1790, Walmesley <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Dr. John Carroll, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the United States of America, at Lulworth Castle, Dorsetshire. Walmesley was buried at St. Joseph's Chapel, Trenchard Street, Bristol. In 1906 the bodies there <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> were removed, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> remains were translated to Downside Abbey and placed in a vault beneath the choir of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, so that, more than a century after his death, his body came into the charge of that community by whom he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> nearly two hundred years ago. The suggestion was put forward that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the two hierarchies of America and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, of whom the large majority trace their spiritual descent to Bishop Walmesley, should erect a fitting monument over his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a>. The proposal met with generous support, and a beautiful <a href="../cathen/01357c.htm">altar tomb</a> with recumbent effigy in alabaster from the designs of F.A. Walters, F.S.A., has now been erected on the Gospel side of the sanctuary. Walmesley's published works consist chiefly of treatises on <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> and mathematics, but his "General History of the Christian Church . . . chiefly deduced from the Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle, by Signor Patorini" (a pseudonym), went through nine or ten editions in Great Britain and five more were produced in America. Translations of the work also appeared in Latin, French, German, and Italian, and were several times reprinted. A number of his letters are in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/04058c.htm">Diocese of Clifton</a>. Portraits exist at <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside</a>, <a href="../cathen/04058c.htm">Clifton</a>, and Lulworth.
