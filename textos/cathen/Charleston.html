<h1>Charleston</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of Charleston (Carolopolitana) now comprises the entire <a href="../cathen/14157a.htm">State of South Carolina</a>, U.S.A. (area 30,170 sq. miles). It was established 12 July, 1820, and then included both Georgia and North Carolina. The former state became the territory of the new <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Diocese of Savannah</a> in 1850, and in 1868 North Carolina became a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>. Mass was first said in Charleston in 1786, by an Italian [illustration of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. John the Baptist] <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on his way to South America, for a congregation of twelve <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. A year or two later the congregation numbered about 200, at which time an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named O'Reilly (according to Ramsay) or Ryan (according to Shea) celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> for 200 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in an abandoned <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodist</a> meeting-house. In 1789 this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was purchased by the Rev. Thomas Keating and the building renovated as St. Mary's Church. Religious disabilities were still on the law-books, but in 1791 an Act of the Legislature incorporated the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> Church of Charleston. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Charleston, the <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Rt. Rev. John England</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 21 Sept., 1820, and reached Charleston in December of that year. Because of dissentions in St. Mary's congregation he erected a plain wooden structure in 1821, and made it his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> under the title of St. John and St. Finbar. His admirable administration marks an epoch not only in the history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but also in that of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and is more fully treated in the article <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">JOHN ENGLAND</a>. He died 11 April, 1842, lamented by all. His former coadjutor, the Rt. Rev. William Clancy was transferred in 1843 to the Vicariate Apostolic of Guinea. The second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Charleston, the Rt. Rev. Ignatius A. Reynolds, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, 10 March, 1844, and signalized his episcopate by the publication of an edition (in five volumes) of the works of his predecessor and the erection of a new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He was a very ascetic man and tireless worker, and died 9 March, 1855. The third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was the Rt. Rev. Neisen Lynch, a brilliant graduate of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> Col-[pg. 631] lege at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and one of the most learned members of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; his numerous lectures, essays and treatises exhibit the versatility and accuracy of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. His episcopate was marked by grievous afflictions. The disastrous fire of 1861, closely following the opening of hostilities in Charleston harbour during the Civil War, destroyed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> residence, and other valuable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. The subsequent bombardment of the city for nearly two years wrought further damage, closed most of the churches, and depleted and impoverished the congregations. General Sherman's occupation of Columbia was marked by the burning of St. Mary's College, the Sisters' Home, and the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Convent.

<p>Towards the end of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> Bishop Lynch went to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> as the accredited representative of the Confederacy on a confidential mission. On his return immediately after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, he stood in the midst of ruins, among a destitute and dejected people, with a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of over $200,000 pressing upon him. He at once began to collect funds throughout the country for the immediate needs of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and to liquidate its <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">indebtedness</a>. Most of the succeeding seventeen years were devoted to this work; he left but a small balance of the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> unpaid at his death, 22 February, 1882, having in the meantime built a pro-cathedral, purchased an episcopal residence and restored much <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. He was a member of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (1869-1870) to which he was accompanied by the <a href="../cathen/04356b.htm">Rev. Dr. James A. Corcoran</a> one of the most erudite of the American <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> then working in the Charleston Diocese. During the frequent absence of Bishop Lynch the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was ably governed by his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Dr. Quigley, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Patrick's Church, under whom was opened <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> Infirmary, built with the bequest of a devout lady, and conducted by the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>.

<p>The fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Rt. Rev. Henry Pinckney Northrop (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 8 January, 1882), was transferred (27 January, 1883) from the Vicariate Apostolic of North Carolina to Charleston. On the night of 31 August, 1886, Charleston was visited by an earthquake which wrecked the pro-cathedral and episcopal residence, and wrought great damage to <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> in the city. Through the generous contributions of benefactors in the North, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, rectories and institutions were completely restored. Under previous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> churches were erected in the principal cities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Bishop Northrop kept pace with the material progress of the State, and dedicated twelve churches, besides the new Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, one of the most beautiful in the South, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 14 April, 1907. The solicitude of Bishop Lynch for the spiritual welfare of the coloured people was emulated by his successors. In 1867 Bishop Lynch purchased and dedicated a church for them exclusively. Its flourishing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is in charge of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> residing at St. Catherine's Convent attached to the church, established under Bishop Northrop, and named for Mother Catherine Drexel, the generous benefactress of this church and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and of the coloured congregation at <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Cross Roads. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, who were introduced in 1829, care for the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and devote their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> labours to academies and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> began their foundation in 1834, and have had as pupils daughters of the leading citizens of the State. In 1907 Bishop Northrop introduced the Ladies of the Cenacle. The <a href="../cathen/14275a.htm">religious statistics</a> (1908) are as follows: Priests, 19; churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 12; missions with churches, 17; stations, 75; religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, 98; students in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, 4; academies for young ladies, 5; pupils, 337; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 8; pupils, 590; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and cared for, 72; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, 1; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, 9,650.
