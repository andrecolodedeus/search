<h1>Charlottetown</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF CHARLOTTETOWN (CAROLINAPOLITANA)

<p>Includes all Prince Edward Island (formerly called St. John's Island), the smallest province of the dominion of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. It is situated in the southern waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and, together with the Magdalen Islands lying about sixty miles to the north-east of it, constitutes a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which takes its name from Charlottetown, the chief town of Prince Edward Island. The history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in the territory now comprised in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Charlottetown goes back to the year 1719, when all the islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence were granted by the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to count Saint-Pierre, a nobleman of his court. Up to that time the population of Prince Edward Island consisted of a few Indians, but on its concession to Count Saint-Pierre immigration set in, and soon a number of settlements were formed, the chief one being at Port La Joie, where the count established his head-quarters. The first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to labour in the new colony was Ren&eacute;-Charles De Breslay, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician who came from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in April 1721, and who was joined a few months later by Marie-Anselme de Metivier, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the same community. These two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> remained only about two years, and on their return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> their place was taken by <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who for thirty years ministered to the spiritual wants of the colony. Meanwhile, by the influx of settlers from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Acadia, the population had so increased that a system of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> organization became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were gradually formed, to preside over which four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> came from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, whose diocese then comprised the whole of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Thus, in 1753, five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> laboured in Prince Edward Island, viz., Father Girard at Point Prim, Father Cassiet at Scotchfort, Father Biscaret at St. Peter's, <a href="../cathen/05137a.htm">Father Dosquet</a> at Malpeque, and Father Aubr&eacute;. A <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, at Port La Joie. Unfortunately, these prosperous conditions did not long endure. They gave way before the English invasion of 1758, when most of the people were driven out, the churches razed to the ground, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> forced to leave the country. For these reasons Prince Edward Island was without a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, from 1758 to 1772, when there arrive an immigration of Scottish <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, accompanied by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the Rev. James Macdonald, who continued in charge of the whole colony till his death in 1785. Five years later a second band of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> came to swell the population, bringing with them the Rev. Angus Bernard MacEachern, the most striking figure in the early history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in the Diocese of Charlottetown.

<p>At this time Father Le Roux laboured in the Magdalen Islands, having been sent thither by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec to minister to the Acadians who had settled in that locality. He built a small church at the foot of Demoiselle Mountain on Amherst Island, where he remained till 1793, when he was succeeded by Father Alain. In 1798 two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Father De Calonne and Father Pichard, came to Prince Edward Island and took up their residence, the former in Charlottetown, the latter at Rustico. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to visit Prince Edward Island was the Rt. Rev. Pierre Denault, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, who went there in the summer of 1803. In 1812 his successor, the Rt. Rev. Joseph-Octave Plessis, visited the Maritime Provinces, bringing with him a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the Rev. Jean-Louis Beaubien, whom he stationed at Rustico, and to whom he entrusted the spiritual care of all the Acadian missions in Prince Edward Island and the Magdalen Islands. In the year 1819 Father MacEachern was named <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13191a.htm">Rosea</a>, and received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in Quebec 17 June, 1821. The following year witnessed the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> at Quebec of the first native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Father Bernard Donald Macdonald, who returned home in the early autumn to take charge of the Acadian missions. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13191a.htm">Rosea</a> at first was merely <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, and, though performing episcopal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> throughout the greater part of the Maritime Provinces, he did so without independent <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. But in August, 1829, Charlottetown was raised to the dignity of an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, and the Rt. Rev. Angus Bernard MacEachern became its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Besides Prince Edward Island and the Magdalen Islands, the new diocese comprised the whole of New Brunswick.

<p>On taking possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, one of the first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> to devolve on Bishop MacEachern was to establish an institution for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of students destined for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and accordingly St. Andrew's College was founded at St. Andrews, Prince Edward Island, in November, 1831. On 22 April, 1835, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Charlottetown died and was succeeded by the Rev. Bernard Donald Macdonald, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Quebec, 15 October, 1837. Five years later the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was dismembered, New Brunswick being made a separate diocese, with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at St. John. Bishop Macdonald closed the college at St. Andrews in 1844, and in the beginning of the year 1855 the present college of St. Dunstan opened its doors to its first student. On the 28th of September, 1857, four sisters of the Congregation of Notre-Dame opened a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in Charlottetown, where they began to give instruction to about sixteen pupils. Bishop Macdonald was called to his reward 30 December, 1859, and in the following year his successor, the Rt. Rev. Peter MacIntyre, received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Charlottetown, 15 August, 1860. The episcopate of Bishop MacIntyre covered a period of over thirty years, during which many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were erected throughout the diocese. He died 30 April, 1891, and was succeeded by the Rt. Rev. James Charles Macdonald, who had been named coadjutor with right of succession in the preceding year. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> is flourishing in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Charlottetown. A population of fifty thousand, under the guidance of forty-five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, worship in fifty-one churches, of which many are neat and elegant structures. Eight <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, wherein fifty <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the Congregation of Notre-Dame give instruction to over one thousand pupils, and St. Dunstan's College, with a roster of one hundred and thirty students, tell what is being done for catholic <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, whilst a fully-equipped <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, under the care of the Sisters of Charity of Quebec, furnishes relief to the sick and suffering.
