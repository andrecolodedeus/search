<h1>Chasuble</h1>  

<p><a href="../images/03639aax.jpg"><img alt="Image" align=right src="../images/03639aat.jpg"></a>

<p>Called in Latin <em>casula planeta</em> or <em>p&aelig;nula</em>, and in early Gallic sources <em>amphibalus</em>, the principal and most conspicuous Mass vestment, covering all the rest. Nearly all ecclesiologists are now agreed that <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> costume was simply an adaptation of the secular attire commonly worn throughout the Roman Empire in the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> centuries. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in discharging his sacred functions at the altar was dressed as in civil life, but the custom probably grew up of reserving for this purpose garments that were newer and cleaner than those used in his daily avocations, and out of this gradually developed the conception of a special <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> attire. In any case the chasuble in particular seems to have been identical with the ordinary outer garment of the lower orders. It consisted of a square or circular piece of cloth in the centre of which a hole was made; through this the head was passed. With the arms hanging down, this rude garment covered the whole figure. It was like a little house (<em>casula</em>). This derivation is curiously illustrated in the prophetic utterance of Druidical origin preserved in Muirchu's "Life of St. Patrick", almost the oldest allusion to the chasuble and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> which we possess. Before <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick's</a> coming to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the Druids were supposed to have circulated this <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a>: <blockquote> Adze-head [this is an allusion to the peculiar <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> form of <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>] will come with a crook-head staff; in his house head-holed [<em>in su&acirc; domu capiti perforat&acirc;</em>, i.e. chasuble] he will chant impiety from his table [i.e. the altar]; from the front [i.e. the eastern] part of his house all his household [attendant <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>] will respond, 'So be it! So be it!' </blockquote>

<p>The fact that at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the word <em>casal </em>established itself in the Celtic language, and that <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick's</a> <em>casal</em> in particular became famous, makes the allusion of the "house head-holed" almost certain. We can hardly help being reminded of <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore's</a> definition of <em>casula</em> as "a garment furnished with a hood, which is a diminutive of <em>casa</em>, a cottage, as, like a small cottage or hut, it covers the entire <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>". In the earliest chronicles some modification seems to have already taken place in the primitive conception of a hole cut in round piece of cloth. The early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> chasubles were made of a semicircular piece of stuff, the straight edge folded in the middle, and the two borders sewn together, leaving an aperture for the head. From this it will be seen that the chasuble is only a cope of which the front edges have been sewn together. The inconvenience of the primitive chasuble will be readily appreciated. It was impossible to use arms or hands without lifting the whole of the front part of the vestment. To remedy this, more than one expedient was resorted to. The sides were gradually cut away while the length before and behind remained unaltered. Thus, after being first curtailed at the sides until it reached but little below the elbows, it was eventually, in the sixteenth century, pared away still farther, until it now hardly extends below the shoulders and leaves the arms entirely free. While this shortening was still in progress, it became the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, assisting the celebrant, to roll back the chasuble and relieve as far as possible the weight on his arms. Directions to this effect are still given in the "C&aelig;remoniale Episcoporum", where it speaks of the vesting of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (C&aelig;remon. Episc., lib. II, cap. viii, n. 19). Another device adopted in some <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> chasubles, to remedy the inconvenience caused by the drag of the vestment upon the arms, was to insert a cord passing through rings by which the sides of the chasuble could be drawn up to the shoulders and secured in that position. This, however, was rare. The chasuble, though now regarded as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> vestment par excellence, was in the early centuries worn by all ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. "Folded chasubles" (<em>planet&aelig; plicat&aelig;</em>), instead of <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatics</a>, are still prescribed for the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at high Mass during penitential seasons. The precise origin of this pinning up of the chasuble is still obscure, but, like the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> wearing of the broad stole (<em>stolone</em>)--which represents the chasuble rolled up and hung over his shoulder like a soldier's great-coat--during the active part of his functions in the Mass, it probably had something to do with the inconvenience caused by the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> chasuble in impeding the free use of the arms.

<p>Of the chasuble as now in common usage in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> two principal types appear, which may for convenience be called the Roman and the French. The Roman is about 46 inches deep at the back and 30 inches wide. It is ornamented with orphreys forming a pillar behind and a tall cross in front, while the aperture for the neck is long and tapers downwards. The French type, also common in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and in a more debased form in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, is less ample and often artificially stiffened. It has a cross on the back and a pillar in front. In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> chasubles these orphrey crosses often assume a Y form, and the crosses themselves seem really to have originated less from any symbolical purpose than from sartorial reasons connected with the cut and adjustment.

<p>Like the other <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a> the chasuble, before use, requires to be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who has faculties for that purpose. When assumed in vesting for Mass, the act is accompanied with a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which speaks of the chasuble as the "yoke of Christ". But another symbolism is indicated by the form attached to the bestowal of the chasuble in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> services: "Receive", says the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> vestment, by which is signified charity."
