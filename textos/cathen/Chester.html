<h1>Chester</h1>  

<p>ANCIENT DIOCESE OF CHESTER (CESRENSIS).

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Though the See of Chester, schismatically created by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in 1541, was recognized by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> only for the short space of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary's</a> reign, the city had in earlier times possessed a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, though only intermittently. Even before the Norman conquest the title "Bishop of Chester" is found in documents applied to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who would be more correctly described as Bishops of Mercia or even of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>. After the Council of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1075 had decreed the transfer of all episcopal chairs to cities, Peter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, removed his seat from <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a> to Chester, and became known as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chester. There he chose the collegiate Church of St. John the Baptist as his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, however, transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Coventry on account of the rich <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> there, though he retained the episcopal palace at Chester. The Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield was of enormous extent, and it was probably found convenient to have something analogous to a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Chester, even though the <em>cathedra</em> itself were elsewhere; accordingly we find that the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John ranked as a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> for a considerable time, and had its own dean and chapter of secular canons down to the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. But the chief <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> foundation in Chester was the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15588b.htm">St. Werburgh</a>, the great church of which finally became the Cathedral <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Blessed Virgin Mary. The site had been occupied even during the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> period of the Roman occupation by a church dedicated to Sts. Peter and Paul, and rededicated to <a href="../cathen/15588b.htm">St. Werburgh</a> and St. Oswald during the Saxon period. The church was served by a small chapter of secular canons until 1093, when Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, converted it into a great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, in which foundation he had the co-operation of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, then Prior of Bec, who sent Richard, one of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, to be the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. A new Norman church was built by him and his successors. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, though suffering loss of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> both by the depredations of the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> and the inroads of the sea, prospered, and in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> transformed their Norman church into a gothic building which, though not be reckoned among the greatest <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, yet is not unworthy of its rank, and affords a valuable study in the evolution of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>. It has been said of it that "at every turn it is satisfying in small particulars and disappointing in great features". The last of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> was John, or Thomas, Clark, who resigned his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, valued at &#163;1,003 5s. 11d. per annum, to the king.

<p>In 1541 <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, having thrown off all obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, created six new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, one of which was Chester. The archdeaconry of Chester, from the Diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, and that of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, from York, were combined to form the new see, and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, now the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was to be served by a dean and six <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, the complaisant ex-abbot becoming the first dean. At first the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was annexed to the Province of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, but by another Act of Parliament it was soon transferred to that of York. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the Provincial of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, John Bird, a doctor of divinity who had attracted the king's attention by his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> preached against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> supremacy. Having already been reward by the Bishopric of Bangor, he was now translated to Chester. On the accession of Mary he was deprived as being a married man, and died Vicar of Dunmow in 1556. The diocese being now canonically recognized by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, George Cotys, Master of Balliol and Fellow of Magdalen College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> he had been a distinguished lecturer in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1556 he was succeeded by Cuthbert Scott, a very learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and Vice-Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge University</a>. On the accession of Elizabeth he was one of the four <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> chosen to defend <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> at the conference at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, and immediately after this he was sent to the Tower. Being released on bail, he contrived to escape to the Continent. He died at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, 9 Oct., 1564. The arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were: gules, three mitres and their labels, or.
