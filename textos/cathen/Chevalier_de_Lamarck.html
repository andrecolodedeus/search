<h1>Chevalier de Lamarck</h1>  

<p>(Jean-Baptiste-Pierre-Antoine de Monet; also spelled L<font size=-2>A</font> M<font size=-2>ARCK</font>; botanical abbreviation <em>Lam.</em>; zoological abbreviation <em>Lm.</em>)

<p>Distinguished botanist, zoologist, and natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, b. at Bazentin in Picardy (department of Somme), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1 August, 1744; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 18 December, 1829. His father, Pierre de Monet, intended him for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, so Lamarck first studied at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>. Upon the death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, however, he joined, in 1671 the French army in northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and on the day of his arrival, during the Seven Years' War, was made an officer on the field of battle for <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>. When twenty-four years old he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, on account of illness, to leave the army with a very small pension. While supporting himself by working as clerk in a bank at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he studied <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>, meteorology, and botany in his spare hours. He never practised <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>, and his numerous meteorological writings have no scientific value; the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of his physical and chemical works, in which he opposed <a href="../cathen/09052a.htm">Lavoisier</a>. They were all written to support himself and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. It was otherwise with the different branches of biology; from 1778 he was an able botanist, from 1794 a zoologist, about 1800 began his speculative labours upon the variation of species.

<p>In 1778 he wrote in six months the first complete account of the flora of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, "Flore fran&ccedil;aise" (3 vols., Paris, 1778; 3rd ed. edited by de Candolle, 6 vols., 1805-15). Both in the introduction to this work and in several treatises, Lamarck explained the analytical, dichotomous system of determining the species of plants, a system originated by him and now much used. In classification he maintained the principle, in opposition to <a href="../cathen/08569a.htm">Jussieu</a>, that a single part, no matter how essential, was not sufficient for the classification of the plant but that, in classification, all parts should be considered. This work led to his acquaintance with Buffon and in 1779 gained his election to the Academy of Sciences. With Buffon's son he then travelled through <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Once more in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he became a contributor to the "Encyclop&eacute;die m&eacute;thodique", for which he wrote the first four volumes of the "Dictionnaire de botanique" (Paris, 1783-96). In this work the genera of plants are skilfully treated in alphabetical order from A to P, the great collections of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> being exhaustively drawn upon. The large atlas "Illustration des Genres", which accompanied the work, contains 900 plates. Lamarck began a "Histoire naturelle des v&eacute;g&eacute;taux" (Paris, 1802), as part of the compilation "Suites de Buffon"; Mirbel continued the "Histoire naturelle" from volume III to XV. In the meantime Lamarck had received, in 1789, the position of keeper of the herbarium at the Jardin des Plantes as assistant to Daubenton, but he soon lost it. At no time in his life was he in very prosperous circumstances. When the Mus&eacute;um d'Histoire Naturelle was reorganized in 1793 there were no professors of zoology. The professorship for the lower animals was offered to the botanist Lamarck, and he had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> at the age of forty-nine to teach himself zoology. He commenced his zoological lectures in 1794 and carried them on until blindness forced him in 1818 to transfer them to the entomologist Latreille.

<p>Lamarck began by separating the animal kingdom into the two important divisions of vertebrates and invertebrates. He sought to develop the classification of invertebrates ("Syst&egrave;me des animaux sans vert&egrave;bres", Paris, 1801), and established numerous new genera and species for them. His most important zoological work is the "Histoire des animaux sans vertebras" (7 vols., Paris, 1815-22; 2nd ed., 11 vols., 1835-45). Particular mention should be made of Lamarck's investigations concerning molluses, especially his studies of the geologically important fossil molluses. For the last twenty years his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> has been far greater than in his lifetime in a.steadily increasing degree. His theoretical views concerning life-forms which were often regarded by his contemporaries, as by Cuvier, only as droll, fantastic crotchets, unworthy of notice or even of contradiction, are now considered by many <a href="../cathen/02572a.htm">biologists</a> as showing in the highest degree the originality of genius. These views are expressed in numerous treatises issued during the period 1802-20 but especially in his work "Philosophie zoologique" (2 vols., Paris, 1809, 1839, 1873, etc.; lately translated into other languages). They are the basis of that form of evolution which as Lamarckism, and of late in sharp opposition to Darwin as neo-Lamarckism, has distinguished adherents among botanists, zoologists, and pal&aelig;ontologists. These adherents, however, do not agree among themselves. Every year in increasing number appear popular and scientific works upon Lamarck and Lamarckism. His <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> were partly influenced by Maillet, Condillac, Rousseau, and especially by Buffon. Lamarck can with more right than Darwin be called the originator of the theory of evolution, just as he was also the first to choose the form of a genealogical tree to illustrate the genetic connection of organisms. According to him only a few species have died out; for the most part they have been modified. However, the word Lamarckism means above all the impelling forces, postulated by Lamarck, of phylogeny: the use or disuse of the organs, occasioned by need, consequently by a factor inherent in the life-form, is said to call forth adaptations which become permanent by heredity. Lamarck was, therefore, a vitalist, not a materialist; he was also neither an <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheist</a>, nor irreligious, nor an opponent of the Scriptures. On the contrary, in regard to the creation of man he frankly placed the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> higher than his own <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. At least there is no valid reason for regarding his words relative to this as <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocritical</a>, as many Lamarckians do. Lamarck's name is perpetuated in botany in the genera <em>Monetia, Markea, Lamarchea,</em> and <em>Lamarckia</em>. In 1909 a monument to him was unveiled in the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.
