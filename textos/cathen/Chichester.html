<h1>Chichester</h1>  

<p>Ancient <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Diocese of Chichester (Cicestrensis), in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> took its rise in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> passed at the Council of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1075, requiring all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> to be removed from villages to towns. The old see of the South Saxons, which had been founded towards the end of the seventh century by <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> of York, had been filled by a long line of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whose <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> was at Selsea. In consequence of the new <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, Stigand, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Selsea, transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Chichester in 1082. This town, called <em>Regnum</em> by the Romans, obtained its present name from Cissa, son of &#198;lle, the Saxon chieftain who landed in 477, the town becoming Cissa's <em>Ceaster,</em> or fort (<em>castrum</em>), and, in time, Chichester. The most notable of the early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was Ralph de Luffa (1091-1123), who built the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; much of the structure as it still exists was his work. In 1108 he was able to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> at least a part of it, but in 1114 the first fire occurred, and extensive rebuilding was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was completed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1184, but in 1186 it was again greatly damaged by fire. Bishop Seyffrid II (1180-1204), who had completed the building, now undertook its reconstruction, making considerable changes and introducing Early English work into the Norman building, which accounts for the composite character of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>. His successor, Simon Fitz Robert of Wells (1204-1207), being a favourite of King John, obtained many important privileges for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, but after his death, John kept it vacant for many years. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Richard Poore (1215-1217), known as the builder of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. After him came Ranulf of Warham (1217-1224) and Ralph Neville, the Chancellor (1224-1244), who was remarkable as a statesman. On his death there was a contest over the appointment to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> settled by naming and consecrating Richard of Wych (1245-1253), better known as St. Richard of Chichester, the friend and chancellor of St. Edmund. King Henry III, enraged at this, refused him the temporalities of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Having for a time been compelled to live on the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, St. Richard ultimately succeeded in overcoming the king's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and for eight years ruled the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> with wisdom and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, his last act being to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a church at Dover in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his friend and master, St. Edmund. In 1276, during the pontificate of Stephen of Berghsted (1262-1288), he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were enshrined above the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>.

<p>Chichester had another saintly <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> in Gilbert de S. Leophardo (1288-1305), who added to the Lady Chapel. William Rede (1369-1385) was a scholar-bishop who collected the early records of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and his namesake, Robert Rede (1397-1415) compiled the earliest register now existing. Bishops succeeded one another rapidly, many being transferred to other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Among them Reginald Pecock (1450-1459), famous for his learning, was accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. His successor, John Arundel, (1459-1478), built the rood screen in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. But the diocese fell into bad condition, as is shown by the register of the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Edward Storey (1478-1503), a wise administrator who founded the Chichester grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Robert Sherburne (1508-1536) made some protest against the encroachments of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, but being unable to withstand them officially, resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and was succeeded by the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> Richard Sampson (1536-1543), who in 1538 destroyed the shrine of St. Richard at the king's command. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, George Day (1543-1557), though he had accepted <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> institution from <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, on which account he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and replaced by John Scory. Bishop Day regained his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, however, in 1554. He was succeeded by John Christopherson (1557-1559), the last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chichester. After him the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> William Barlow inaugurated the line of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. There were in the diocese two archdeaconries, Chichester and Lewes, and, according to the valuation made in 1291, which remained the basis of valuations until the reign of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, there were nearly three hundred <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Battle Abbey and Lewes Priory were the chief <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and all the chief orders were well represented. One consequence of Sussex being originally so largely in the hands of Norman proprietors was the existence of an unusually large number of small <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> dependent on houses in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, such as the Abbey of F&eacute;camp. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had ten episcopal manors, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> held the collegiate church of South Malling and twenty-five <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were azure, a Presbyter John sitting on a tombstone, in his left hand a book open, his right hand extended, or, with a linen <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> on his head, and in his mouth a sword, all proper.
