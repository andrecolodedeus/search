<h1>China</h1>  

<p>The Chinese Empire, the largest political division of Eastern Asia, extends from 18&#176;10' to 53&#176;45' N. lat., and from 73&#176;47' to 134&#176;25' E. long. It includes China proper or the Eighteen Provinces (Shi-pa-sheng), theoretically a subject territory of <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a>, the cradle of the present dynasty, and the dependencies: Mongolia, Ili (or Sin-kiang), and Tibet. It boundaries are <ul> <li>on the north, Siberia; <li>west, Russian Turkistan; <li>south, British <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>; <li>southeast, <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a> and Tong-king; <li>east, the Pacific Ocean; <li>northeast, Korea. </ul> This article is concerned only with China proper.
<h2>Area and population</h2>

<p>Roughly speaking, the Eighteen Provinces occupy nearly one-third of the surface of the empire. The area of China proper is estimated in round numbers at 2,000,000 square miles; P&egrave;re Richard gives 1,532,800. The length is 1860, the breadth 1520, miles. According to the official trade returns for 1906, the estimated population of China was 438,214,000, which includes that of Feng-tien (Manchurian Province, 16,000,000). The "Almanachde Gotha" (1904) and the "Statesman's Yearbook" (1905) give for the Eighteen Provinces 319,510,000 and 407,335,305 respectively but Hon. W.W. Rockhill in a careful study (Smithson, Miscel. Col., quart. issue 27, part III) gives so low a figure as 270,000,000. The population at various epochs is as follows: <ul> <li>in 1390, 60,545,812; <li>in 1500, 53,281,153; <li>in 1619, 60,692,856; <li>time of Macartney, 333,000,000; <li>in 1842, 419,600,000; <li>in 1894, 412,800,000. </ul>
<h2>Names</h2>

<p>The Chinese call their empire <em>Chung kwo</em> (Middle Kingdom), a name first applied to Ho-nan, the country of the Chou dynasty; a Chinaman is designated <em>Chung-kwo-jen</em> or man of the Middle Kingdom; in diplomacy China is <em>Ta-ts'ing Kwo</em> (the great empire of Ts'ing, the present dynasty) as it was formerly <em>Ta Ming Kwo</em> (the great empire of Ming). In literature it is called <em>T'ien Hia</em> (Under <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>), <em>Sze Hai</em> [the four (surrounding) seas], <em>Chung Hwa Kwo</em> (the Middle Flowery Kingdom); some names refer to celebrated dynasties, <em>Hwa Hia</em> (glorious Hia), <em>Han-jen</em> or <em>Han-tze</em> (men or sons of Han), <em>T'ang-jen</em> or <em>T'ang-shan</em> (men or mountains of T'ang).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> called China <em>Sin, Chin, Mahachin, Machin</em>. The <em>Sin&aelig;</em> and <em>Seres</em> of Ptolemy and other classic writers probably represent the Chinese. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> made a distinction between Northern (Cathay) and Southern (Manzi) China. It is probable that the name China, from the Ts'in dynasty (third century B.C.), reached the West by way of <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a> and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>.
<h2>Physical features</h2>

<p>Coast and Islands The Pacific Ocean bears several names; to the south it is called Nan-Hai, or South (China) Sea, farther up the coast, Tung-hai, or Eastern Sea, and Hwang-Hai, or Yellow Sea. The coast forms a semicircle, the islands of the Che-kiang province (123x E. long. Greenwich), extending farthest east; to the north is the gulf of Chi-li and Shan-tung Peninsula; to the south the gulf of Tong-king, the Island of Hai-nan, and Lei-chou Peninsula. There are also <ul> <li>the Gulf of Liao-tung, Miao-tao Islands, the Chusan Archipelago, with Ting-hai and the celebrated <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of P'u-tu, the islands of Amoy, Sam-sa, Hai-t'an, Kin-men, T'ung-shan, Tai-wan or Formosa (now <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>); <li>Nan-hai, Mirs bay (Ta'p'ong-hai), Hiang-kiang (Hong Kong), Lappa, and Kwang-chou Bays; <li>the islands of Namoa, Hong-Kong, Lan-tao, Lamma Archipelago, the Ladrones (Lao-wan-chan), the Chw'an Islands (Shang-chw'an, also called San-cian or St. John's, where <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> died in 1552), Hia-ch'wan, and the Parcels (Ta'i-chou). </ul> The first beacon light was kindled at the mouth of the Yang-tze in 1855; the first light-house was erected on the island of Kung-tung, near Che-fu, in 1867. In 1907 the coast and ports of China had: <ul> <li>116 lighthouses, <li>5 lightships. <li>24 light boats, <li>137 buoys, <li>10 beacons, </ul> 392 in all.
<h3>Rivers</h3>

<p>The chief river is the Yang-tze, called simply Ta-Kiang (Great River) or Kiang (River); as far as the Sze-ch'wan bend it is called Kin-sha-kiang; its general course is from west to east and its length about 4000 miles. It is navigable from the ocean to I-cha'ang, and semi-navigable, on account of rapids from I'-cha'ang to P'ing-shan-hien. In the province of Sze-ch'wan its tributaries, on the left, are the Ya-lung-kiang, the Min-kiang (Ch'eng-tu River), and the Kia-ling-kiang; on the right the Ho-kiang and the Wu-kiang; in Hu-pe it receives on the left the Han-kiang; in Kiang-su it crosses the Grand Canal; near its mouth it receives the Hwang-pu or Shanghai River; at its estuary it is divided into two branches by Chung-ming Island; it waters the cities of Ching-kiang, Nan-king, Wu-hu, Ngan-king, Kiu-kiang, Han-kou, I-ch'ang, Ch'ung-king, Sui-fu, and P'ing-shan.

<p>Mention should be made of the following rivers: <ul> <li>north of the Yang-tze the Liao-ho which rises in the great K'ingan, north-east of Dolon-nor, and waters Southern <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a>; <li>the Pai-ho (Hai-ho), which flows through T'ien-tsin; at its mouth is Taku, formerly with forts at the entrance; <li>the Hwang-Ho (Yellow River) or simply the Ho, which is nearly as long as the Yang-tze, and is the scourge of China on account of its floods; in its middle course it forms a large bend, where it runs down between the provinces of Shen-si and Shan-si, encircling the regions of the Ordos country; it receives on the right its principal tributary, the large river Wei, and on the left the Fen-ho; at one time it ran into the Yellow Sea, south of the Shang-tung Peninsula, but now it follows the course of the Ts'i-ho and runs north of the peninsula; the basin of the Ho is considered the cradle of China. </ul> South of the Yang-tze are: <ul> <li>the Ts'ien-tang-kiang; <li>the Hang-chou River, celebrated on account of its bore; <li>the Min-kiang, formed by the Kien-k'i, the Shoa-wu-k'i, and the Ning-hwa-k'i; <li>the Fu-chou River. <li>The Si-kiang (West River) from Yun-nan receives on the right the Yu-kiang, already increased by the influx of the Tso-kiang, the Nan-ning River; on the left of the Liu-kiang, the Pei (North) kiang; just this side of Chao-k'ing-fu, the Si-kiang divides into a number of branches; the north branch which waters Canton is called Chu-kiang or Pearl River and flows into the sea through the Hu-men, called also the Bocca Tigris or the Bogue, into which also empties from the East the Tung-kiang. <li>The Grand or Imperial Canal, called the Yo-ho or the Yun-ho, was begun, it is said, during the sixth century B.C., and was finished only in A.D. 1283 under the Mongol dynasty; it runs from T'ien-tsin to Hang-chou, crossing the Yang-tze at Chin-kiang and is the water-course of the Great Plain. </ul>


<h3>Lakes</h3>

<p>The chief lakes are the T'ung-ting in the Hunan province and the P'o-yang in the Kiang-si, both south of the Yang-tze by the Yo-chou Canal; the latter is fed by the Kan-kiang. Mention should also be made of the Ta-hu near Su-chou (Kiang-su) and the Si-hu, near Hang-chou (Che-kiang).
<h3>Mountains</h3>

<p>The two chief mountain ranges of China, offshoots of the highlands of <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, are the Eastern Kwen-lun and the Nan-shan. The Eastern Kwen-lun include the A-la-shan and the Kan-su mountains; the Ts'in-ling, between the Hwang-ho and the Yang-tze; the Min-shan and the Kiu-lun. The Nan-shan or Nan-ling extend from Yun-nan, Kwei-chou and Kwang-si, between the Yang-tze and the Si-kiang, to Kwang-tung and Fu-kien, their last spurs appearing in the Chusan Archipelago. Mention should also be made of the O-mi-shan, i.e., Mount O-mi (in Sze-ch'wan), the Wu-t'ai-shan (north Shan-si), and the Dokerla, near Aten-tze, all celebrated pilgrim resorts. The Great Plain of China extends from T'ien-tsin to Hang-chou, forming part of the provinces of Chi-li, Ho-nan, Ngan-hwei, Kiang-su, and western Shang-tung; it may be considered the valley of the Great Canal. A certain deposit called <em>loess</em> or <em>hwang-t'u</em> (yellow earth) covers a great part of Kan-su, Shen-si, and particularly Shan-si; this tertiary formation is characterized by its tendency to split vertically and by the numerous clefts caused by erosion; the caves in this deposit are easily deepened and often serve as dwelling for the inhabitants; it is exceedingly fertile for which reasons the Shan-si province has been called the "granary of the empire".
<h2>Political geography</h2>

<p>The territorial divisions of the Chinese Empire have varied greatly at different times. Under Emperor Yu the Great and the Hia dynasty, the capital was Yang-hia (in Ho-nan), and China was divided into nine <em>chou</em>: K'e, Ts'ing, Yen, Su, Yu, Yung, Leang, King, and Yang. Under the Shang the capital was Po, near modern Kwei-t&eacute;-fu (Ho-nan), and the division remained the same. Under the Chou (1122-660 B.C.) the capitals were successively Hao (Ch'ang-ngan) and Lo-yang (781 B.C.), and there were still nine <em>chou</em>: You, Ping, Yen, Ch'ing, Ch'e, Yung, Yu, Chin, Yang. During the period covered by the "Spring and Autumn Annals" of <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> (781-519 B.C.) the capital was Lo-yang and there were the following kingdoms: Chou (1122-249), Loo (1121-248), Wei (1077-413), Ts'ai (1106-446), Tsin (1106-376), Ts'aou (1051-486). Ch'eng (805-374), Woo (1290-472), Yen (863-221), Ch'en (853-478), Sung (1077-285), T'se (1076-220), T'su (1077-222), T'sin (908-245). Under the Ts'in dynasty (220-204 B.C.) China was divided into 36 kiun. Under the Han dynasty (206 B.C. to A.D. 25) the capital was Ch'ang-ngan; there were 103 principalities, 241 marquisates, 32 <em>tao</em> or provinces, 1314 <em>hien</em>. Under the Eastern Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220), there were 13 <em>chou</em> and the capital was Lo-yang. The capitals of China were in turn or at the same time: Lo-Yang (Wei dynasty), Ch'eng-tu (Shu of Sze-ch'wan), Kien-kang, or Nan-king (Wu), Hang-chou (Southern Sung, 420-477), Ta-tung (Northern Wei, 386-532), Ch'ang-ngan (Sui, 581-618), Lo-yang (T'ang, 618-907), K'ai-feng and Hang-chou (Sung, 960-1126), Peking, called Yen-king under the Kin, and Cambalue under the Yuan. During the Mongol period China was divided into ten sheng or provinces; under the Ming dynasty there were fifteen sheng, Kan-su having been taken from Shen-si, Kiang-nan being divided into Kiang-su and Ngan-hwei, and Hu-kwang into Hu-pe and Hu-nan. There are now eighteen provinces. At one time Formosa formed one province; Kiang-hwai, or Northern Kiang-su, was temporarily detached from Kiang-su (1905).

<h2>Ethnography</h2>

<p>It would be a great mistake to think that the Chinese people are all of one race. The ordinary Chinaman is of middle size, strongly built, with a round, full face, high cheekbones, a short, depressed nose, thick lips, and fine teeth. His eyes are black and often oblique, his complexion varying between pale white and dark brown; his forehead shaven, and his coarse black hair hanging down his back in a plait; his <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a> is black and scanty, his feet small. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Chinaman, that is to say, the native of the central provinces, from the banks of the Hwang-ho and lower Yang-tze, differs greatly from his countrymen of the maritime provinces of Kwang-tung and Fu-kien. Not only are there racial differences between the various types of Chinese, but still further differences arise from the various people living on the borders as well as in the provinces. On the north, the Tatars, Manchus, and Mongols, on the west the Tibetans are important groups. The Chinese call the non-Chinese tribes "barbarians", or Yi, Fan, and Man; the term Yi was used to designate <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> and was prohibited by Article 51 of the British Treaty of T'ien tsin (1858); Fan-lao or Fan-jen according to S. W. Williams was used at Canton for foreigners; the general names Man and Mantze are employed more particularly in the West and South and include such non-Chinese as the Yao, Chwang, Tho, Lolo, or Y-kia, Chung-kia, Si-fan, Miao tribes, etc. dispersed through Sze-ch'wan and Yun-nan, while the Hakkas reside in Kwang-tung. There are also savage tribes in Formosa, on the western slope of the central range of mountains.

<p>The queue (<em>pien-tze</em>) worn by the Chinese and so characteristic of the race, was imported by Manchu conquerors in 1627. To compress the feet of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> is far from being a universal custom, and has no connection with position or fortune, Manchu ladies (i.e., those of imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>) and most of the southern <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> do not treat their feet in this unnatural way; there are no trustworthy data as to the origin of this torture, which goes back, some say, to A.D. 583. A few years ago some <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> ladies started an anti foot-binding movement under the name of <em>Tien Tsu Hwei</em>, which seems to have met with a fair amount of success. Some Chinese, especially scholars, wear extraordinarily long nails, which are intended to show their owners are above manual labor. Sometimes they sheath their nails with brass of silver.
<h2>Government</h2>

<p>Since the beginning of the fifteenth century the seat of government has been Peking (northern court), its name being Shun-tien-fu in the Chi-li province; the southern court (Nan-king) was Kiang-ning in the Kiang-su province, the capital of the empire in the beginning of the Ming dynasty. The emperor is styled Hwang-ti (emperor) or Hwang-sheng, Wan-sui Yeh, Tien-tze (son of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>), T'ien-wang (heavenly prince); the empress is styled Hwang-heu or Chung-kung; where there are two empresses they are designated Tung-kung and Si-kung (respectively eastern and western, according to the part of the palace they live in. The heir apparent is the Hwang-t'ai-tze; the hereditary imperial nobility include: <ul> <li>T'sin-wang, prince of the first order; <li>Kiun-wang, of the second order; <li>Pei-leh (Bei-leh) of the third order; <li>Pei-tze, of the fourth order; <li>Fung-ngen Chen Kwo-kung, duke of the first order; <li>Fung-ngen Fu Kwo-kung, of the second order; <li>Pu-ju, Pa-fen Chen Kwo-kung, of the third order; <li>Pu-ju, Pa-fen Fu Kwo-kung, of the fourth order; <li>Chen-Kwo Tsaing-kiun, <li>Fu-Kwo Tsaing-kiun, <li>Fung-Kwo Tsaing-kiun, and <li>Fung-ngen Tsiang-kiun, generalissimos of the first, second, third, and fourth classes respectively. </ul> The Tsung-shi are the imperial clansmen, descendants of Hien Tsu (1583-1615), the founder of the Manchu dynasty, and are distinguished by their yellow girdles; all affairs relating to the imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> are treated by the Tsung-jen-fu, the Imperial Clan Court. There are eight princely <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> with perpetual inheritance: <ul> <li>Li T'sin-wang, Prince of Li; <li>Jui T'sin-wang, Prince of Jui; <li>Yu T'sin-wang, Prince of Yu; <li>Su T'sin-wang, Prince of Su; <li>Cheng T'sin-wang, Prince of Cheng; <li>Chwang T'sin-wang, Prince of Chwang; <li>Shun-ch'&eacute;ng Kiun-wang, Prince of Shun-ch'&eacute;ng; <li>K'e-k'in Kiun-wang, Prince of K'e-k'in. </ul> I Ts'in Wang, Prince of I, not included in the eight, is also perpetual.

<p>The central government includes: (1) the Kiun-ki Ch'u, Council of State, created by Yung Ch&eacute;ng in April, 1732, including a few <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and sixty secretaries, Chang-king; (2) the Nei-ko or Grand Secretariat, including four grand secretaries, Ta-heo-she of Chung T'ang, two Manchus, and two Chinese, each designated by one of the pavilions of the Imperial Palace: Wen Hwa-tien, Wu Ying-tien, T'i Jen-ko, Tung-ko; under the Ming dynasty the Chung T'ang were called Ko-lao; this was the title of the celebrated Paul Siu (Siu K'wang-k'i); two assistant grand secretaries styled Hie-pan Ta-hio-she; (3) the ministerial boards or Liu Pu, which, prior to 1906, numbered six: Li Pu, Board of Civil Appointments; Hu Pu, Board of Review; Li Pu, Board of Rites; Ping Pu, board of War; Hing Pu, Board of Justice; Kung Pu, Board of Public Works. The Yo Pu or Board of State Music is a dependency of the Board of Rites. Some of these boards or ministries have been remodelled, and new ones created since 1906, and they now include, besides the Wai-wu Pu, the following boards: Li Pu, the Board of Civil Office; the Min-cheng Pu, Board of Home Affairs; the Tu-chi Pu, Board of Finance; Hio Pu, Board of Education or of Public Instruction; Fa Pu, Board of Justice; Lu-kiun Pu, Ministry of War; Nung-kung-shang Pu, Board of Agriculture, Works, and Commerce; the Yu-chw'an Pu, board of Posts and Communications, including steam navigations, posts, and telegraphs; Li Pu, Board of Rites; Siun-king Pu, Board of Public Safety. Previous to 1906, each board had two presidents (Shang-su), Manchu and Chinese, two senior vice-presidents, (Tso She-Lang), and two junior vice-presidents, (Yeo She-Lang); there are now one president and two vice-presidents. The Tsung-li Ko Kwo-she-wu Yamen, commonly called Tsung-li Yamen, the Foreign Office, was created by Hien Fung, 20 January, 1861, after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; previously foreign affairs had been dealt with by the Li Fan-yuan, board for the administration of vassal countries, controlling <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, etc., and formerly <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; the Li Fan-yuan has now become a ministry of colonies; the Tsung-li Yamen was replaced (23 July, 1901) by the Wai-wu Pu. The Court of Censors or Censorate (Tu Ch'a Yuan) has two presidents (Tu Yu-she), four vice-presidents, twenty-four supervising censors (Liu k'o), divided into six boards, and thirty-eight censors (Yu-che) distributed over fifteen Tao or circuits. The Han-lin Yuan, college of academicians, has two presidents (Chang-yuan Hio-she). There are also the Kwo Tze Kien or imperial college, and K'in-t'ien Kien, or board of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, etc.
<h2>Provincial administration</h2>

<p>There are eighteen provinces (Shi-pa-sheng); these sheng are divided into Tao (circuits), Fu (prefectures), T'ing (independent sub-prefectures), Chou, and Hien; independent Chou are called Chi-li Chou. The Eighteen Provinces, together with Sin-kiang, are under eight governors general or viceroys (Tsung-tu or Che-t'ai) and twelve governors, three of whom are independent. The eight viceroyalities are the Chi-li, Liang-kiang (including Kiang-su, Ngan-hwei, and Kiang-si), Min-che (Fu-kien, Che-kiang), Liang-hou (Hu-pe, Hu-nan), Liang-kwang (Kwang-tung, Kwang-si), Yun-kwei (Yun-nan, Kwei-chou), Shen-kan (Shen-si, Kan-su), and Sze-ch'wan. Each province is presided over by a governor, (Siun-fu, Fu-t'ai) except Chi-li, Fu-kien, Kan-su, Sze-ch'wan, Kwang-tung, Yun-nan, and Kan-su; there is one in Sin-kiang; the Fu-t'ai of Shang-tung, Shan-si, and Ho-nan are not under a governor-general, but are directly under Peking. Immediately after the governor are the high provincial treasurer (Pu-cheng She-sze or Fan-t'ai), the high provincial judge (Ngan-ch'a She-sze or Nieh-t'ai), the salt controller (Yen-yun She-sze), and the grain intendant (Liang-tao); these various officials constitute each provincial government under the collective name of Tu-fu Sze-tao. Next in order come the Fen-siun Tao; the intendant of a circuit (Tao-t'ai--98 in all), the prefect of a Fu (Che-fu--181), the T'ung-che (170); the T'ung-p'an (141); the Che-chou (140); the Che Hien, district magnate (1290); there is a Hio-cheng (Hio-yuan, Hio-t'ai), or provincial director of instruction in each province, who presides at the prefectural examinations.

<p>The Chinese functionaries known to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> as Mandarin (from <em>mandar</em>, to command) are called Kwan by the Chinese; there are nine ranks of kwan, divided into civil and military officials, who are distinguished by the button worn on the official hat, by the square <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> badge on the breast and back of official robes (a bird for the civil, a quadruped for the military, and by the clasp of the girdle. 

<p>A provincial official down to Tao-t'ai inclusive is styled Ta-jen (great man); from Che Fu to Che Hien, the name is Ta Lao-ye (great old father); for the rest Lao-ye (old father). Various forms of distinction are awarded for public services; the principle if the Ling-che (the feather) of which there are three grades corresponding to degrees of distinction: the three-eyed, the two-eyed, and the one-eyed peacock feather (K'ung Tsio-ling) and the crow feather (Lan-ling, blue feather). The chief distinction for military men is the Hing-kwa or Hwang-ma-kwa (yellow riding jacket). There are nine degrees of nobility, either transmissible to a certain number of ancestors or descendants (she-si), or hereditary forever (she-si-wang): <ul> <li> Kung (duke), <li> Hou (marquis), <li> Pe (earl--together designated as Ch'ao P'in), <li> Tze (viscount), <li> Nan (baron), <li> K'ing-ch'e Tu-yu, <li> K'i-tu-yu, <li> Yun-k'i-yu. </ul> The translations sometimes given the first five titles are indicated in parentheses. The residence of a mandarin holding a seal is called <em>Yamen</em>; that of a mandarin without a seal, <em>Kung-su</em>.
<h2>Education</h2>

<p>Formerly Chinese children, after being taught to read and write, had to learn such elementary books as the "San-tze-king" (Three-Character Classic), the "Pe-kia-sing" (Hundred Family Names), and the "T'sien-tze-wen" (One Thousand-Character Classic); later they studied the "Sze Shu" or "Four Classical Books". Memory was developed at the expense of critical faculty, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> being almost entirely neglected. A good calligraphy and a thorough <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucian</a> classic were the main requisites for passing an examination, in which an essay on texts selected from these three classic, and called <em>wen-chang</em>, played a considerable part. The wen-chang, suppressed in 1898 during the short period of reform, has been definitely abolished. The civil offices were recruited from those who passed the three examinations: Hiang-she (provincial), held triennially in the autumn; Hwai-she (metropolitan) held at Peking, in the spring; Tien-she, the palace examination. The student (T'ung-sheng) took in succession the three degrees: Siu-ts'ai, Ku-jen, and Tsin-she; at the last examination the first four competitors received the titles of Chwang Yuan, Pang yen, T'an Hwa, and Ch'wan Lu.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, China felt the necessity of a thorough change; <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucianism</a> was no longer a sufficient weapon against Western enterprise. Elementary, higher primary, middle, higher, and special <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were established on foreign principles. A <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and a technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were opened at Peking, while young students were sent abroad, especially to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. It must be admitted that the latter brought back from the Empire of the Rising Sun an entirely new spirit. They have been responsible, to a great extent, for the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a>, which aim not only at reform, but also at the overthrow of the present dynasty. By an imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which was <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 2 Sept., 1905, and went into effect at the beginning of 1906, the former programme and methods of examination were abolished, and a new system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> inaugurated. This includes the study of the Chinese language, literature, and composition, the various <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> studied in the West, history, geography, foreign languages, especially <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, gymnastic exercises and drills, and in the higher grades the study of political economy, and civil and <a href="../cathen/09073a.htm">international law</a>. As a natural consequence, new degrees corresponding to <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B.A.</a>, M.A., LL.D., etc. were created. It is evident that the Chinese attitude of mind is undergoing a great change through contact with Western <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and learning; what is less evident is that deeper layers of the nation have not been reached.
<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>Chinese philosophy, at least in what is fundamental, is embodied in the religious books, or rather in the classical works called "King". <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> was more of a collector than a creator; he was a moral teacher, imbued with traditions he had studied and mastered, and of which he was the ideal representative, but he was no inventor. The man who stamped Chinese philosophy with his strong <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, or rather his genius, was the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Chu Hi (A.D. 1130-1200), born in Fu-kien during the Sung dynasty. He had a retreat for intervals of meditation at the White Deer Grotto in the hills near P'o-Yang lake. The "Book of Changes" (Y-king) begins with the <em>T'ai-ki</em>, the Great Absolute; according to Chu Hi there was in the beginning the primordial principle, the abstract <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">monad</a> called the "absolute nothing", <em>Wu-ki</em>. When moving, the Great Absolute produced by the congealing of its breath, the <em>Yang</em>, the great male principle; when it finally rested in produced the <em>Yin</em>, or the great <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> principle; after this great division what was above was <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, beneath was earth, and during the subsequent evolutions and movement were created in turn, the sun and the moon, the stars and the planets, water and fire, men and animals, vegetables and minerals, etc. Four <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> regulate the present movement of the two principles: (1) <em>Hi</em>, the breath of nature, governed not by arbitrary but by fixed, inscrutable <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; (2) <em>Li</em>, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature; (3) <em>So</em>, the numbers or numerical proportions of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; (3) <em>Ying</em>, the appearance of forms of nature.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system is represented by diagrams. Sometimes the three powers of nature (<em>San-t'sai</em>), i.e., <em>T'ien</em> (<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>), <em>Ti</em> (Earth), <em>Jen</em> (Man), are indicated by a triangle. The two primitive principles are shown, the first by a straight line _____ which corresponds to Yang, the male principle, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, light, etc.; the second by a broken line __ __ which corresponds to Yin, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> principle, earth, darkness, etc. Combinations of these lines give the following four figures: <blockquote>

<p>(1) <br>_______ <br>_______

<p>(2) <br>_______ <br>___ ___

<p>(3) <br>___ ___ <br>_______

<p>(4) <br>___ ___ <br>___ ___ </blockquote>

<p>(1) <em>T'ai Yang</em>, corresponding to sun, heat, eyes, etc.; (2) The <em>T'ai Yin</em> corresponding to the moon, cold, ears, etc.; (3) The <em>Shao Yang</em> corresponding to the stars, daylight, the nose, etc.; (4) The <em>Shao Yin</em> corresponding to the planets, night, the mouth, etc.

<p>A new combination of these figures was revealed to Fu-hi (2852-2738 B.C.), by a dragon-horse which rose from the Yellow River and presented to the gaze of the emperor a scroll upon its back inscribed with mystic diagrams which, being arranged, consisted of eight trigrams or symbols called <em>Pa-kwa</em>: <blockquote>

<p>(1) <br>_____ <br>_____ <br>_____

<p>(2) <br>__ __ <br>_____ <br>_____

<p>(3) <br>_____ <br>__ __ <br>_____

<p>(4) <br>__ __ <br>__ __ <br>_____

<p>(5) <br>_____ <br>_____ <br>__ __

<p>(6) <br>__ __ <br>_____ <br>__ __

<p>(7) <br>_____ <br>__ __ <br>__ __

<p>(8) <br>__ __ <br>__ __ <br>__ __ </blockquote>

<p>(1) Corresponds to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and the pure male principle, being entirely composed of whole lines; (2) vapours, watery exhalations, lakes; (3) fire, heat, light; (4) thunder; (5) wind; (6) water; (7) mountains; (8) earth and pure feminine principle, being entirely composed of broken lines. An octagonal arrangement devised by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the Sung dynasty gives the figures called <em>Sien-tien.</em>

<p>Shen-nung, the second of the Five Emperors, is held to have multiplied by eight the original Kwa of Fu-hi, forming sixty-four hexagrams. This number multiplied by six gives 384, the maximum to which the calculations can be carried practically, though it is stated that a series of 16,777,216 different forms can be obtained. The two principles forming the Tai-ki were sometimes represented by two opposite semi-circles in a circle, the two portions of the circle in dark and clear respectively; later on a dark disk was inserted in the clear portion and a clear disk in the dark portions.

<p>The male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> principles may also be represented by a circle and a square; for instance at Peking the Temple of Heaven is circular while the Temple of Earth is square; the common coin called <em>cash</em> being round with a square hole in the centre is a perfect symbol of Heaven and Earth.
<h2>Classics</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">doctrine of Confucius and his school</a> is contained in the classical books called "King". Five of the classics of the highest grade include: (1) The "Y-king" (Book of Changes) with 24,107 characters; (2) the "Shu-king" (Book of History) in fifty-eight chapters with 25,700 characters extends from the Emperors Yao and Shun to Ping Wang of the Chou dynasty (720 B.C.); (3) the "She-king" (Book of Odes) with 39,234 characters, a collection of popular poetry used in the petty states of China, collected and arranged by <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a>; (4) the "Li-ki" (Book of Rites) in forty-nine chapters (including the "Ta-hio" and the "Chung-yung",) 99,010 characters; (5) the "Ch'un-ts'ew" (Spring and Autumn), or the annals of Lu, the native state of <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a>, from 722 to 484 B.C. The "Yo-king" (Book of Music) was lost. Next came the lesser "King": (1) the "Sze-shu" (Four Books), "Ta-hio" (Great Study), "Chung-yung" (Invariable Medium), "Lun-yu" (miscellaneous conversations between <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> and his disciples), and "Meng-tze", the conversation of the sage <a href="../cathen/10179a.htm">Mencius</a> (34,685 characters; with the commentary 209,749); (2) the two rituals, "I-li and "Chou-li" (45,806 characters); (3) the Hiao-king" (Book of Filial Piety with 1903 characters); (4) the three ancient commentators of the "Ch'un-ts'ew": "Tso-shi", "Kung-yang", and "Ku-liang"; (5) the "Eul-ya" (Library Exposition), a dictionary of terms used in the classical writing of the same period. It must be borne in mind that <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> was an administrator, a statesman, in a word, a practical man, as well as a moralist, but not entirely devoid of originality.

<p>The most distinguished followers of <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> (b. 551; d. 479 B.C.) were Tsang-shen (506 B.C.) and <a href="../cathen/10179a.htm">Meng-tze</a> (<a href="../cathen/10179a.htm">Mencius</a>, 372-289 B.C.). The rival of <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> was Lao-tze, or Lao-kiun, a far deeper <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, author of the "Tao-teh-king" and of the "Kan-ying-pien", with his disciples, Kang-sang-tze (570-43 B.C.), Li-tze (500 B.C.), and Wen-tze (500 B.C.). The heterodox <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were Meh-ti (450 B.C.) and Yang-chu (450 B.C.); the Taoists, Chwang-tze (330 B.C.) and Hwai-nan-tze (second century B.C.). Mention should also be made of Wang-ch'ung, author of the "Lun-h&eacute;ng" (first century A.D.), Han-yu, or Han Wen-Kung (A.D. 768-824), and finally, under the Sung, the reformer Wang Ngan-shi (1021-86) and the illustrious Chu-hi (A.D. 1130-1200).
<h2>State religions</h2>

<p>The three state <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of China (<em>San-kiao</em> or three doctrines), are <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucianism</a>, Taoism, and <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>.--Confucianism or <em>Ju-kiao</em> (a name adopted by the disciples of Chu-hi in in A.D. 1150) is the religion of the <em>literati</em>; from the moral principles taken from the books arranged by <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> a state religion has been created; the Trinity (<em>San-ts'ai</em>), <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, Earth, and Man is represented by the emperor, <em>T'ien-tze</em>, Son of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, the high-priest of the cult who pays his homage at the winter solstice at midnight and to the earth at the summer solstice. The state worship includes three grades of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, the victims being things, though <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are not excluded: (1) the great <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered only to <em>T'ien</em> (<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>), <em>Ti</em> (Earth), <em>Tai Miao</em> (the great temple of ancestors) and <em>Shieh-tsi</em> (gods of the land and grain); (2) the medium <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, an homage to the sun, the moon, the names of emperors and kings of foreign dynasties, <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a>, the ancient patrons of agriculture and silk, the gods of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, earth, and the cyclic year; (3) the inferior <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> (<em>Kiun-sze</em>, crowd of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>) offered to the patron of medicine, the spirits of celebrated men, the clouds, rain, wind, and thunder, the five celebrated mountains, the four seas, four rivers, etc. The supreme ruler of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is Shiang-ti. There is no <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucianism</a>.

<p>Taoism, or <em>Tao-kiao</em>, was invented by the disciples of Lao-tze, but the lofty theories of this <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> have denigrated to the grossest <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>, <a href="../cathen/01272b.htm">alchemy</a>, <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, and a worship of a pantheon of idols, the highest of which is Yu-hwang Shang-ti; the chief of the Taoists resides at Lung-hu-shan (Kiang-si); most of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are extremely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.

<p>Buddhism, or <em>Fo-kiao</em>, the religion of Fo (Buddha) comes from <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>; it is said to have reached China in 221 or 219 B.C., but this is hardly probable. The first certain fact regarding Chinese <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> is that it was orally taught in the year 2 B.C. to an ambassador of the Emperor Ngai by the <em>Ta Yue-chi</em> or Indo-Scythians; it was officially recognized by the emperor Ming-ti (A.D. 61). The search for <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> led <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> like Fa-hian and Sung-yun (<em>Fo-kwo-ki</em>), Hwei-shin, the celebrated Hiuan-tsang (seventh century), I-tsing, Wang-Hiuan-ts'e, Wu-k'ung and others to undertake long voyages which have thrown great light on the geography of Northern <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and Central <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. In spite of their exertions and of the numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> they brought home, it was not until 1410 that the Chinese procured a complete copy of the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> canon; some of the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> sanctuaries are famous places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>: the island of P'u-tu (Chu-san), the Wu T'ai-shan (Shan-si); the Omei-shan (Sze-ch'an), the Dokerla (Yun-nan). The <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> gather in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; the superiors of a district or a prefecture are called <em>Seng-lu-tze</em>; they are selected from the leading <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> (<em>fang-chang</em>); besides the superiors (<em>Seng-kang, Seng-chen, Seng-hwei</em>), there are preceptors, preachers, expositors, and clerks. <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, with its numerous <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, is the most popular religion of China, though a member of one <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> very often borrows practices from the others cults and, if an official, will invariably perform the ceremonies of <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucianism</a>. Whatever be the importance of these three <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, they are insignificant compared to the real, national religion of all Chinese &#151; ancestor-worship.

<p>Ancestor worship originated in filial <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which, being of paramount importance in the eyes of the Chinese, is the object of a special book, the "Hiao-king". Filial <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, however, is not a natural, spontaneous feeling, but a well-defined <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, embracing the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> towards the emperor, princes, officials, <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and these vary according to the classes and people. In every house there is a tablet, if not a room; a rich <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> has a separate building; this is the hall of ancestors; the tablets are called <em>p'ai-wei</em> and the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> <em>tze-t'ang</em>. During the period called <em>tsing-ming</em>, in the first part of April, a general worship of ancestors takes place in the form of libations, and the burning of candles, paper and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>; this cult was prohibited the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 1742.

<p>Another great and popular <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> is <em>Fung-shui</em> (wind and water). To describe this is impossible, though it is the daily guide in a Chinaman's life. It is a system of geomancy founded on the "Y-king", systematized in the twelfth century; the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of a marriage, the proper place for a burial ground, a lucky site for a building, etc., the settlement of all these questions depends on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <em>Fung-shui</em> laid down by the professors, who besides a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> and Taoist doctrines, had some superficial <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> regarding natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, medicine, and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>.
<h2>Foreign relations</h2>

<p>Some commentators have found China in this passage of <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> (<a href="../bible/isa049.htm#vrs12">49:12</a>): "these from the land of Sinim." Ptolemy divides Eastern <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> into the country of Sin&aelig; and Serice, north of Sin&aelig;, with its chief city Sera. Strabo, Virgil, Horace, Pomponius Mela, Pliny, and Ammianus, speak of the <em>Seres</em>, and they are mentioned by Florence among the nations which sent special embassies to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the time of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>. The Chinese call the eastern part of the Roman Empire (Syria, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>) <em>Ta Ts'in, Fu-lin</em> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Cosmos had a correct <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the position of China (sixth century. The Byzantine writer, Theophylactus Simocatta (seventh century) gave an account of China under the name <em>Taugas</em>. There is a Chinese record of a Roman embassy in A.D. 166. The sea voyages of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of Chinese <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a> have thrown considerable light on the geography of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>The voyage of <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a> (1497) and the capture of <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a> by Albuquerque opened the Far East to the Portuguese, who arrived in Canton in 1514; Perestrello came in 1516; Fern&iuml;o Perez de Andrade followed in 1517 with Thomas Pires, but the misconduct of Simon de Andrade caused the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> from Canton (1521) and the destruction of the fleet of Cautinho (1522); the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> establishment of Liampo (1545) and Chang-chou (1549) were completely destroyed, and the inhabitants massacred. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> settled on the island of Hiang-shan at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, either in 1553 or 1557. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> commander Cornellus Reyersz took the Pescadore Islands in 1624; but after an agreement made with the Chinese (19 Feb., 1625), Martin Sonk, the governor, transferred the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> colony to Tai-wan (Formosa), where it was captured by the Chinese pirate, Koxinga (1661). The capture in 1592 of the Portuguese Carrack, Madre de Dios, gave the English the secret of the East-Indian Trade. In 1596, three ships, the Bear, the Bear's Whelp, and the Benjamin, under the command of Benjamin Wood, were fitted out at the expense of Robert Dudley, and Queen Elizabeth wrote a letter (16 July) to the Emperor of China. The first English vessel that visited China reached there by accident. It was the Unicorn which, going from Bantam to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, was cast by a storm on the east coast of <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, at the end of June, 1620. In 1634 Captain Weddell explored the Canton River. The first English company organized for the purpose of trading with <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, commonly called the "Old Company" was incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, 31 Dec., 1600, under the title "The Govenour and Company of Merchants of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> trading into the East Indies. The "English Company (or General Society) trading into the East Indies" also called the "New Company" was incorporated by William III, 5 Sept., 1698, and the two were amalgamated in 1708-9 by Queen Anne, under the title of "The United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies", commonly known as the "Honourable East <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> Company".

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> crossed the Ural mountains in the middle of the sixteenth century under Ivan IV and subjugated Siberia; from the Lena River they passed, in 1642, into the basin of Amur. Stephanof, one of their chiefs, met the Chinese for the first time in 1654, when exploring the Sungari River. After withstanding two sieges of their principal fort, Albasin, the Russians signed a treaty with the Chinese at Nerchinsk (27 Aug., 1689), which destroyed their influence in the region of Amur, and from which they did not recover until the middle of the nineteenth century. In 1727 Count Sava Vladislavitch signed a treaty regulating the inland trade between the two countries.

<p>In 1660 the French organized a "Compagnie de Chine" which in 1664 was amalgamated with the "Compagnie des Indes" which gave up its China privileges in 1697-98 to "Compagnie Jourdan, la Coulange et Cie", which made Canton a trading centre. New companies were organized for the commerce of China in October, 1705, and November, 1712. Finally, in 1719, all the companies were merged into the "Compagnie des Indes", whose privilege was suspended in 1769, and which was finally dissolved, 3 April, 1790. A French consulate was established at Canton 3 Feb., 1776. The Danes had two companies organized in 1612 and 1670. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was represented by the Ostend Company, incorporated 17 Dec., 1722, and the Triest Company. <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had the Emden Company. In 1627 a <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> company was organized; in 1655 Nils Matson Ki&ouml;ping visited China. On 14 June, 1731, a charter was granted by King Frederick of Sweden to a company organized at Gothenburg. The first American commercial expedition to China was undertaken by the Empress of China, a vessel commanded by John Green, which sailed from New York for Canton, 22 Feb., 1784.

<p>Trading was carried on at Canton through privileged merchants called <em>Hong</em> merchants, whose council, called <em>Co-hong</em>, was incorporated in 1720. Their number carried, but never exceeded thirteen. The foreign merchants traded in thirteen <em>hongs</em>, or factories, extending about 300 feet from the banks of the Pearl River, and about 1000 broad. The Hong merchants, hard pressed by the <em>Hoppo</em>, or custom mandarin, ran into <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> with the foreign merchants. A visit of Commodore Anson (1742), a special mission of Captain Panton, even a transfer to another part of the empire, did not remedy the numerous grievances of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, who were not allowed to reside permanently at Canton, but were compelled to retire to Macao when business was done. The English sent an embassy, headed by Lord Macartney, in the Lion and the Hindostan. Macartney reached Peking 21 Aug., 1793, but did not obtain permission for the English to trade at Chusan, Ning-po, and T'ien-tsin, or to have a warehouse at Peking for their goods. Macartney's voyage cost &uacute;80,000 (about $380,000), but was without result. Still less successful was the embassy of Lord Amherst (1816). Lord Napier, who was sent on special mission in 1833-4, died worn out by his negotiations. Grievances continued to increase year after year, until the destruction (June, 1839) of 20,283 chests of opium by Commander Lin brought matters to a climax.

<p>On 9 June, 1840, a blockade of the Canton River was proclaimed by Admiral Sir John Gordon Bremer. Ting-hai (Chusan) was captured, 7 July, 1841. Sir Henry Pottinger was now appointed plenipotentiary, and Sir William Parker commander-in-chief. Amoy was captured 27 August, Ning-po 13 Oct., 1841, Shanghai, 16 June, 1842, and the British squadron entered the Ta-kiang (Yang-tze). Finally a treaty of thirteen articles was signed at Nan-king by Pottinger and Ki-yang, 29 August, 1842, on board the Cornwallis. Canton, Amoy, Fu-chou, Ning-po, and Shanghai were to be opened to trade, and consuls appointed to reside at each of these cities. The island of Hong-Kong was ceded to Great Britain, and indemnities were paid: $6,000,000 for the opium seized, $12,000,000 for the expenses of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and $3,000,000 for the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> of the Hong merchants, whose guild was abolished. The <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> followed the example of Great Britain. A treaty was signed with the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> at Wang-hia, near <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, 3 July, 1844, by Caleb Cushing, and one with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by Th&eacute;odose de Lagren&eacute; at Wham-poa, 24 Oct., 1844. An agreement with <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> was signed at Canton, 25 July, 1845, and a treaty with <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> and Sweden, 20 March, 1847. The Chusan Archipelago was surrendered to the Chinese in 1847 by Sir John F. Davis, Governor of Hong-Kong. Hong-Kong had been declared a free port, 6 Feb., 1842 to the great damage of <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>.

<p>The advantages, however, obtained through the treaty of Nan-king were soon found insufficient. The <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Chapdelaine in Kwang-si (26 Feb., 1856) and the seizure at Canton of the lorcha Arrow (8 Oct., 1856) by the Chinese furnished the pretext for a joint action of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> against China. The bombardment of Canton (27-29 Oct, 1856), the great rebellion in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (May, 1857), the appointment of Lord Elgin and Baron Gros as envoys to China by the two belligerents, the capture of Canton (29 Dec., 1857) and of the Taku forts (20 May, 1858), are the chief events which preceded the signing of the English (26 June) and French (27 June, 1858) treaties of T'ien-tsin. These treaties permitted the appointment of French and English ambassadors to Peking, and allowed the Chinese a like privilege of appointing ambassadors at the Court of St. James and the court of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, provided for the opening of the ports of New-chwang, Tang-chou (Che-fu), Tai-wan (Formosa), Chao-chou (Swatow), and Kiung-chou (Hai-nan), granted an indemnity of 2,000,000 taels for damages to the British and a like sum to both powers for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> expenses, besides an indemnity to French subjects for the loss sustained through plunder, when Canton was taken, and guaranteed the punishment of the murderer of Father Chapdelaine.

<p>On the 25th of June, 1859, the plenipotentiaries, Bruce and Bourboulon, who were on their way to Peking to have these treaties ratified, were fired upon by the Taku forts. A second <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> ensued. Elgin and Gros were appointed special envoys to China; Sir Hope Grant and Admiral Hope, General de Mountauban and Admiral Charner were placed in command of the British and French land and naval forces. The forts of Taku were recaptured (21 Aug., 1860). The allies marched passed T'ien-tsin, and after withstanding a treacherous attack by the Chinese at Tung-chou (18 Sept., 1860), they forced a passage across the Pa-li-k'iao bridge (21 Sept.), and captured the Summer Palace (Yuan-ming-yuan), 6 Oct., which was plundered. Wan-shou-shan, another part of the imperial summer resort, was burnt by order of Lord Elgin (18 Oct.) on account of the barbarous treatment inflicted upon the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> taken in the dastardly attack at Tung-chou. The emperor fled to Shehol, and his brother, Prince Kung, who had remained at Peking, signed the Conventions of 24 and 25 Oct., 1860, with the allies. The indemnity was raised to 8,000,000 taels, and Kow-loon, opposite Hong-Kong, was ceded to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as a dependency of this island. A like indemnity was to be paid to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and T'ien-tsin was to be opened to trade. Meanwhile a treaty had been made at T'ien-tsin with the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (18 June, 1858), signed by William B. Reed, and one with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> (13 June, 1858) signed by Admiral Putiatin, and another treaty was made with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> at Peking (9-14 Nov., 1860), and signed by General Ignatiev. A still earlier treaty had been made with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> at Aigun (18 May, 1858) and signed by Muraviev. The final result of these various treaties was a rectification of the frontier between <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and China, the Amur and Usuri rivers forming the new boundary lines.

<p>The wretched Hien Fung, who had replaced Tao-kwang in 1851, died 22 Aug., 1861, and was succeeded by his son T'ung-chi (b. 17 Nov., 1834), under the regency of the two dowager empresses, Tze-ngan and Tze-hi, and Prince Kung. With the help of foreigners, the American, Ward, the English general, Gordon, and the "Ever Victorious Army", the French admiral Protet, Lebrethon, and others, the T'ai-p'ing rebels, who had captured Nan-king (19 March, 1853) and made a raid on T'ien-tsin, were expelled from Su-chou (4 Dec., 1863) and Nan-king (19 July, 1864), and their power completely destroyed. Treaties were signed with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and the German States (T'ien-tsin, 2 Sept., 1861), <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (T'ien-tsin, 13 Aug., 1862), though not ratified, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> (T'ien-tsin, 13 July, 1863), <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (T'ien-tsin, 10 Oct, 1864), <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> (T'ien-tsin, 6 Oct., 1863), <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (Peking, 2 Oct., 1865), <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (26 Oct., 1866), and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (Peking, 2 Oct., 1869). A new convention, negotiated by the British minister, Sir Rutherford Alcock, (Peking, 23 Oct., 1869), was not ratified by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government. In 1868, a special embassy headed by Anson Burlingame, formerly American Minister to Peking, was sent to the Western countries. They went first to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. and additional articles to the Treaty of 1858 were signed at Washington (28 July, 1868); thence they proceeded through <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Burlingame died at St. Petersburg. A few months afterward news was received of the awful massacre of French and Russian subjects by the Chinese at T'ien-tsin, 21 June, 1870. A mission under Chung-hou was sent to Versailles to apologize for this. T'ung-chi married, Oct., 1872, and being of age, received in audience the foreign envoys; <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">Great Britain</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> were represented by their <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by an interpreter (29 June, 1873). Relations were strained between <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> and China, owing to an attack made by the aborigines of southern Formosa on the wrecked crew of a Luch'uan junk, and for a time <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> seemed inevitable. Through British intervention however, satisfaction was obtained by <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, and an agreement between the two <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> nations was signed at Peking, 31 Oct., 1874. T'ung-chi died 12 Jan, 1875.

<p>The situation in China at this time presented many difficulties. There were grave questions to be settled with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. On 21 Feb., 1875, the English interpreter, A. R. Margary, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at Manwyne (Yun-nan), and an attack was made on the British exploring party from <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a> headed by Colonel Horace A. Browne, which Margary had preceded. Protracted and knotty negotiations conducted by the British minister, Thomas F. Wade, led to the conclusion of the convention signed at Che-fu, 13 Sept., 1876. According to this: regulations were to be framed for the frontier trade of Yun-nan; British officials were to be stationed at Ta-li, or some other suitable place in Yun-nan, for a period of five years; the viceroy of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> was given permission to send a mission to this province; the indemnity was fixed at 200,000 taels; China was to establish missions and consulates abroad; the ports of I'ch'ang, Wu-hu, Wen-chou, and Pak-hoi were to be opened to trade; British officers might be sent to Ch'ung-k'ing which was to be opened to trade when steamers succeeded in ascending the river. A special mission, including Hon. G.T. Grosvenor, A. Davenport, and E.C. Baber, was sent to Yun-nan to witness the trial and the punishment of the murderers of Margary. On 28 August 1875, Kwo Sung-tao was appointed envoy extraordinary to the Court of St. James.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a>, who had signed a treaty with China, 25 July, 1851, at Kuldja, took possession of this region (4 July, 1871), during the rebellion of Yakub. When the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> rising was crushed by Tso Tsung-tang (1877-78), China claimed the territory occupied temporarily by <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. A special Chinese mission with Ch'ung-hou as chief was sent to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and concluded a treaty at Livadia (Oct., 1879). The contested territory was ceded, together with the Muzart Pass, to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and great inland commercial facilities were also granted to Muscovite merchants. Ch'ung-hou was denounced by the censor, Chang Chi-tung, and sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>; his treaty came to nought. It was a <em>casus belli</em>, but the intervention of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> prevented the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Tseng Kai-tze, the Chinese minister in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, was sent to St. Petersburg, where he signed a treaty restoring to China the greater part of the Ili and the Muzart Pass (12-24 Feb., 1881).

<p>The third difficulty arose through the occupation of Tong-king by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. China interfered, as the suzerain power of Annam. A treaty was signed at T'ien-tsin by Commodore Fournier (11 May, 1884), but was soon followed by the Bac-l&eacute; affair (23 June, 1884), and hostilities were resumed. Admiral Courbet bombarded the Fu-chou arsenal (23 Aug., 1884); Ki-lung in northern Formosa was captured (1 Oct., 1884); the Pescadores were taken (29 March, 1885); finally the Billot-Campbell peace protocol, signed in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (4 April, 1885), was followed by a treaty signed at T'ien-tsin (9 June, 1885) by Paten&ocirc;tre, minister, a commercial convention (T'ien-tsin, 25 April, 1886) by Cogoirdan, minister, and an additional convention (26 June, 1887), under Constans, minister. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> retained possession of Tong-king.

<p>Emperor Kwang Siu came of age 7 Feb., 1887, and took control of the government, 4 March, 1889. On 26 Feb., 1889, he married Ye-ho-na-la-shi, daughter of Kwei-siang. The imperial audience took place 5 March, 1891. For a long time, matters had gone from bad to worse between China and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, Korea being the coveted prey of both nations. The <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the Korean Kim-ok Kyum, a friend of the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, by his countryman, Hung Tjung-wu, at Shang-hai (28 March, 1894), and the attack made on the steamship, Kow-shin by the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> at the mouth of the Ya-lu River (25 July, 1894) were the starting points of a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The principal events during the course of this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> were: the battle of Sei-kwan (29 July 1894); a declaration of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (1 Aug.); a convention between Korea and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> (26 Aug.); the battles of Ping-yang (16 Sept.), and the Ya-lu (17 Sept.); the capture of Port Arthur (21 Nov.) and Wei-hai-wei (30 Jan., 1895) by the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>; the occupation of New-chwang by the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> (6 March); the landing of the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> at Formosa. The negotiations between Li Hung-chang, who had been wounded by a fanatic <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, and Ito and Mutsu, resulted in the signing of the treaty of Shimonoseki (17 April, 1895). The principle articles of this treaty were the cession of Liao-tung, Formosa, and the Pescadores to the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, an indemnity of 200,000,000 Kuping taels to be paid by China, the opening to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> trade of Sha-shi or Kin-chow (Hu-pe), Chung-k'ing, Su-chou, and Hang-chou, etc. On the interference of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Liao-tung was retroceded to China by the convention of 8 Nov., 1905. Korea fell entirely into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>. Ostensibly to obtain satisfaction for the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of two missionaries, the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> seized Kiao-chou Bay (Shan-tung) (14 Nov., 1897), which was granted to them on long lease (6 March, 1898). Following the example of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> obtained a similar lease of Ta-lien-wa and the adjacent waters (27 March 1898); <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Wei-hai-wei (2 April, 1898); <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Kwang-chou-wan (27 May, 1898). On 9 June the territory of Kow-loon ceded to Great Britain was extended to include Deep Bay and Mir's Bay; moreover, various declarations stipulated the non-alienation by China of the Yang-tze valley (11 Feb., 1898) and Fu-kien (April, 1898). Prince Kung died, 29 May 1898.

<p>From 10 June, 1898, until 20 Sept., 1898, when a <em>coup d'&eacute;tat</em> of Empress Tze-hi deprived Emperor Kwang Siu of all his power, he made a strong attempt to reform the administration of his empire with the assistance of K'ang Yu-wei and others. There followed a terrible reaction, which culminated in the Boxer rebellion. This began in Shang-tung and extended to Chi-li, secretly fostered by the empress dowager and her camarilla, Prince Twan, and General Tung Fu-siang. Everywhere missionaries were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>. The German minister, <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Von Ketteler</a>, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> (20 June); the legations at Peking were besieged by troops and the infuriated mob. A relief column, under the command of the English admiral, Sir Edward Seymore, failed to reach the capital. Finally a strong international army entered Peking (14 August, 1900), relieving the legations and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (Pe-tang), while the emperor, the empress dowager, and the court fled top Si-ngan-fu (Shen-si). Peking was looted and left in ruins.

<p>The negotiations were long and involved, and on their completion a protocol was signed at Peking, 7 Sept., 1901, by the representatives of the ten foreign powers. The principal clauses included: a mission of expiation to Berlin and an expiatory monument to <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Baron von Ketteler</a> on the spot where he was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>; the rehabilitation of officials executed for being favorable to foreigners; the suspension of official examinations for five years in all cities where foreigners had been massacred or mistreated; missions of reparation to <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> for the assassination of Sugiyama of the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> legation; expiatory monuments in cemeteries where foreign <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> had been <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a>; prohibition of the importation of arms; a total indemnity of 450,000,000 Haikwan taels (about $360,000,000); special quarters for the legations at Peking; the destruction of the forts at Taku; the reorganization of the foreign offices. An imperial edict of 24 July, 1901, transformed the Tsung-li Yamen into a Ministry of Foreign affairs (Wai-wu Pu), which takes precedence over the other ministries of State. Treaties were signed at Shang-hai by China with Great Britain (5 Sept., 1902), with <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> (commercial, 8 Oct., 1903), and with the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> for the extension of commercial relations (8 Oct., 1903).

<p>The great victories gained by <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> over <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and the signing of the treaty of <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a> (23 Aug., 5 Sept., 1905), the various agreements signed by the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> nations with the victorious power, the tremendous effects produced on all <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> peoples by the triumph of one of them, the latent discontent in China, the delusive and superficial attempts at reform in the Middle kingdom, leave to the future prospects which are anything but encouraging to the Western counties.
<h2>Customs</h2>

<p>The imperial maritime customs were started in Shanghai in 1854 when, threatened by rebels, the collection of dues on foreign trade became impossible. Representatives of the three consuls from Great Britain, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, were placed in charge of the custom service, which was inaugurated 12 July, 1854. The American and French delegates having retired in the course of years, the British delegate, Horatio N. lay, remained in charge until he was superseded in Nov., 1863, as inspector general, by Robert Hart (b. 20 Feb., 1835, at Portsdown, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>). The Shanghai system was extended to Canton (Oct., 1859) and afterwards to the other treaty ports. The importance of the service has grown with years and now includes also the postal service. It is divided into four departments: (1) revenue department (Indoor, Outdoor, and Coast staff), with 957 foreigners of various nationalities, the majority being British, and 4138 Chinese (1903); (2) marine department; (3) <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> department; (4) postal department. An imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 9 May, 1905, placed at the head of the custom service two high mandarins.

<p>At the end of 1906, 2096 localities were opened to postal business, and in 1907 the number of articles dealt with increased to nearly 113 millions. The number of parcels reached 1,383,000, and money transactions taels 1,539,000. Moreover, there are some foreign (British, German, French, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, American, Russian) postal agencies at some of the treaty ports. On 6 Nov., 1906, a new Chinese ministry was created, styled the Yu-ch'wan Pu (Board of Posts and Communications) with a president and two vice-presidents.
<h2>Telegraph system</h2>

<p>In 1905 the Imperial Company had 375 stations throughout China, <a href="../cathen/09585a.htm">Manchuria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>. Other companies are the Imperial German Telegraph Co., through Shanghai, Tsing-tao, and Che-fu; the French Telegraph Co., from Amoy to Tourane; the Great Northern Telegraph Co., through Shanghai, Gutzlaff, <a href="../cathen/10667c.htm">Nagasaki</a>, Vladivostok, Amoy, and Hong-Kong; the Eastern Extension, Australasia and China Telegraph Co., connecting Shanghai, Gutzlaff, Fu-chou, Hong-Kong, <a href="../cathen/07765a.htm">Indo-China</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>; the Deutsch-Niederl&egrave;ndische Telegraphengesellschaft, three cables connecting Yap (Carolines) and Shanghai, Menado (Celebes), and Guam (Mariannes); the Commercial Pacific Cable Co., connecting San Francisco, Honolulu, Midway, Guam, <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, and Shanghai with a branch line between Guam and Yokohama; the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> Telegraph Co., connecting Sharp Peak (Fu-chou), Formosa, Ishigakishima, Naha, Oshima, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, and Korea.

<h2>Weights and measures</h2>

<p>Measures of length: one foot (chih), 14 5/8 inches = 10 tsun; 1 tsun = 10 fen; 10 feet = 1 chang; 10 chang = 1 yu. One li = 360 kung or 867 yards. The land measures are the mao (mow) = 240 pu or 26.73 sq. ft; 100 mao = one k'ing of 16.7 acres, The t'ou = 10 cheng or 2.269 gallons. Measures of weight: The tan or picul = 100 kin or catties = 133 1/3 lbs; 1 kin (pound or catty) = 16 taels or 1 1/3 lb; 1 tael (ounce of liang) = 24 chou or 1 1/3 oz.; 1 liang = 10 tsien; 1 tsien = 10 fen; 1 fen = 10 li. Money: 1 tael or liang = 10 tsien (mace); 1 mace = 10 fen (candareen); 1 candareen = 10 li or cash (in French <em>sap&egrave;que</em>). The tael is a weight of silver which varies considerably in value; in 1906 the Haikwan tael, in which the custom revenues and all values are given, was equivalent to 2.46 Indian rupees, 1.60 <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> yen, Mexican $1.54, English 3s 3 1/2d., U.S. $0.80. Chinese lump silver, called <em>sycee</em> (fine silk), is made into ingots resembling in shape a shoe. The silver experts are called <em>shroff</em>.
<h2>Calendar</h2>

<p>The common year has twelve lunar months. In a period of 19 years, there are seven intercalary years, each of 13 months. Years are reckoned either from the beginning of the reign of the emperor, or from their place in the cycle of 60 years. The sexagenary cycle was devised by Ta-nao, minister of Hwang-ti, the sixty-first year of whose reign (2637 B.C.) was taken for the first cyclical sign. A common civil year consists of from 383 to 385 days. since the time of Emperor K'ang-hi the day is divided into 96 <em>k'o</em>, or quarters, sub-divided into 15 <em>fen</em>, or minutes, the minute into 60 <em>miao</em>, or seconds, each second into 60 <em>wei</em>; these in turn are divided into 12 <em>shih</em>, subdivided into two <em>siao-shi</em> (<em>ch'u</em> and <em>cheng</em>).
<h2>Social life</h2>

<p>The family name of a Chinaman is <em>sing</em>. China is called <em>Pe-kia-sing</em>, the "hundred <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>". The prenomen is <em>ming-tze</em>; the <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">Christian name</a> is <em>sheng-ming</em>; the name given to children by <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> <em>nai-ming</em>; the official name <em>kwan-ming</em>. An emperor, besides his personal name, has a title as ruler <em>nien-hao</em>, and a dynastic title or posthumous name <em>miao-hao</em>; some of the emperors have has several <em>nien-hao</em>. Thus <em>Hiuan-yi</em> was the personal name of the emperor, whose <em>nien-ho</em> (period) was K'ang-hi, and his <em>miao-hao</em> was Sheng Tsu.

<p>The marriage ceremonies include the visit to the prospective bride's father and brother by an intermediary (<em>mei-jin</em>) sent by the prospective bridegroom's father and brother to inquire her name, which is to be examined by the horoscope; if the horoscope be auspicious, the <em>mei-jin</em> is sent to make an offer of marriage which, if accepted, is confirmed in writing; presents are sent to the parent of the bride; a lucky day is selected for the wedding, and the bridegroom sends some of his friends to bring the bride to his house. The seven valid grounds for <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> are: talkativeness, wantonness, theft, barrenness, disobedience to a husband's <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, jealousy, and inveterate infirmity; to these infidelity has been added.

<p>The burial ceremonies are more or less varied, short or long according to the wealth of the deceased, and the dead are buried in graves. The graves of the Ming emperors at Nan-king and in <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a> are famous. The emperors of the present dynasty are buried in Chi-li in mausoleums called <em>Tung-li</em> and <em>Si-ling</em>; their ancestors rest at Mukden. The period of mourning for a father is three years, which is reduced in practice to twenty-seven months. White is the mourning colour of China; it is blue for the emperor, and the seals are inked in blue instead of vermilion.

<p>The main food is rice (<em>fan</em>), and as it does not grow in Northern China, great quantities are transported to the southern provinces and Cochin-China. Among the Chinese delicacies are birds' nests (<em>Yen-wo</em>), nests of the collocalia brevirostris, which are made with seaweed (<em>gelidium</em>); dried shark's fins, black or white (<em>pe-yu-chi or he-yu-chi</em>); b&eacute;che-de-mer (<em>Hai-san</em>); preserved eggs (<em>pi-tan, sung-hwa-tan</em>). The Chinese use a great deal of oil (<em>hiang-yu</em>) extracted from the <em>seamum orientale</em>, the <em>Arachis Hypogoea</em>, or the <em>Brassica sinensis</em>. The Chinese drink tea (<em>cha</em>) and fermented liquors (<em>sam-shoo</em> and others). They eat with small wooden or <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> sticks, called chop-sticks (<em>kwai-tze</em>); they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the use of the fork (<em>cha-tze</em>), the spoon (<em>piao-keng</em>), and the knife (<em>tao</em>).
<h2>Festivals</h2>

<p>The first day of the first moon (<em>Yuan-tan</em>) or New Year's Day, is the occasion of great festivity. houses are decorated with paper flowers and small strips of guilt and red paper; <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> are paid and accounts are settled. The first full moon of the year is the Feast of Lanterns (<em>Shang-yuan-tsieh</em>), when lanterns of various forms, colours, and materials are suspended before each door. The fifth day of the fifth month is the Feats of the Dragon's Boats (<em>T'ien-chung-sieh</em>), instituted in the memory of the statesman K'iu Yuan, who drowned himself in the river Mi-lo, an affluent of the Tung-ting lake, in the fourth century B.C. Other festivals are those of the village gods (<em>T'u-ti-tan</em>), of the god of literature (<em>Wen-ch'ang-tan</em>), of Sakyamuni, Kwan-yn, <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a>, etc.

<p>On 9 Oct., 1907, an imperial edict was issued in Peking, ordering the Board of Revenues and Commerce forthwith to introduce a uniform system of weights and measures throughout the Chinese Empire, the standards to be fixed within six months.
