<h1>Choir</h1>  

<p>There is much ambiguity about the terms <em>choir</em> and <em>presbytery.</em> Strictly speaking, the choir is that part of the church where the stalls of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are. The term is often loosely used for the whole of the eastern arm, including the choir proper, sanctuary, retro-choir, etc. At <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a> the stalls are in the east <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and therefore no part of the choir is in the eastern arm. At Canterbury the stalls are in the eastern arm and the choir occupies its western bays, i.e. the space between the crossing and the sanctuary. In non-collegiate churches the eastern arm is called the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a>, the eastern portion of which is the presbytery or sanctuary. In the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches, e.g. Santa Maria Maggiore at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, there were but two parts, a <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and sanctuary; there was no <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> choir. The sanctuary occupied the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> was joined immediately to the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, or, in the double-aisled <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of the fourth century, such as those of St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>; there was no interposition of a choir between <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>. The choir was simply the east part of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, and was fenced off by low walls, usually of marble, carved or perforated with interlacing patterns &#151; peacocks (the symbol of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>), lions, doves, etc. These walls were called <em>cancelli</em>, hence the English word "chancel". The word <em>choir</em> is first used by writers of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore of Seville</a> and <a href="../cathen/07461a.htm">Honorius of Autun</a> derive it from the <em>corona</em> or circle of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or singers who surrounded the altar. The choir proper did not exist until the time of Constantine, when the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were able to develop the services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The introduction of the choir, or enclosed space in the centre of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, attached to the bema or presbytery, as the raised space came to be called, was the last great change of plan. Round three sides of this choir the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were allowed to congregate to hear the Gospels or Epistles read from the two <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a> or ambones, where were built into its enclosure, one on either side; or to hear the services which were read or sung by the inferior order of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who occupied its precincts. The enclosure of the choir was kept low, so as not to hide the view of the raised presbytery. In the south- western districts of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and throughout <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, also in St. John Lateran, St. Clement, St. Laurence Without-the-walls, and St. Mary Major in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the choir occupies the centre of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> with an enclosed passage to the sanctuary. In parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the choir still retains its ancient position behind or eastward of the altar. In the Duomo of <a href="../cathen/06070a.htm">Fiesole</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, there are two choirs, one behind and the other in front of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>. In the north of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> choirs are usually elevated upon <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypts</a> (that of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> stands over the <em>confessio</em>) and shut in with solid stone screens; the same arrangement exists at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a>, <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, Bourages, St-Denis, <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and Notre-Dame in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The finest existing enclosures are those of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>.
