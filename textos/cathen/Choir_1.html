<h1>Choir</h1>  

<p>A body of singers entrusted with the musical parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> service, and organized and instructed for that purpose. The Talmud witnesses to the careful organization of the Temple choir, and as the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> worshipped with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, we find them from the first using the psalmodic solo with congregational refrain, and from the fourth century psalmody in alternating chorus, both possibly based on Jewish practice. Thus early, and all through the <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plain-chant</a> period, the choir seems to have been influenced by the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> division of the music into solo and chorus chants. Soon after Constantine's conversion we hear of <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>-schools in which, as boys, many of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had received their raining. But perhaps the most famous song-school of history was the Roman <em>schola cantorum</em> of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, described by <a href="../cathen/08491a.htm">John the Deacon</a>, called also <em>orphanotrophium</em>, as its singing boys came chiefly from <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>. Many of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the seventh century were connected with or came from it. Following this we have the establishment of many other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, of which the most famous were those of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and St. Gall, in the eighth century. The current system of oral instruction rendered such <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. About the year 1100, after the introduction of the musical staff, they began to decline in importance. So thoroughly was music practised in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> song-schools connected with churches or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, founded for the purpose of setting forth the liturgy with the utmost splendour and beauty, that until the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> the history of music is practically the history of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>. Yet even about the fourteenth century the gradual substitution of <em>musica mensurata</em> for the <em>cantilena romana</em>, part-music for unisonous, wrought an increasing change in the relation of choir to altar. This change was marked when <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Pope Gregory XI</a>, in 1377, returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where the new music had flourished, and amalgamated his choir with the <em>schola cantorum</em>, reorganizing it under the title <em>Collegio dei Capellani Pontificia</em> and placing it under a <em>Maestro della Capella Pontificio</em>. The choir now became more laicised and self-contained. It had grown out of, and had been shaped by <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> needs. Its place was in the sanctuary, its members were <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> or boys brought up under <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> direction in a house attached to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Now it might occupy a gallery and be ruled by a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of composition associated with this change was largely built upon <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plain-chant</a>, and produced such masters of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">religious music</a> as <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a>, Vittoria, and <a href="../cathen/03092f.htm">Byrd</a>. Later, the introduction of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> voices, the toleration of mixed choirs, and the secularization in style of the music sung, brought about a still greater departure from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and influence of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> <em>schola cantorum.</em> During the present <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> revival, however, boys who have been actively employed in <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> for so many centuries (we find them mentioned indeed as early as the fourth century) are gradually taking their old place in the constitution and functions of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> choir.
