<p>DIOCESE OF CHRISTCHURCH (CHRISTOPOLITANA)

<p>(Its centre being Christchurch, the Capital of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, New Zealand.) It comprises the provinces of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and Westland, a small portion of the Province of Nelson, and the Chatham Islands. In July, 1840, the French corvette l'Aube started for Akaroa (Canterbury) to land a body of settlers there, and to annex to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the South Island of New Zealand. The former project was accomplished; the latter was frustrated by lieutenant-governor Hobson. Having ascertained the destination and purpose of the expedition, he raced the corvette to Akaroa in the warship Britomart and, four days before the arrival of the French settler, proclaimed the south Island British territory. The first English colonists (the "Canterbury Pilgrims") landed at Lyttelton 16 December, 1850. They, and many that followed them, were sent out by the Canterbury Association, a High Church organization whose colonizing scheme was described by Low <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> as a "Puseyite invasion of <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a>". The Canterbury concessions (nearly 3,000,000 fertile acres) were intended to be and remain a great <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> monopoly. This, however, was prevented by the Constitution Act of 1852. In all Canterbury, including Akaroa, there were 136 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in 1851. During the first two decades they were ministered to by the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a> Comte, Pesant, Tripe, S&eacute;on, Petitjean, and others. In 1860 Christchurch received its first resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Father Chataignier, S.M. On 11 September of that year he laid the foundations of the first church in <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, a wooden structure, 28 by 18 ft. A more spacious church was erected in 1864. Enlarged and beautified by Father Ginary, S. M., this subsequently served as a pro-cathedral from 1887 till 1905. On the discovery of gold in 1864 there was a great influx of people to Westland, which led to the formation of missions in Hokitika, Greymouth, and elsewhere on the West coast. The Diocese of Christchurch, formerly part of the <a href="../cathen/15580a.htm">Diocese of Wellington</a>, was established by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a>, 10 May, 1887. On his arrival in Christchurch there were in the diocese 35 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 16 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and 17 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (8 secular and 9 <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>). The history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> since then is one of closer organization and steady progress. The Marist Brothers and the Sisters of Nazareth were introduced; new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> districts formed; 30 churches built or enlarged; 15 presbyteries, 9 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 10 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (Marist Brothers) erected; and a white stone <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, one of the most beautiful <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">religious edifices</a> in Australasia, was opened 12 February, 1905.
<h2>Statistics (August 1907)</h2>

<p>Parochial districts, 21; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> 38 (20 <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, 18 seculars); Marist Brothers, 13; <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 150; <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, 17; Marist Brothers' <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, 3; boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (girls), 6; primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 30; <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, 2 (Nazareth Home and a great <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">Magdalen</a> Asylum); <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, about 25,000.
