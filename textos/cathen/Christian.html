<h1>Christian</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, d. 1245. Before becoming a missionary he was a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/11242b.htm">Oliva</a> near Danzig or, as appears more probable, at Lekno or some other Polish <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In 1209 he was commissioned by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> to direct the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> missions between the Rivers Vistula and Memel, which had been begun by Abbot Godfrey of Lekno, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Philip in 1207. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1212, and, when, in 1215, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in order to report to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on the condition and prospects of his mission, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. On his journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was accompanied by two converted <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> noblemen, Warpoda and Suavabona, who were then solemnly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. Soon after Christian's return to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> rose against the foreign <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had settled there, destroyed their fortifications, and compelled many of the newly converted to return to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. With the permission of Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, Christian gathered an army of <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> who, however, were too few to gain a decisive victory. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was even forced to leave <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. In a contract made with Duke Conrad of Masovia and Bishop Gedeon of <a href="../cathen/12166b.htm">Plock</a>, in 1222, Christian received rich possessions and incomes as well as episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in Culmerland. He, therefore, decided to erect his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at <a href="../cathen/04566a.htm">Culm</a>, and from there direct the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> missions. But soon the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> invaded Culmerland also. In his extremity Christian founded the Order of the Knights of Dobrin, which was approved by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a> about 1228. When these <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> were unsuccessful Christian and Duke Conrad of Masovia applied for assistance to Herman of Salza, the Grand Master of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> in Palestine. In 1228 Conrad entered into a contacts with the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, by virtue of which his possessions in Culmerland became the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the order. In 1230 Bishop Christian added to this grant all his own possessions in Culmerland and, a year later, one-third of his possessions in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, retaining, however, for himself <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> both in Culmerland and in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>.

<p>Under the leadership of Herman Balk the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> began the great conflict which after more than half a century of bloodshed dealt the death-blow to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and made the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> one of the greatest powers in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. When Christian asked for the assistance of the German Knights he was determined to keep the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> under his control. Soon, however, he became aware that the order laid claim to the spiritual as well as the temporal management of the conquered territory. Up to the year 1227 none but <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> assisted Christian in his apostolic labours; but with the arrival of the German Knights, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who were favoured by the order and by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a>, took a strong foothold in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, while Christian and his <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> colabourers were thrown into the background. William of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, who had been appointed <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, disregarded the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Christian and proceeded as it there were no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. In addition to these misfortunes, Christian was captured and his attendants slain by some <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> who pretended to have been converted and to desire the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. During the six years of his captivity (1233-39) the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> did nothing for his release. In 1236 <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, who, it appears, considered the liberation of Christian impossible, empowered William of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> to divide <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> into three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for these new sees were, in accordance with the wish of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, to be selected from the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, while no provision whatever was made for the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> Bishop Christian.

<p>Finally, in the winter of 1239-40, Christian obtained his liberty. He was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give hostages whom he afterwards ransomed for a sum stated as eight hundred marks (at that time a large amount), which was granted him by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory</a>. Immediately upon his liberation Christian complained to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> refused <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> who desired it, oppressed the newly converted, claimed episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and refused to restore <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> which belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The first two accusations may have been wrong or exaggerated but the last two were founded on <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In 1240 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> instructed Bishop Henry and two provosts of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> to induce the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> to satisfy the demands of Christian. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate's</a> intended division of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> into three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> did not take effect, and after <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory's</a> death (22 Aug., 1241) Christian and the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> agreed that two thirds of the conquered territory in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> should belong to the Order, and one-third to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; that, moreover, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to exercise in the territory belonging to the order those <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions which only a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can perform.

<p>William of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, did not give up his plans of dividing <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> into various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. He finally obtained from <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Pope Innocent IV</a> permission to make a division, and on 29 July, 1243, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> was divided into the four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: Culm, <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, <a href="../cathen/05522a.htm">Ermland</a>, and Samland. The only recognition which Christian received for his apostolic labours of more than twenty years consisted in the privilege to select for himself any one of the four new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>. When Christian refused to make a selection he was severely reprimanded by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Despite numerous petitions sent by <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> in favour of Bishop Christian, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 6 Feb., 1245, threatened to deprive him of all episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> unless he selected one of the new <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> within two months. In the spring of the same year, probably before the two months had passed, Christian died.
