<h1>Christian Athens</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was first preached in Athens by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. He came to Athens from Ber&oelig;a of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, coming probably by water and landing in the Peir&aelig;evs, the harbour of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. This was about the year 53. Having arrived at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, he at once sent for Silas and Timotheos who had remained behind in Ber&oelig;a. While awaiting the coming of these he tarried in Athens, viewing the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> city, and frequenting the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>; for there were already <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in Athens. He also frequented the <em>agora</em>, and there met and conversed with the men of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, telling them of the new <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which he was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a>. Finally, at the Areopagos, he spoke to them the sermon which is preserved in the seventeenth chapter of the Acts. The Athenians did not enthusiastically accept this first preaching of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The Acts mention, however, that a few believed in Paul's teaching. Amongst these were Dionysios, a member of the Areopagite court, and Damaris, or Thamar possibly, who may have been a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewess</a>. A tradition asserts that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> wrote from <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> his two letters to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Thessalonika. Even if this be so, his stay in Athens was not a protracted one. He departed by sea, and went to Korinth by way of Kenchre&aelig;, its eastern harbour. It seems that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community was rapidly formed, although for a considerable time it did not possess a numerous membership. The commoner tradition names the Areopagite as the first head and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Athenians. Another tradition, however, gives this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to Hierotheos the Thesmothete. The successors of the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> were not all Athenians by lineage. They are catalogued as Narkissos, Publius, and Quadratus. Narkissos is stated to have come from Palestine, and Publius from <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>. In some lists Narkissos is omitted. Quadratus is revered for having contributed to early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature by writing an apology, which he addressed to the <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a>. This was on the occasion of Hadrian's visit to Athens. Another Athenian who defended <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in writing at a somewhat later time was Aristeides. His apology was directed to the <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Emperor Marcus Aurelius</a>. <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a> also wrote an apology. In the second century there must have been a considerable community of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Athens, for Hygeinos, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, is said to have written a letter to the community in the year 139. It is probable that the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> did not have many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, although Dionysios himself <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> list. Under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>, we find recorded in the catalogue of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> the names of Herakleios, Benedimos, Pavlinos, and Leonides with his followers, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> Charissa, and her companions. One reason why the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were few is that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were also few. Besides, the spirit of the Athenian <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> was not one of blood; and it is probable that the persecutions in Athens were rather of the social and scholastic kind. This would account for the writings of the apologists who thus would defend themselves by weapons similar to those which their opponents used. The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the Athenian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> did not indeed admire <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, as they understood it; nevertheless there is some ground for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that amongst the teachers who occupied the official and historic chairs of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> there later was at least one who was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, Proh&aelig;resios, the <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">sophist</a>. Be this as it may, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> was not rudely anti-Christian. Otherwise the presence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> amongst the students could not be understood. <a href="../cathen/14031c.htm">Sixtus II</a>, or Xystos, who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 258, also may have studied in Athens and is called "the son of an Athenian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>". But the most noted men who frequented the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> here were Basil from K&aelig;sareia, and <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory from Nazianzos</a>, about the middle of the fourth century. These <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> kept <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> alive for four centuries, but by the fifth century the ancient religion of Elevsis and Athens had practically succumbed. In the Council of Nik&aelig;a there was present a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. In 529 the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> were closed. From that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had no rival in Athens.

<p>Down to the time of Constantine, and later, there were no large <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> in Athens. Like the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> towns were small and unpretentious, the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> did not erect sumptuous <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>. With their worship they did not associate splendour of temple and sanctuary as indispensable. In the time of Basil and <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory</a>, there were surely numerous church edifices in Athens, but they were not spacious <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>. They are called <em>hieroi oikoi</em>, and probably were not much larger than the ordinary dwelling-houses of the inhabitants. The first magnificent churches in Athens were, therefore, the Greek <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> which, after the disappearance of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, were transferred to the use of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rites. It must have been about Justinian's time when the most of the ancient <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> were converted into churches. Churches or ruins of churches have been frequently found on the sites where <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> shrines or <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> originally stood. This is in part due to the fact that the sites were first sanctified for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition by these <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> or sanctuaries being made into churches. It is also to some extent <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that sometimes the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> whose aid was to be invoked at the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> shrine bore some outward analogy to the deity previously hallowed in that place. Thus in Athens the shrine of the healer Asklepios, situated between the two theatres on the south side of the Akropolis, when it became a church, was made sacred to the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Athenians invoked as <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> healers, Kosmas and Damian. Amongst the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> converted into churches were the Parthenon and the Erechtheion on the Akropolis, and the yet well-preserved Heph&aelig;steion (or "temple of Theseus", as it is incorrectly called) near the ancient <em>agora</em>. The Heph&aelig;steion was, in later times, sacred to <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a>. Pittakis, a noted epigraphist of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> in the early half of the last century, published an inscription which purports to state that in the year 630 the Parthenon was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> under the title of "the church of Divine Wisdom" (<em>tes Hagias Sophias</em>). But Pittakis was very careless or credulous at times in the copying of inscriptions. So we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> what was the original title of this church. Possibly, from its first conversion the Parthenon had been dedicated to the Panagia. At least we learn from <a href="../cathen/01239b.htm">Michael Akominatos</a> that in the twelfth century it was sacred to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>. On the columns of this church, and on its marble walls, especially around the doors, are numerous <em>graffiti</em> inscriptions which record various events, many of them important for sacred and profane history, such as the names and deaths of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and public calamities. In these <em>graffiti</em> inscriptions, this church is called "the great church", "the church of Athens", and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, or <em>katholike ekklesia</em>. All these appellations show that it was the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church of the city. In Greek usage, the name <em>katholikon</em> or <em>katholike ekklesia</em>, was a title applied to churches which were the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>.



<p>That the Parthenon was a church as far back as the sixth century is proven by the cemetery which lay along its south side. This region was filled with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> graves, in some of which were found <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of a date as early as the reign of Justinian. In order to fit the Parthenon for a church, changes had to be made in it; an <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> was built at the east end, and a great entrance door was placed in the west end. The interior walls were covered with fresco <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. After the conversion of these Greek <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> into churches, perhaps two or three centuries elapsed before the Athenians found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to lavishly add to the number of large church edifices by erecting many new ones. Then they followed the styles of ecclesiastical architecture which had been developed elsewhere, and had become prevalent throughout so much of the empire. From about the end of the eighth century they erected new churches more frequently. Perhaps the Empress Eirene, who was an Athenian, gave some impulse to this tendency. As years went on, Athens and the surrounding villages of Attika, and the fields were filled with churches, many of them veritable gems of Byzantine comeliness. The churches which were built in Athens and vicinity during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> numbered hundreds. Likewise many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded, both in Athens itself and in the country of Attika, especially on the slopes of the surrounding mountains of Hymettos, and Pentelikos, and Parnes. A complete list of the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> could not be made. But as time goes on, and seals and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and inscriptions are deciphered, the list of names will grow. Pistos, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, was present at the Council of Nik&aelig;a in 325. Bishop Modestus was at the Council of Ephesos in 431. John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, was amongst the Fathers who signed the Acts of the Sixth &OElig;cumenical Council. He was present as "Leggate of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>". From the <em>graffiti</em> on the Parthenon a number of other names and dates are already known. In these <em>graffiti</em> we read names of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> prior to the exaltation of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> to the rank of an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, then the names of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and finally those of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>. The time of the elevation of this see to an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> cannot yet be fixed. Gregory II, who was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the Athenians during the first <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Photios, bore the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. But it is not known whether or not he was the first who had that title. This was about 857-867. Shortly afterwards the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> received the higher title of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. Niketas who took part in the Eighth &OElig;cumenical Council under Basil the Makedonian, which closed 28 February, 870, and who signed the acts of that council as "Niketas by the grace of God, Metropolitan of Athens", on his seals, or leaden bulls, simply places the inscription "Niketas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>". Amongst the signatures to the acts of this council, that of Niketas stands twenty-second in order. But in a full assembly of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> he would not rank so high. According to the list made by Emperor Leon the Wise (886-911), a list intended to show the relative rank of each ecclesiastical dignitary under the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> is relegated to the twenty-eighth place. Just what sees were under the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> prior to Photios is not easy to discover. After the changes brought about by Photios and his successors, the sees that were suffragan to Athens varied in number from time to time. But in general it may be stated that all of Attika belonged directly to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, after the abolishing of the See of Marathon, about the middle of the ninth century. And under Athens were, besides other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, the Sees of Evripos, Oreos, Karystos, and Porthmos in Evb&oelig;a; Avlon; Diavleia in Phokis, and Koroneia in B&oelig;otia; Andros, Skyros, Syros, and Seriphos of the islands; and, later, Keos and &AElig;gina.

<p>From Photios down to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> the Metropolitans of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> were all of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek rite</a>, naturally. Likewise their sympathies were rather with Constantinople than with older <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church continued to be the ancient Parthenon. It seems that the residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was on the Akropolis, in the great Portals, or Propyl&aelig;a, and that in these Propyl&aelig;a they had a private episcopal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. In these days <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was not held in very general esteem in Athens. No special erudition characterized the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Even the inscriptions which decorated the seals and bulls of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were often most childishly misspelled. From the time of Photios to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> the most noted ecclesiastic was probably the last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/01239b.htm">Michael Akominatos</a>. He, however, was Athenian neither by birth nor by <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He came to Athens expecting great things in the city of ancient wisdom, but was disappointed. Still it is wrong to say that <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> produced no scholars and noted personages. Athena&iuml;s, who became queen to Theodosios in 421, and Eirene, who became empress in 780, were Athenians. From the sixth to the thirteenth century Athens was out and out a provincial town, exercising no influence on the world at large, and almost unheard of in the politics of the day. Nevertheless, the Emperor Konstas on his way to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> in 662 spent the winter in Athens; and after his victories over the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> in 1018, Basil II visited this city to celebrate his triumphs. When, under Constantine, the Empire was divided into governmental <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the close relations which then were created between <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">the Church and the State</a> caused the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> divisions to be often identical with the civil. By this system all of <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, wherein was Athens, was included within the Diocese of Eastern <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>, of which Thessalonika was the capital. All of this Diocese of Eastern <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> was under the direct <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>. And so it remained until the reign of Leo the Isavrian. This emperor, incensed at <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Pope Gregory III</a>, because of his strong opposition to Leo's <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclastic</a> passion, retorted against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by transferring these countries of the Illyrian diocese from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> to that of the See of Constantinople. This occurred in the year 732. In this great struggle between the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclasts</a> and the adherents to the use of the icons, the Athenians placed themselves on the side of iconolatry. While accepting without any recorded protest their transference to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Eastern patriarch, they retained the images in their churches and continued to venerate them. All the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> north of the Korinthiac Gulf, who then were called Helladikoi, or Helladians, were opposed to the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclasts</a>. And their opposition was so determined that they fitted out an expedition and manned a fleet, intending to attack Constantinople, depose Leo, and place their leader, Kosmas, on the throne. In this expedition, in which the Athenians doubtlessly had an important part, assistance was given by the inhabitants of the Kyklad islands, who probably furnished most of the ships. The attempt, however, was futile. The fleet was easily destroyed by the imperial ships in April, 727. The mutual bitterness which was evinced in Constantinople by the contending parties of Photians and Anti-Photians was reflected here in Athens. Gregory II was <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> when Ignatios was restored to his throne as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. Ignatios deposed him as being an adherent of Photios. His successor, Kosmas, was also later deposed. Then Niketas, a Byzantine, came to Athens as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> with the title of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. This Niketas was a supporter of Ignatios. His successor, Anastasios, was a follower of Photios. Sabbas, who succeeded Anastasios, was likewise a <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photian</a> and was one of those who signed the acts of the synod which closed in May, 880, by which Photios was again recognized as patriarch. A bull of his still exists, whereon he designates himself as "Metropolitan of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>".

<p>Throughout the East there was a peculiar type of <em>Panagia-icon</em>, copies of which might be seen in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and churches in many places. This was the <em>Panagia Gorgoepekoos</em>. This <em>Panagia Gorgoepekoos</em> seems to have been originally an Athenian icon, and was probably identical with an icon which was called the <em>Panagia Athen&oelig;otissa</em>. The <em>Athen&oelig;otissa</em> was the Madonna of the church in the Parthenon. This icon is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/01239b.htm">Michael Akominatos</a>.

<p>After the conquest of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section4">Fourth Crusade</a>, in the partitionment which followed, Athens and the rest of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> were given to Boniface, King of Thessalonika. Boniface gave Athens to one of his followers, Otho de ha Roche. At their coming to Athens the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> found it small and insignificant. They chose Thebes to be the seat of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> rather than Athens. Thebes was a more important trade centre than was Athens. Athens, however, was considered important enough to be continued as an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>. It thus was ranked in equal dignity with the other larger cities of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, such as Thebes, within de la Roche's dominion, and Patr&aelig; and Korinth in the Morea. The conquest of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> was accomplished in 1204 and 1205. The first Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> introduced the Latin ritual into the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the Parthenon, in the year 1206. This was Archbishop Berard. Thus after a lapse of centuries from the time of Leo the Isavrian, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and Athens were again placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> rule the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> were without exception of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, and were of Western lineage. Likewise the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, in the Parthenon, were of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, and were <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. Their number was fixed by Cardinal Benedict, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in Thessalonika, by order of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>. But the ritual of the common <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was not disturbed. The people continued to enjoy their own rites, celebrated by Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the Greek language. These Greek <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had, however, at least outwardly, to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Amongst the sees which were suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> were those of Chalkis, Thermopyl&aelig; (or Bodonitsa) Davleia. Avlon, Zorkon, Karystos, Koroneia, Andros, Skyros, Kea, and Megara The last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> was the learned <a href="../cathen/01239b.htm">Michael Akominatos</a>, who, when the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> came, retired to the Island of Keos, after first visiting the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">cardinal legate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in Thessalonika to impetrate certain favours for those formerly under his charge who wished to adhere to the Greek form of worship. In Keos he lived as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. John the Baptist. To support the Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and the canons, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, a number of possessions were given to him. Amongst these was the monastic <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of K&aelig;sariane, and the island of Belbina, which <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> gave to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> in 1208. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> cavaliers lived in splendour in <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a> and <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. The dignitaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> lived in ease. Along with the coming of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> there came also Latin <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> established themselves near Athens in 1208 in the beautiful <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Daphne, which previously was in the possession of Greek <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Fathers. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were the most active <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order in Greece during this period. There were also <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>.

<p>In the year 1311 another great change came over Athens. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> were defeated by the Catalans in the swamps of the Kephisos in B&oelig;otia. Athens, with Thebes, became their possession. Under their sway, which lasted more than seventy-five years, the higher dignitaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> continued naturally to be Latins. In these days there were fourteen suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> under the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, and at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> there were eleven or twelve canons. In 1387 another change overtook Athens. The Catalonian possessions came under the ownership of the Acciajoli, Florentines who had risen to eminence as bankers. The Acciajoli retained possession of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> until driven out by Om&aelig;r Pasha, who in June of 1456 entered the city and, in 1458, took possession of the Akropolis for his Sultan, Mohammed II. The only notable change in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters under the Acciajoli was that they permitted two <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> to reside in Athens, a Greek dignitary for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, and a Latin for the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. In this way the defection of the Greeks of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> from Roman <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was again a fact. The Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> lived in the <em>Castro</em>, that is, on the Akropolis, and the Greek <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> had his residence in the lower city. Franco Acciajoli was the last Duke of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. The last Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was Nicholas Protimus. He died in 1483. After his death <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> continued to appoint titular Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">See of Athens</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> domination the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and all its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> again became Greek. All the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> were again filled by Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were again occupied by Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The Parthenon, however, was appropriated by the conquerors, who converted it into a mosque. The Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> continued to live in the lower town, and during the latter half of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> supremacy they usually resided near the church of the Panagia Gorgoepekoos, which they used as a private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. They lived elsewhere at times, however, for Father Babin mentions Archbishop Anthimos as living near the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Dionysios, which was at the foot of the Areopagos Hill. In <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> times, as previously, the sees under Athens were not always the same in number. Nor were they all identical with those that had been under the Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. Some of them were Koroneia, <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Salona</a>, Bodonitsa, Davleia, Evripos, Oreos, Karystos, Porthmos, Andros, <a href="../cathen/14395a.htm">Syra</a>, and Skyros.

<p>Amongst the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders that lived in Athens under <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> rule were the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. They were there as early as 1658. But they had already been in Greece under the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> are to be mentioned with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> as being the first Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> who sent students to Athens and other places in the East for the purpose of studying the language and literature of the Greeks. Another fact to the credit of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> is that, although not primarily interested in antiquities, they fruitfully contributed to the awakening of our interest in such studies. There appeared in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in the second half of the seventeenth century, a book by Guillet or "de la Guilleti&egrave;re", which is entirely based on information received from the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> sketched the first plan of modern Athens. Considering how suspicious the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were of any kind of description of their possessions and castles, it was quite a feat for the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> to have made so good a plan as they did. It was published by Guillet in his book, "Ath&egrave;nes, anciennes et nouvelles", 1675. In those days the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> had a comfortable <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Athens, which they built on ground bought from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1658, behind the choragic monument of Lysikrates. The monument itself served them as their little <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. in this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> many a traveller found hospitality. It was destroyed by fire in 1821, and the site is now owned by the French Government. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were also active in Athens. They came in 1645. It must be noted that it was Father Babin, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, who wrote the first careful account of the modern condition of the ruins of ancient Athens. This he did in a letter to the Abb&eacute; P&eacute;coil, canon of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. This letter was written 8 October, 1672. It was published with a commentary by Spon in 1674 under the title of "Relation de l'&eacute;tat pr&eacute;sent de la ville d'Ath&egrave;nes". The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> finally withdrew from <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, leaving the entire field to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> remained until the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the revolution. In the time of Babin and Spon there were about two hundred churches in Athens, all of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, except the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the western <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. With the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the insurrection, in 1821, ends the history of the older Church of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. A new Latin <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> has again its residence in Athens. (See DIOCESE OF MODERN ATHENS.) Since 1833 the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Greek Rife has undergone serious changes of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, for it no longer recognizes the leadership of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, but is a national autocephalous church.
