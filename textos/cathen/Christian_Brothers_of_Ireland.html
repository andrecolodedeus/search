<h1>Christian Brothers of Ireland</h1>  

<p>An institute founded at Waterford, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1802, by <a href="../cathen/13040b.htm">Edmund Ignatius Rice</a>, a merchant of that city. At the close of the eighteenth century a cloud of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and misery hung over the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the inevitable result of two centuries of dreadful penal enactments. During those unhappy years it was illegal either for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> his children as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or for a teacher to undertake the work. The wretched state of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> boys of Waterford excited the pity of Mr. Rice. He had some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of joining a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order on the Continent, but the miserable state of his surroundings decided his future course. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the Most Reverend Dr. Hussey warmly approved of his intention and promised him every support.

<p>Mr. Rice's career as a merchant came to an end in 1800, and his whole fortune and future life were devoted to the great work he had selected. In 1802, in Waterford, he opened his first <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, assisted for a time by a few secular teachers. Soon after, some <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> young men, drawn by the influence of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and example, came to his assistance and in 1803 a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was built for them by the citizens of Waterford. As the number of assistants increased and the reputation of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> became known through the island, many applications for brothers reached Mr. Rice. Houses were soon opened in Carrick-on-Suir, Dungarvan, and <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10609b.htm">Most Rev. Dr. Moylan</a>, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, summoned a meeting of the principal citizens and expressed to them a strong desire to procure similar advantages for that city. Two gentlemen offered to devote their lives and fortunes to the good work, and the first house was opened there in 1811. For almost a century the history of the <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Christian Brothers'</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a> has been one unbroken record of progress in primary, secondary, and technical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10646b.htm">Most Rev. Dr. Murray</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, in 1812, established a community in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. A second community was founded in 1818 and in 1907 there were ten communities in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> more than 6000 Pupils. These establishments comprise not only extensive primary and secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> but <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and a large deaf and dumb institution, The Limerick community was founded in 1816 and enlargements were made in 1825 and 1828, while many houses were opened later on in the principal towns of the country.

<p>In 1820 came the crowning of Mr. Rice's work in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Apostolic Brief</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> constituted his little band of workers into a religious institute of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Christian Brothers</a> was the first <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> order of men formally approved by a charter from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Encouraged by this great privilege from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and blessed by a regular succession of excellent members, the order gradually spread not only through the principal <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> towns, but also to <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, London, and other large centres in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Having gradually strengthened itself in the British Isles during the remaining years of the nineteenth century, the institute ultimately extended its influence into distant countries. In 1868 a colony was sent to Australia and so fruitful was the effort that out of a community of four, a province has grown up containing about fifty establishments, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, colleges, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and a flourishing <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. Another extension of great importance.was the opening of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in St. John's, Newfoundland (1875). From the beginning the efforts of the brothers there have been very successful, and through the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy of the Benevolent <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Society there are now five large institutions under their management. Between the regimental <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> on one side and those of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a> on the other, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was at a very low ebb in Gilbraltar, when the Most Rev. Dr. Scandella introduced the brothers there in 1878. Soon the whole aspect was changed, and there are now on the four establishments of the highest repute. From Gibrater to New Zealand and from <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a> to <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, the brothers had carried the standard of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> monastic <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, when, in 1886, Cardinal Simeoni conveyed to the superior general of the wish of the Holy Father that they should extend their influence to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The Superior at once complied, and at present there is a flourishing province there with many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, colleges. Since receiving the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> in 1820, no event in its history was of greater moment to the order than the request of the Holy Father, through Cardinal Jacobini, to the superior general, to send a community of brothers to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1900). The proselytizing efforts of <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> and American agencies had given the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> some anxiety, and to counteract these insidious influences the Holy Father called the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> brothers to his side. The result amply justified his confidence. A foundation was made in New York, the first in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1906.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Christian Brothers</a> are of many types, representing divers phases of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work, primary, secondary and industrial, with <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the deaf and dumb. These various institutions are nearly all equipped with laboratories for the practical teaching of physical and chemical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and in many cases with workshops for manual training. Their secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges crown the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> edifices, affording to clever boys, irrespective of their position in life, an opportunity of pursuing a course of higher studies which would be otherwise entirely denied them. In foreign countries provinces of the order are established with the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but as prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, the whole institute is governed by the superior general, who, with his assistants, resides at St. Mary's, Marino, Dublin.
