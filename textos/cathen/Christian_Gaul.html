<h1>Christian Gaul</h1>  

<p>The Church of Gaul first appeared in history in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> under <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> (177). The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> inhabitants rose up against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and forty-eight <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> suffered death under various tortures. Among them there were children like the slave Blandina and Ponticus, a youth of fifteen. Every rank of life had members among the first <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the Church of Gaul: the aristocracy were represented by Vettius Epagathus; the professional class by Attalus of <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamus</a>, a physician; a <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a> Maturus, died beside Pothinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and Sanctus, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Vienne. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and Vienne in a letter to their brethren of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> give an account of this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and the letter preserved by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.1-4</a>, is one the gems of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature. In this document the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> seems to be the only church organized at the time in Gaul. That of Vienne appears to have been dependent on it and, to judge from similar cases, was probably administered by a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. How or where <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> first gained a foothold in Gaul is purely a matter of conjecture. Most likely the first missionaries came by sea, touched at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, and progressed up the Rhone till they established the religion at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> and centre of communication for the whole country. The firm establishment of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Gaul was undoubtedly due to missionaries from <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. Pothinus was a disciple of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna</a>, as was also his successor, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>. In the time of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, Lyons was still the centre of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Gaul. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> speaks of letters written by the Churches of Gaul of which <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> is <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.23</a>). These letters were written on the occasion of the second event which brought the Church of Gaul into prominence. <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> was not celebrated on the same day in all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities; towards the end of the second century Pope Victor wished to universalize the Roman usage and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the Churches of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> intervened to restore peace. About the same time, in a mystical inscription found at <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, a certain Pectorius celebrated in Greek verse the <a href="../cathen/06083a.htm">Ichthus</a> or fish, symbol of the Eucharist. A third event in which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul appear is the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> controversy. Faustinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and other colleagues in Gaul are mentioned in 254 by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (Ep. lxviii) as opposed to <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, whereas Marcianus of Axles was favourable to him.

<p>No other positive information concerning the Church of Gaul is available until the fourth century. Two groups of narratives, however, aim to fill in the gaps. On the one hand a series of local legends trace back the foundation of the principal sees to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Early in the sixth century we find St. Caesarius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles, crediting these stories; regardless of the anachronism, he makes the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a>, Daphnus, whose signature appears at the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (314), a disciple of the Apostles (Lejay, Le r&ocirc;le th&eacute;ologique de C&eacute;saire d'Arles, p. 5). One hundred years earlier one of his predecessors, Patrocles, based various claims of his Church on the fact that St. Trophimus, founder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Arles, was a disciple of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Such claims were no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> flattering to local vanity; during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and in more recent times many legends grew up in support of them. The evangelization of Gaul has often been attributed to missionaries sent from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by St. Clement--a theory, which has inspired a whole series of fallacious narratives and forgeries, with which history is encumbered. More <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be placed in a statement of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> in his "Historia Francorum" (I, xxviii), on which was based the second group of narratives concerning the evangelisation of Gaul. According to him, in the year 250 <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> sent seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who founded as many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> in Gaul: Gatianus the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, Trophimus that of Arles, Paul that of Narbonne, Saturninus that of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, Denis that of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Stremonius (Austremonius) that of Auvergne (Clermont), and Martialis that of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory's</a> statement has been accepted with more or less reservation by serious historians. Nevertheless even though <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory</a>, a late successor of Gatianus, may have had access to information on the beginnings of his church, it must not be forgotten that an interval of three hundred years separates him from the events he chronicles; moreover, this statement of his involves some serious chronological difficulties, of which he was himself aware, e.g. in the case of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The most we can say for him is that he echoes a contemporary tradition, which represents the general point of view of the sixth century rather than the actual facts. It is impossible to say how much legend is mingled with the reality.

<p>By the middle of the third century, as <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> bears witness, there were several churches organized in Gaul. They suffered little from the great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Constantius Chlorus, the father of Constantine, was not hostile to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and soon after the cessation of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Latin world assembled at Arles (314). Their signatures, which are still extant, prove that the following sees were then in existence: Vienne, <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, Arles, Orange, <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a>, Apt, <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, Gabali, and Eauze. We must also admit the existence of the Sees of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, Narbonne, <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. This date marks the beginning of a new era in the history of the Church of Gaul. The towns had been early won over to the new Faith; the work of evangelization was now extended and continued during the fourth and fifth centuries. The cultured classes, however, long remained faithful to the old traditions. Ausonius was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but gives so little evidence of it that the fact has been questioned. Teacher and <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>, he lived in the memories of the past. His pupil Paulinus entered the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, at which, however, the world of letters was deeply <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>; so much so, indeed, that Paulinus had to write to Ausonius to justify himself. At the same period there were <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rhetoricians who celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, as at <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, the virtues and deeds of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors. By the close of the fifth century, however, the majority of scholars in Gaul were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Generation by generation the change came about. Salvianus, the fiery <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> (died c. 492), was the son of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary of Poitiers</a>, Sulpicius Severus (the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Sallust), <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus of Nola</a>, and Sidonius Apollinaris strove to reconcile the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the world of letters. Sidonius himself is not altogether free from suggestions of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> handed down by tradition. In Gaul as elsewhere the question arose as to whether the Gospel could really adapt itself to literary culture. With the inroads of the barbarians the discussion came to an end.



<p>It is none the less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that throughout the Empire the progress of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had been made chiefly in the cities. The country-places were yet strongholds of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, which in Gaul was upheld by a twofold tradition. The old Gallic religion, and Graeco-Roman <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, still had ardent supporters. More than that, among the Gallo-Roman population the use of spells and charms for the cure of sickness, or on the occasion of a death, was much in vogue; the people worshipped springs and trees, believed in fairies, on certain days clothed themselves in skins of animals, and resorted to magic and the practice of divination. Some of these customs were survivals of very ancient traditions; they had come down through the Celtic and the Roman period, and had no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> at times received the imprint of the Gallic and Graeco-Roman <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. Their real origin must of course, be sought further back in the same obscurity in which the beginnings of folk-lore are shrouded. This mass of popular <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, fancies, and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> still lives. It was the principal obstacle encountered by the missionaries in the rural places. St. Martin, a native of Pannonia, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and founder of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, undertook especially in Central Gaul a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against this rural <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. On one occasion, when he was felling a sacred tree in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, a peasant attacked him, and he had an almost <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> escape. Besides St. Martin other popular preachers traversed the rural districts, e.g. Victricius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, another converted soldier, also Martin's disciples, especially St. Martin of Brives. But their scattered and intermittent efforts made no lasting effect on the minds of the peasants. About 395 a Gallic rhetorician depicts a scene in which peasants discuss the mortality among their flocks. One of them boasts the virtue of the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, "the sign of that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who alone is worshipped in the large cities" (Riese, Anthologia Latina, no. 893, v. 105). This expression, however, is too strong, for at that very period a single church sufficed for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Nevertheless the rural parts continued the more refractory. At the beginning of the fifth century, there took place in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> the procession of Cybele's chariot to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the harvest. In the sixth century, in the city of Arles, one of the regions where <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had gained its earliest and strongest foothold, Bishop Caesarius was still struggling against popular <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>, and some of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> are yet among our important sources of information on folk-lore.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianization</a> of the lower classes of the people was greatly aided by the newly established <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. In Gaul as elsewhere the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ascetics lived in the world and kept their personal freedom. The practice of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in common was introduced by St. Martin (died c. 397) and Cassian (died c. 435). Martin established near Tours the "grand monast&egrave;re", i.e. Marmoutier, where in the beginning the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> lived in separate grottoes or wooden huts. A little later Cassian founded two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> (415). He had previously visited the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the East, and especially <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and had brought back their methods, which he adapted to the circumstances of Gallo-Roman life. Through two of his works "De institutis coenobiorum" and the "Collationes XXIV", he became the doctor of Gallic asceticism. About the same time Honoratus founded a famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the little isle of L&eacute;rins (Lerinum) near <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> destined to become a centre of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> influence. Episcopal sees of Gaul were often objects of competition and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a>, and were rapidly becoming the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of certain aristocratic <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, all of whose representatives in the episcopate were not as wise and upright as Germanus of Auxerre or Sidonius Apollinaris. L&eacute;rins took up the work of reforming the episcopate, and placed many of its own sons at the head of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: Honoratus, Hilary, and Caesarius at Arles; Eucherius at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and his sons Salonius and Veranius at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> and Vence respectively; Lupus at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>; Maximus and <a href="../cathen/06019b.htm">Faustus</a> at Riez. L&eacute;rins too became a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and spread its religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> far and wide by useful works on <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, polemics, and <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiography</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded in Gaul, e.g. Grigny near Vienne, Ile Barbe at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, R&eacute;om&eacute; (later known as Moutier-Saint-Jean), Morvan, Saint-Claude in the Jura, Chinon, Loches etc. It is possible, however, that some of these foundations belong to the succeeding period. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had not yet begun to live according to any fixed and codified rule. For such written constitutions we must await the time of <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">Caesarius of Arles</a>. Monasticism was not established without opposition. Rutilius Namatianus, a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, denounced the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of L&eacute;rins as a brood of night-owls; even the effort to make chastity the central virtue of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> met with much resistance, and the adversaries of Priscillian in particular were imbued with this hostility to a certain degree. It was also one of the objections raised by Vigilantius of Calagurris, the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whom <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> denounced so vigorously. Vigilantius had spent much time in Gaul and seems to have died there. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">ecclesiastical celibacy</a> was less stringent, less generally enforced than in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The series of Gallic councils before the Merovingian epoch bear witness at once to the undecided state of discipline at the time, and also to the continual striving after some fixed disciplinary code.

<p>The Church of Gaul passed through three dogmatic crises. Its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> seem to have been greatly preoccupied with <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>; as a rule they clung to the teaching of Nicaea, in spite of a few temporary or partial defections. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, who had been exiled to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (336-38), exerted a powerful influence on the episcopate of Gaul; one of the great champions of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> in the West was <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">Hilary of Poitiers</a>, who also suffered exile for his constancy. Priscillianism had a greater hold on the masses of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. It was above all a method, an ideal of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, which appealed to all, even to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. It was condemned (380) at the Synod of Saragossa where the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> and Agen were present; none the less it spread rapidly in Central Gaul, Eauze in particular being a stronghold. When in 385 the usurper Maximus put Priscillian and his friends to death, St. Martin was in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> how to act, but repudiated with horror communion with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had condemned the unfortunates. Priscillianism, indeed, was more or less bound up with the cause of asceticism in general. Finally the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Gaul were long divided over <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>. Proculus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, had <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> Leporius, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, to leave Gaul, but it was not long until <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> and L&eacute;rins, led by Cassian, Vincent and Faustus, became hotbeds of a teaching opposed to St. Augustine's and known as Semipelagianism. Prosper of Aquitaine wrote against it, and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take refuge at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was not until the beginning of the sixth century that the teaching of Augustine triumphed, when a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of L&eacute;rins, <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">Caesarius of Arles</a>, an almost servile disciple of Augustine, caused it to be adopted by the Council of Orange (529).

<p>In the final struggle <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> interfered. We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> much concerning the earlier relations between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The position of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">Easter Controversy</a> shows a considerable degree of independence; yet <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> proclaimed the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Rome</a>. About the middle of the third century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was appealed to for the purpose of settling difficulties in the Church of Gaul and to remove an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Cyprian, Epist. lxviii). At the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (314) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul were present with those of Brittany, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, even <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; Pope Sylvester sent delegates to represent him. It was in a way a Council of the West. During all that century, however, the episcopate of Gaul had no head, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> grouped themselves according to the ties of friendship or locality. Metropolitans did not exist as yet, and when advice was needed <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> was consulted. "The traditional authority", says Duchesne, "in all matters of discipline remained always the ancient Church of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; in practice, however, the Council of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> decided in case of conflict." The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> then took the situation in hand, and in 417 <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> made Patrocles, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles, his vicar or delegate in Gaul, and provided that all disputes should be referred to him. Moreover, no Gallic ecclesiastic could have access to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> without testimonial letters from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles. This primacy of Arles waxed and waned under the succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. It enjoyed a final period of brilliancy, under Caesarius, but after his time it conferred on the occupant merely an honorary title. In consequence, however, of the extensive authority of Arles in the fifth and sixth centuries, canonical discipline was more rapidly developed there, and the "Libri canonum" that were soon in vogue in Southern Gaul were modelled on those of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Arles. Towards the end of this period Caesarius assisted at a series of councils, thus obtaining a certain recognition as legislator for the Merovingian Church.

<p>The barbarians, however, were on the march. The great invasion of 407 made the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> masters of all the country to the south of the Loire, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> and Clermont, which did not fall into their hands until 475; Arles succumbed in 480. Then the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoth</a> kingdom was organized, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> in religion, and at first hostile to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Gradually the necessities of life imposed a policy of moderation. The <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a>, really a national council of <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> Gaul (506), and in which Caesarius was dominant, is an evidence of the new temper on both sides. The Acts of this council follow very closely the principles laid down in the "Breviarium Alarici" &#151; a summary of the Theodocian Code drawn up by Alaric II, the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> king, for his Gallo-Roman subjects &#151; and met with the approval of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his kingdom. Between 410 and 413 the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a> had settled near Mains; in 475 they had come farther south along the Rhone, and about this time became <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, soon to be masters of all Gaul, left the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, defeated Syagrius in 486, and established their power as far as the Loire. In 507 they destroyed the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoth</a> Kingdom, and in 534 that of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>; in 536 by the conquest of Arles they succeeded to the remnants of the great state created by the genius of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">King Theodoric</a>; with them began a new era (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">F<font size=-2>RANKS</font></a>).

<p>The transition from one regime to another was made possible by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had frequently played a beneficent r&ocirc;le as intermediaries with the Roman authorities. Before the barbarian invasions they were the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> champions of the people. Indeed it was long believed that they had been invested with special powers and the official title of <em>defensores civitatum</em> (defenders of the States). While this title was never officially borne by them, the popular <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was only formal and superficial. Bishops like Sidonius Apollinaris, Avitus, Germanus of Auxerre, <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">Caesarius of Arles</a>, were truly the defenders of their fatherland. While the old civic institutions were tottering to their fall, they upheld the social fabric. Through their efforts the barbarians became amalgamated with the native population, introducing into it the germs of a new and vigorous life. Lastly the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were the guardians of the classical traditions of Latin literature and Roman culture, and long before the appearance of monasticism had been the mainstay of learning. Throughout the sixth and seventh centuries <a href="../cathen/09627a.htm">manuscripts of the Bible</a> and the Fathers were copied to meet the needs of public worship, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> teaching, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life. The only contemporary buildings that exhibit traces of classical or Byzantine styles are <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">religious edifices</a>. For all this, and for much more, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul deserve the title of "Makers of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>".
