<h1>Christian Museum of Lateran</h1>  

<p>Established by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1854, in the Palazzo del Laterano erected by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> on the part of the site of the ancient Lateran palace destroyed by fire in 1308. In 1843 the "profane" Museum of the Lateran was founded by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, in whose pontificate also was mooted the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of establishing a museum of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquities in the same edifice. Nothing of consequence, however, was accomplished until <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, at the date noted, entrusted the task to the two famous arch&aelig;ologists, Father Marchi, S.J., and <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">Giovanni Battista de Rossi</a>. To Marchi was assigned the work of collecting and arranging the sculptured monuments of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ages, to de Rossi all that concerned <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">ancient Christian inscriptions</a>; a third department of the museum consisted of copies of some of the more important <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> frescoes. The larger part of the material for the new foundation was drawn from the hall in the Vatican Library set apart by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, in 1750, as the nucleus of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments from the Capitoline Museum, while many others were recovered from <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, sacristies, and private collections. Plaster casts were also supplied of certain especially interesting monuments that could not be removed from their original location. The result has been eminently satisfactory, so much so indeed that the Christian Museum of the Lateran contains today a collection of monuments the study of which is indispensable to a proper appreciation of the earlier ages of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The section devoted to early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> epigraphy, classified by de Rossi, begins with a collection of inscriptions relating to the most ancient <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptisteries</a>, etc.; then follow in order the Damasan inscriptions, inscriptions with consular dates, those containing allusions to <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, civil matters, and accompanied with such symbols as the anchor, dove, and monogram. Still another section is occupied by monuments with inscriptions classified according to their topography. The most interesting, perhaps, of all the inscribed monuments of the museum is that containing the famous epitaph of Abercius, one fragment of which was presented to <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> by the Sultan Abdul Hamid II, the other by Professor (now Sir William) Ramsay. The sculptured monuments include a fine collection of fourth and fifth century sarcophagi, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a>, and an admirable third-century <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Good Shepherd. The third section of the museum consists of copies, not always accurate, of some of the most interesting <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> discovered in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a>.
