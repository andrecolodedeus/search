<h1>Christian Museums</h1>  

<p>Though applicable to collections composed of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> objects representative of all epochs, this term is usually reserved to those museums which abound chiefly in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> objects antedating the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, namely, Sarcophagi, inscriptions and products of the minor arts. These objects, as also those peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, are found in a large number of museums, but not many of these institutions are exclusively or even primarily devoted to them. The first collections that were formed by <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a>, (by the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, etc.) occasionally included the earlier types or works of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> art, but more on account of their artistic merit than because of their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> character. Collections of inscriptions had been made from the time of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, but <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">Christian inscriptions</a> found no place among them. It was not until after the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a> by Antonio Bosio that these inscriptions were visited by collectors from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and other cities. The first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> museum, properly so called, was that of the Vatican, and its origin dates from <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, who founded it under the name of "Museum Christianum". Thanks to Marchi and de Rossi, a part of the Vatican collections was taken to form the Lateran Museum, founded by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1854. For <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquities no other museums equal the latter in point of importance. During the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1740-50) a taste for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquities was developed by other distinguished men, e.g., <a href="../cathen/11521c.htm">Cardinal Passionei</a> and <a href="../cathen/12614d.htm">Cardinal Quirini</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, whose diligent searches were prolific of important results.

<p>Italy is particularly rich in valuable collections of antique <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> relics. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, besides the Christian Museums of the Vatican and the Veteran the Museo Kircheriano and the San Paolo, <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, and Campo Santo collections are all noteworthy. The atria of certain churches, e.g., St. Mark Santa Maria in Trastevere and St Agnes, also the Grotte Vaticane, have <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">Christian inscriptions</a> or <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a>, and collections of inscriptions have been made in the vicinity of several <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a>, e.g., <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">St. Domitilla</a> and St. Agnes; mention should be made also of private collections. Moreover, almost all the large museums of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the treasuries of some churches have objects belonging to the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era, e.g., the Museum and Library of <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> and those of the Uffizi at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, the municipal Museum of Florence, the Trivulzi collection, the treasuries of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and Monza, the Museo Nazionale at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, the Museum of the Villa Cassia at <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a>, etc. Outside of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, important collections of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquities are less numerous, although those of Cairo, <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, of St. Louis of Carthage (the Lavigerie Museum), of Arles, <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, etc. deserve mention. The museums of the great capitals, London, Paris, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, etc., and the treasuries of some churches, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, have ivories and various woven stuffs <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> epoch. Such woven stuffs, principally of Coptic origin, and very ancient, have lately been introduced into many collections. Church treasuries, especially the richer ones of some German churches (<a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of Cologne, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> and the abbatial church of Essen, etc.), are noted for their <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> relics and may pass for the oldest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> museums.

<p>In addition to the large museums of all countries, many museums of industrial art, provincial museums, private collections and archaeological <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, also episcopal museums, e.g., the rich ones of Cologne and Utrecht, contain many valuable and ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> relics of an artistic kind. As a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> museum of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, the Schnutgen collection at Cologne deserves special notice. It contains many religious objects, <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a>, crosses, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vestments, etc., and offers a better opportunity than any other collation for studying the changing forms of these objects from age to age. A word is due to the museums of copies or reproductions annexed to certain institutions of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The most remarkable <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> museum of this kind is that of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, founded 1849-1855 by Ferdinand Piper. Although largely representative of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, it is unparalleled for its facsimiles of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquities. More recently M.G. Millet founded at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, a Byzantine museum, rich in copies and stereotypes gathered during the explorations and study tours made by French scholars. (See <a href="../cathen/09014a.htm">CHRISTIAN MUSEUM OF LATERAN</a>; <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">VATICAN</a>.)
