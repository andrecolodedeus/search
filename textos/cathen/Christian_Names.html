<h1>Christian Names</h1>  

<p>"<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> names", says the Elizabethan antiquary, Camden, "were imposed for the distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, surnames for the difference of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>."

<p>It would seem from this that, even in the sixteenth century, the etymological and historical significance of the phrase "Christian name" was growning dim, and it is commonly quite forgotten in our own <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. But, strictly speaking, the "Christian name" is not merely the forename distinctive of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> member of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, but the name given to him at his "christening", i.e., his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.

<p>It should be remembered that, in <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">pre-Reformation England</a> the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were taught to administer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in case of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> with the words: "I <em>christen</em> thee in the name of the Father" etc. To "christen" is therefore to "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>", and "Christian name" means baptismal name.
<h2>Origins</h2>

<p>Some vague <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that <em>nomina sunt omina</em> ("names are omens") seems to be a sort of primitive <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a>. Thus throughout <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> times the significance of names passed as an accepted principle. They were usually given in reference either to some trait in the child, actual or prophetic or to some feeling or hope in the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parent</a> at the time of its birth.

<p>It was only a very slight development of this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to suppose that a change of <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> appropriately demanded a change of name. Thus the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of Abram into <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> (the "father of many nations" <a href="../bible/gen017.htm#vrs5">Genesis 17:5</a>) was imposed upon the occasion of the covenant of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and ratified a claim to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> special <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">benediction</a>.

<p>In view, then, of this recognized congruity and of the Hebrew practice of giving a <a href="../cathen/10675a.htm">name</a> to the male child at the time of its <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> on the eighth day after birth (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs59">Luke 1:59</a>), it has been maintained that the <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> of conferring a name upon the newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptised</a> was of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> origin. An instance in point is declared to be found in the case of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> was called Saul and afterwards Paul. But modern scholarship, and with reason, has altogether rejected this contention. The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is recorded in <a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs18">Acts 9:18</a>, but the name <em>Paul</em> does not occur before <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs9">Acts 13:9</a> while <em>Saul</em> is found several times in the interval. We have no more reason to connect the name Paul with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle's</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> than we have to account in the same way for the giving of the name Cephas or <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be due to another <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.

<p>Moreover, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, both from the <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscriptions of the catacombs</a> and from early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature, that the names of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the first three centuries did not distinctively differ from the names of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> around them. A reference to the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> makes it plain that even the names of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> gods and goddesses were borne by his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> after their <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> as before. Hermes occurs in <a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs14">Romans 16:14</a>, with a number of other purely <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> names, Epaphroditus in <a href="../bible/phi004.htm#vrs18">Philippians 4:18</a>, Phoebe, the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a>, in <a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs1">Romans 16:1</a>. Not less conclusive are the names which we find in the <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">Christian inscriptions</a> of the earlier period or in the signatories appended to such councils as Nicaea or <a href="../cathen/01465a.htm">Ancyra</a> (see Turner, "Eccl. Occident. Mon. Juris", I, 36-90; II, 50-53), or again in the lists of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Even at a later <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the names are of a most miscellaneous character. The following classification is one that has been worked out by J. Bass Mullinger founded on <a href="../cathen/09723b.htm">Martigny</a>.

<p><em>A. Names without Christian significance and probably derived from pagan ancestors</em>

<p>This category may be divided as follows: <ul> <li>Names derived unchanged or but slightly modified from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> mythology, e.g., Mercurius, Bacchus, Apollos (<a href="../bible/1co016.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>), Hermogenes (<a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs4">Romans 16:4</a>), etc.; <li>from religious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> or omens, e.g., Augustus, Auspicius, Augurius, Optatus; <li>from numbers, e.g., Primus, Primigenius, Secundinus, Quartus, Octavia, etc.; <li>from colours, e.g., Albanus, Candidus, Rufus, etc.; <li>from animals and <a href="../cathen/02576b.htm">birds</a>, e.g., Agnes, Asellus, Columbia, Leo, Taurus, Ursula, etc.; <li>from agriculture, e.g., Agricia, Armentarius, Palmatinus, Stereorius, etc.; <li>from flowers, e.g., Balsamia, Flosculus, Narcissus, Rosula; <li>from jewels, e.g., Chrysanthus, Margarites, Smaragdus; <li>from military life or the sea, e.g., Emerentiana, Navigia, Pelagia, Seutarius, Thalassus; <li>from countries, cities, rivers etc.; Afra, Cydnus, Galla, Jordanis, Macedonius, Maurus, Sabina, Sebastianus, etc.; <li>from the months e.g., Aprilis, Januaria, Junia, etc.; <li>from personal qualities, etc., e.g., Aristo, Hilarius, Modestus, Pudens etc.; <li>from servile condition, e.g., Servus, Servilianus, Vernacla; <li>names of historical celebrity, e.g., Caesarius, Cornelia, Pompeius, Ptolemaeus, Vergilius.</ul>

<p><em>B. Names of Christian origin and significance</em>

<p>These include the following: <ul> <li>Names apparently suggested by <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">Christian dogmas</a> e.g., Anastasia, Athanasia, Christophorus, Redemptus, Restitutus, etc.; <li>from <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festivals</a> or <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, e.g., Epiphanius, Eulogia, Natalis, Pascasia, Sabbatius and the frequently recurring Martyrius; <li>from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, e.g., Agape, Elpis, Fides, Irene, with such derivatives as Adelphius, Agapetus, Caritosa, etc.; <li>pious sentiment, e.g., Adeodata, Ambrosius, Benedictus, Deogratias, etc., and possibly such names as Gaudentianus, Hilarius, Sozomen, Victorianus, Vincentius, but it is very hard to be sure that any distinctively <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> feeling is here latent. </ul>

<p>On the other hand though the recurrence of such names as Agnes, Balbina, Cornelius, Felicitas, Irenaeus, Justinus, etc. may very probably be due to <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who first bore these names, it is rather curious that the names of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are but rarely found while those of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are hardly less uncommon. Susanna, Daniel, Moyses, Tobias, occur pretty frequently, but it is only towards the end of the fourth century that we find the name of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">our Blessed Lady</a> or become at all familiar with those of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Even then we cannot be sure that in the case of Paulus in particular there is any intentional reference to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle of the Gentiles</a>, but Johannes at least, and Andreas, with Petrus and its derivatives like Petronia, Petrius, Petronilla, etc. are less open to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15464a.htm">name of Mary</a> occurs occasionally in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscriptions</a> towards the close of the fourth century, for example, in the form <font size=-2>LIVIA MARIA IN PACE</font> (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Rom. Sot.", I, 143) and there is a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Maria assigned to to the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> A.D. 256 (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Rom. Sot." III, 200 sqq. and compare other instances of the name, <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, (Insc. Christ. I, 331; II, 160 and 173).
<h2>Change of name at baptism</h2>

<p>If we could trust the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> and contemporary character of the Acts of St. Balsamus, who died A.D. 331, we should have an early example of the connection between <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the giving of a name. "By my paternal name", this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> is said to have declared, "I am called Balsamus, but by the spiritual name which I received in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, I am known as Peter." It would seem in any case that the assumption of a new name for some devotional reason was fairly common among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> the historian took the name Pamphili from <a href="../cathen/11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> whom he especially <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>. Earlier still <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> chose to be called Cyprianus Caecilius out of gratitude to the Caecilius to whom he owed his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. Moreover <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">St. Dionysius of Alexandria</a> (c. 260) declared "I am of opinion that there were many of the same name as the <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Apostle John</a>, who on account of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for him, and because they admired and emulated him, and desired to be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> as he was, took to themselves the same name, just as many of the children of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are called Paul or Peter" (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.25</a>). It would be only natural that the assumption, of any such new name should take place formally at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>, then probably as now, had to be addressed by some distinctive appellation. On the other hand it seems likely that the imposition of a new name at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> had become general. Every child had necessarily to receive some name or other, and when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> followed soon after birth, this must have offered a very suitable opportunity for the public recognition of the choice made.

<p>No doubt the thirtieth of the supposed <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> Canons of Nicaea: "Of giving only names of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>" is not <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a>, even though it is of early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> seem to assume in many different places that the conferring of a name, presumably at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, ought to be regulated by some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> edification, and he implies though this does not seem to be borne out by the evidence now available, that such had been the practice of earlier generations. For example he says: "When it comes to giving the infant a name, caring not to call it after the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as the ancients at first did, people light <a href="../cathen/08770a.htm">lamps</a> and give them names and so name the child after the one which continues burning the longest, from thence conjecturing that he will live a long <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>" (<a href="../fathers/220112.htm"><em>Homily 12 on First Corinthians</em>, no. 13</a>). Similarly he commends the practice of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of Antioch in calling their children after the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/10161b.htm">Meletius</a> (P.G., L, 515) and again he urges his hearers not to give their children the first name that occurs, nor to seek to gratify fathers or grandfathers or other <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> connections by giving <em>their</em> names, but rather to choose the names of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men conspicuous for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and for their <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (P.G., LIII, 179).


<p>History preserves sundry examples of such a change of name in adult <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a>. <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (<a href="../fathers/26017.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.21</a>) tells us of Athenais who married the Emperor Theodosius the Younger, and who previously to marriage was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> (A.D. 421) receiving the name Eudoxia. Again <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> tells us of the case of King Caedwalla who went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13728b.htm">Pope Sergius</a> who gave him the name of Peter. Dying soon afterwards he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and his epitaph beginning "Hic depositus est Caedwalla qui est Petrus" was long pointed out (<a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, "Hist. Eccl.", V, vii). Later we have the well-known instance of Guthrum the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> leader in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> who after his long contest with <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">King Alfred</a> was eventually defeated and <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consenting</a> to accept <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in 878 by the &AElig;thelstan.
<h2>Practice regarding names</h2>

<p>But while various <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and spiritual writers, and here and there a synodal <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, have exhorted the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to give no names to their children in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> but those of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels of God</a>, it must be confessed that there has never been a <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> when these injunctions have been at all strictly attended to.

<p>They were certainly not heeded during the early or the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Any one who glances even casually at an extensive list of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> names, such as are perhaps best found in the indexes to the volumes of legal proceedings which have been edited in modern times, will at once perceive that while ordinary names without any very pronounced religious associations, such as William, Robert, Roger, Geoffrey, Hugh, etc. enormously preponderate (William about the year 1200 was by far the most common <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>), there are also always a very considerable number of exceptional and out-of-the-way names which have apparently no religious associations at all. Such names, to take but a few specimens, as Ademar, Ailma, Ailward, Albreza, Alditha, Almaury, Ascelina, Avice, Aystorius (these come from the lists of those cured at the shrine of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>) are of quite frequent occurrence.

<p>The point however cannot be dwelt on here. We may note on the other hand that a <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> in the official "Rituale Romanum" enjoins that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ought to see that unbecoming or ridiculous names of deities or of godless <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> are not given in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (<em>curet ne obscoena, fabulosa aut ridicula vel inanium deorum vel impiorum ethnicorum hominum nomina imponantur</em>). Some of the seventeeth century French rituals have gone further than this. For example that of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> (1666) addressing <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and godparents urges: "Let them give to boys the names of male <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and to girls those of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as right order requires, and let them avoid the names of <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festivals</a> like <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (P&acirc;ques), <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> (No&euml;l), All Saints (Toussaint) and others that are sometimes chosen." Despite such injunctions "Toussaint" has become a not uncommon <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name and "No&euml;l" has spread even to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The addition of Marie, especially in the form Jean-Marie, for boys, and of Joseph for girls is of everyday occurrence.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> again, ardent <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to our Blessed Lady</a> has not remained content with the simple name Maria, but many of her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festivals</a> etc. have also created names for girls: Concepti&oacute;n, of which the diminutive is Concha, is one of the best known, but we have also Asunci&oacute;n, Encarnaci&oacute;n, Mercedes, Dolores etc. in <a href="../cathen/14192a.htm">Spanish</a>, and in Italian Assunta, Annunziata, Concetta, etc. It is strange on the other hand that the name Mary has by no means always been a favourite for girls, possibly from a feeling that it was too august to be so familiarly employed. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the twelfth century Mary as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name is of very rare occurrence. George again is a name which despite the recognition of the warrior saint as <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was by no means common in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, though strangely enough it grew in popularity after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. A writer who has made a minute examination of the registers of <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford University</a> from 1560 to 1621, has made out the following list of the more common names borne by the students in order of popularity: John, 3826; Thomas 2777; William, 2546; Richard, 1691; Robert, 1222; Edward, 957; Henry, 908; George, 647; Francis, 447; James, 424; Nicholas, 326; Edmund, 298 (see Oxford Hist. Soc. Transactions, XIV). In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> it has always been a tolerably common practice to call a child after the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> upon whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> he is born.
<h2>Confirmation names</h2>

<p>The practice of adopting a new name was not limited to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> examples show that any notable change of condition, especially in the spiritual order, was often accompanied by the reception of a new name. In the eighth century the two <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">Englishmen</a>, Winfrith and Willibald, going on different occasions to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> received from the reigning <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontiff</a>, along with a new commission to preach, the names respectively of Boniface and Clement. So again Emma of Normandy, when she married King Ethelred in 1002, took the name &AElig;lfgifu; while, of course, the reception of a new name upon entering a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order is almost universal even in our day. It is not strange, then, that at <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a>, in which the interposition of a godfather emphasizes the resemblance with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, it should have become customary to take a new name, though usually no great use is made of it. In one case, however, that of <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Henry III</a>, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> &#151; who being the godson of our English Edward VI had been christened Edouard Alexandre in 1551 &#151; the same French prince at <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a> received the name of Henri, and by this he afterwards reigned. Even in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the practice of adopting a new name at <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a> was remembered after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, for Sir Edward Coke declares that a man might validly buy land by his <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a> name, and he recalls the case of a Sir Francis Gawdye, late Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, whose name of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was Thomas and his name of <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a> Francis (Co. Litt. 3a).
