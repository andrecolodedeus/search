<h1>Christian and Religious Perfection</h1>  

<p>A thing is perfect in which nothing is wanting of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, purpose, or end. It may be perfect in nature, yet imperfect inasmuch as it has not yet attained its end, whether this be in the same order as itself, or whether, by the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His gratuitous liberality, it be entirely above its nature, i.e. in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. From Revelation we learn that the ultimate end of man is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, consisting in union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> here on earth by grace and hereafter in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. Perfect union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot be attained in this life, so man is imperfect in that he lacks the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> for which he is destined and suffers many evils both of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Perfection therefore in its absolute sense is reserved for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.
<h2>Christian perfection</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> perfection is the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> or spiritual union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which is possible of attainment in this life, and which may be called relative perfection, compatible with the absence of beatitude, and the presence of human miseries, rebellious passions, and even venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to which a just man is liable without a special grace and privilege of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This perfection consists in charity, in the degree in which it is attainable in this life (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs36">Matthew 22:36-40</a>; <a href="../bible/rom013.htm#vrs10">Romans 13:10</a>; <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs14">Galatians 5:14</a>; <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs31">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>, and <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#vrs13">13:13</a>). This is the universal teaching of the Fathers and of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Charity unites the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end, and removes from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> all that is opposed to that union. "God is charity; and he that abideth in charity abideth in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him" (<a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs16">1 John 4:16</a>). Francisco Su&aacute;rez explains that perfection can be attributed to charity in three ways: (1) <em>substantially</em> or <em>essentially</em>, because the essence of union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> consists in charity for the habit as well as for the endeavour or pursuit of perfection; (2) <em>principally</em>, because it has the chief share in the process of perfection; (3) <em>entirely</em>, for all other virtues necessarily accompany charity and are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by it to the supreme end. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope are prerequisites for perfection in this life, but they do not constitute it, for in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, where perfection is complete and absolute, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope no longer remain. The other virtues therefore belong to perfection in a secondary and accidental manner, because charity cannot exist without them and their exercise, but they without charity do not unite the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> supernaturally to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. (Lib. I, De Statu Perfectionis, Cap. iii).

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> perfection consists not only in the habit of charity, i.e. the possession of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> and the constant will of preserving that grace, but also in the pursuit or practice of charity, which means the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and withdrawal of ourselves from those things which oppose or impede it. "Be it ever remembered", says Reginald Buckler, "that the perfection of man is determined by his actions, not by his habits as such. Thus a high degree of habitual charity will not suffice to perfect the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> if the habit pass not into act. That is, if it become not operative. For to what purpose does a man possess virtue if he uses it not? He is not virtuous because he can live virtuously but because he does so." (The Perfection of Man by Charity. Ch. vii, p. 77).

<p>The perfection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> increases in proportion with the possession of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. He who possesses the perfection which excludes mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> obtains <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is said to be just, holy, and perfect. The perfection of charity, which excludes also venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and all affections which separate the heart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, signifies a state of active service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of frequent, fervent acts of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is the perfect fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs37">Matthew 22:37</a>), as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the primary object of charity. The secondary object is our neighbour. This is not limited to <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, but extends to friends, strangers, and enemies, and may advance to a heroic degree, leading a man to sacrifice external goods, comforts and life itself for the spiritual welfare of others. This is the charity taught by Christ by word (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs13">John 15:13</a>) and example. (See <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">T<font size=-2>HEOLOGICAL</font> V<font size=-2>IRTUE OF</font> L<font size=-2>OVE</font></a>).
<h2>Religious perfection</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> perfection, or the perfection of charity as taught by our Saviour, applies to all men, both secular and religious, yet there is also religious perfection. The religious state is called a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (<em>disciplina</em>) of perfection and it imposes an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, more strict than that of the secular state, of striving after perfection. Seculars are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to perfection by the observance of the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> or commandments only; while religious are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to observe also the <a href="../cathen/04435a.htm">evangelical counsels</a> to which they freely bind themselves by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The counsels are the means or instruments of perfection in both a negative and positive sense. <em>Negatively:</em> the obstacles in the way of perfection, which are (<a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#vrs16">1 John 1:16</a>) <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life, are removed by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience, respectively. <em>Positively:</em> the profession of the counsels tends to increase the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The affections, freed from earthly ties, enable the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to cling to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to spiritual things more intensely and more willingly, and thus promote His glory and our own sanctification, placing us in a more secure state for attaining the perfection of charity.

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that seculars who also tend to perfection have to perform many things that are not of precept, but they do not bind themselves irrevocably to the evangelical counsels. It is, however, expedient only for those who are called by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to take upon themselves these <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. In no state or condition of life is such a degree of perfection attainable that further progress is not possible. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on his part can always confer on man an increase of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, and man in turn by cooperating with it can increase in charity and grow more perfect by becoming more intimately and steadfastly united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
