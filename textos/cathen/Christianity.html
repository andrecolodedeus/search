<h1>Christianity</h1>  

<p>In the following article an account is given of Christianity as a religion, describing its origin, its relation to other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and chief characteristics, but not dealing with its doctrines in detail nor its <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a> as a visible organization. These and other aspects of this great subject will receive treatment under separate titles. Moreover, the Christianity of which we speak is that which we find realized in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone; hence, we are not concerned here with those forms which are embodied in the various non-Catholic Christian <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>.

<p>Our documentary sources of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about the origin of Christianity and its earliest developments are chiefly the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament Scriptures</a> and various sub-Apostolic writings, the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticity</a> of which we must to a large extent take for granted here, as the much less grounds we take for granted the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticity</a> of "C&aelig;sar" when dealing with early Gaul, and of "Tacitus" when studying growth of the Roman Empire. (Cf. Kenyon, "Handbook of the Textual Criticism of the N.T."). We have this further warrant for doing so, that the most mature critical opinions amongst non-Catholics, deserting the wild theories of Baur, Strauss, and Renan, tend, in regard to <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> and authorship, to coincide more closely with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, Acts, and most of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> are recognized as belonging to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age. "The oldest literature of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>", says Professor Harnack, "is, in the main points and in most of its details, from the point of view of literary history, veracious and trustworthy . . . . He who attentively studies these letters (those i.e. of <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">Clement</a> and <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>) cannot fail to see what a fullness of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">traditions</a>, topics of preaching, doctrines, and <a href="../cathen/07326a.htm">forms of organization</a> already existed in the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> (A.D. 98-117), and in particular <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> had reached permanence" (Chronologie der altchristlichen Literature, Bk. I, pp. 8, 11). Other points will, of course, be touched on and other results assumed, which are more fully and formally treated under <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">J<font size=-2>ESUS</font> C<font size=-2>HRIST</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">C<font size=-2>HURCH</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">R<font size=-2>EVELATION</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">M<font size=-2>IRACLES</font></a>.

<p>For clearness' sake we shall arrange the subject under the following chief heads:<blockquote>

<p>I. ORIGIN OF CHRISTIANITY AND ITS RELATION WITH OTHER RELIGIONS; <br>II. THE ESSENTIALS OF CHRISTIANITY; <br>III. THE DIVINE PURPOSE IN CHRISTIANITY. </p></blockquote>
<h2 id="section1">Origin of Christianity and its relation with other religions</h2>

<p>Christianity is the name given to that definite system of religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and practice which was taught by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in the country of Palestine, during the reign of the Roman Emperor, <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, and was promulgated, after its <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Founder's</a> death, for the acceptance of the whole world, by certain <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">chosen men</a> among His followers.

<p>According to the accepted <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>, these began their mission on the day of Pentecost, A.D. 29, which day is regarded, accordingly, as the birthday of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>. In order the better to appreciate the meaning of this event, we must first consider the religious influences and tendencies previously at work in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which prepared the way for the spread of Christianity amongst them.

<p>The whole history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as detailed in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is seen, when read in the light of other events, to be a clear though gradual preparation for the preaching of Christianity. In that nation alone, the great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence</a> and <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">unity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> ruling of His creatures and their responsibility towards Him, were preserved unimpaired amidst general corruption. The ancient world was given to <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">creature-worship</a>; <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> only, not because of its "<a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheistic</a> instinct" (Renan), but because of the periodic interposition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, resisted in the main the general tendency to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Besides maintaining those pure conceptions of <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">Deity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> from time to time, and with ever increasing distinctness until we come to the direct and personal testimony of the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Baptist</a>, foreshadowed a fuller and more universal <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> &mdash; a <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> when, and a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> through Whom, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> all the nations of the earth.

<p>We need not here trace the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> predictions in detail; their clearness and cogency are such that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> does not hesitate to say (Retract., I, xiii, 3): "What we now call the Christian religion existed amongst the ancients, and was from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, until <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself came in the flesh; from which <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the already existing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion began to be styled Christian". And thus it has been remarked that <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> alone amongst the nations of antiquity looked forward to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> to come. All peoples alike retained some more or less vague recollection of a <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a> lost, a remote Golden Age, but only the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> kept alive the definite <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of a world-wide empire of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, wherein the Fall of Man should be repaired. The fact that, eventually, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> misinterpreted their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">oracles</a>, and identified the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic Kingdom</a> with a mere temporal sovereignty of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, cannot invalidate the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>, as interpreted both by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own life and the teaching of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, to the gradual evolution of that conception of which Christianity is the full and perfect expression. Mistaken national <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, accentuated by their galling subject to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> led them to read a material significance into the predictions of the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, and hence to love their privilege of being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> chosen people. The wild olive in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> metaphor (<a href="../bible/rom011.htm#vrs17">Romans 11:17</a>) was then grafted upon the stock of the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">patriarchs</a> in place of those rejected branches, and entered upon their spiritual inheritance.

<p>We may trace, too, in the world at large, apart from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> people, a similar though less direct preparation. Whether due ultimately to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> predictions or to the fragments of the original <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> handed down amongst the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>, a certain vague expectation of the coming of a great conqueror seems to have existed in the East and to a certain extent in the Roman worlds, in the midst of which the new religion had its birth. But a much more marked predisposition to Christianity may be noticed in certain prominent features of the Roman religion after the downfall of the republic. The old gods of Latium had long ceased to reign. In their stead Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> occupied the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of the cultured, whilst the populace were attracted by a variety of strange cults imported from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the East. Whatever their corruption, these new <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, concentrating worship on a single prominent <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deity</a>, were <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheistic</a> in effect. Moreover, many of them were characterized by <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of expiation and sacrifice, which familiarized <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a mediatorial religion. They combined to destroy the notion of a nation cultus, and to separate the service of the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">Deity</a> from the service of the State. Finally, as a contributory <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to the diffusion of Christianity, we must not fail to mention the widespread Pax Romana, resulting from the union of the civilized races under one strong central government.

<p>Thus much may be said with regard to the remote preparation of the world for the reception of Christianity. What immediately preceded its institution, as it was born in <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, concerns the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> race alone, and is comprised in the teaching and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His death and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, and the mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.

<p>During his whole mortal <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a> on earth, including the two or three years of His active ministry, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> lived as a devout <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, Himself observing, and insisting on His followers observing, the injunctions of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#vrs3">Matthew 23:3</a>). The sum of His teaching, as of that of His <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">precursor</a>, was the approach of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">"Kingdom of God"</a>, meaning not only the rule of righteousness in the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> heart ("the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> is within you" &mdash; <a href="../bible/luk017.htm#vrs21">Luke 17:21</a>), but also the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (as is plain from many of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>) which He was about to institute.

<p>Yet, though He often foreshadowed a <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> when the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law</a> as such would cease to bind, and though He Himself in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiahship</a> occasionally set aside its provisions ("For the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is Lord even of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>", <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs8">Matthew 12:8</a>), yet, as, in spite of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, He did not win recognition of that <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiahship</a>, still less of His Divinity, from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at large. He confined His explicit teaching about the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to His immediate followers, and left it to them, when the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> came, openly to pronounce the abrogation of the Law. (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs5">Acts 15:5-11, 18</a>; <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs19">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs24">24-28</a>; <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#vrs2">Ephesians 2:2</a>, <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#vrs14">14-15</a>; <a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs16">Colossians 2:16-17</a>; <a href="../bible/heb007.htm#vrs12">Hebrews 7:12</a>)


<p>It was not so much, then, by propounding the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of Christianity as by informing the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> with the spirit of Christian <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethics</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> found Himself able to prepare <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> hearts for the religion to come. Again, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which He failed to arouse by the numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> He wrought, He sought to provide with a further and stronger incentive by dying under every circumstance of pain, disgrace, and defeat, and then raising Himself from the dead in triumph and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. It was to this fact rather than to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonders</a> He worked in His lifetime that His accredited <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> always appealed in their teaching. On the marvel of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> is based in the counsels of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Christianity. "If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again</a>, your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is vain", declares the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs17">1 Corinthians 15:17</a>), who says no word of the other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonders</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> performed. By His death, therefore, and His return from the dead, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the event <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, furnished the strongest means for the effective preaching of the religion He came to found.

<p>The third antecedent <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> to the birth of Christianity, as we learn from the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred records</a>, was a special participation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> given to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> on the day of Pentecost. According to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise, the function of this Divine gift was to teach them all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and bring back to their remembrance all that [<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>] had said to them (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs26">John 14:26</a>; <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs13">16:13</a>). "I send the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Promised of my Father</a> upon you, but remain ye in the <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">city</a> till ye shall be clothed with power from on high" (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs49">Luke 24:49</a>). "John indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water, but you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, not many days hence" (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs5">Acts 1:5</a>). As a result of that Divine visitation we find the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> preaching the Gospel with wonderful <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, persuasiveness, and assurance in the face of hostile <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/07759a.htm">indifferent</a> <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, "the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> working with them and confirming their words by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">signs</a> that followed" (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs20">Mark 16:20</a>).

<p>We have now to consider the circumstances of Christianity at the outset, and to estimate to what extent it was affected by the already existing religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p>It took its rise, as we have seen, in <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>: its <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">founder</a> and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the latter maintained their <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> practices, at least for a time, even after the day of Pentecost. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves looked upon the followers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as a mere <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Israelitish</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> (<em>airesis</em>) like the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> or the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a>, styling <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> "the instigator of the revolt of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Nazarenes" (<a href="../bible/act024.htm#vrs5">Acts 24:5</a>). The new religion was at first wholly confined to the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and it votaries had still a large share of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> exclusiveness; they read the Law, they practised <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and they <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worshipped</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>, as well as in the upper room at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. We need not wonder, then, that some modern <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a>, who reject its <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> origin and ignore the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in its first missionaries, see in early Christianity <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> pure and simple, and find the explanation of its character and growth in the pre-existing religious environment. But this theory of natural development does not fit the facts as narrated in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which is full of indications that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> doctrines were new, and His spirit strange. Consequently, the records have to be mutilated to suit the theory. We cannot pretend to follow, there or in other places, the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> in their <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> criticism. There is the less need of doing so that their theories are often mutually destructive. A dozen years ago an observer computed that since 1850 there had been published 747 theories regarding the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>, of which 608 were by that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> defunct (see Hastings, "Higher Criticism"). The effect of these random hypotheses has been greatly to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> view, which we now proceed to state.

<p>Christianity is developed from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> in the sense that it embodies the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> contained in the latter <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a>, somewhat as a finished <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> embodies the original rough sketch. The same hand was employed in the production of both <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">type</a> and <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a> and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> the Old Dispensation points clearly to the New.

<p>But <a href="../cathen/15107a.htm">type</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> as clearly indicate that the New will be something very different from the Old. No mere organic evolution connects the two. A fuller <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, a more perfect <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>, a wider distribution was to mark the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of the Messias</a>. "The end [or object] of the Law is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>", says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#vrs4">Romans 10:4</a>), meaning that the Law was given to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to excite their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to come. "Wherefore", he says again (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs24">Galatians 3:24</a>), "the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law</a> was our pedagogue unto <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>", leading the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to Christianity as the <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> brought his charges to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> door.

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> reproached the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for not reading their <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> aright. "For if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would perhaps <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me also; for he wrote of me" (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs46">John 5:46</a>). And <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> sums the whole matter up in the striking words: "In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New</a> lies hidden; in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> is made manifest" (<a href="../fathers/1303.htm"><em>On the Catechizing of the Uninstructed</em>, 4.8</a>). But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> claimed to fulfil the Law by substituting the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> for the shadow and the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a>, and, the end having been reached, all that was temporary and provisional in <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> came to a conclusion. Still, a direct divine intervention was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to bring this about, just as, in any rational account of the theory of evolution, recourse must be had to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power to bridge the gulf between <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">being</a> and non-being, <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and non-life, <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and non-reason. "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, at sundry times and in divers manner, spoke in times past to the fathers by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, least of all in these days hat spoken to us by his Son" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs1">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>), the message growing in clearness and in content with each successive utterance till it reached completion in the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a>.

<p>The Christianity, then, which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> preached on the day of Pentecost was entirely distinct from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, especially as understood by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>; it was a new religion, new in its <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Founder</a>, new in much of its <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a>, new in its attitude towards both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, new in the spirit of its <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> code. "The Law was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; grace and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs17">John 1:17</a>).

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, as was to be expected, is our clearest <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> on this point. "If any man be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>", he says, "he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold all things are new" (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs17">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). How new Christianity was, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves showed by putting its <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Author</a> to death and persecuting His adherents. Renan himself, who is not always consistent, admits that "far from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being the continuer of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, what characterizes His work is its breach with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> spirit" (Vie de J&eacute;sus, c. xxviii).

<p>It may be granted that there is a certain resemblance between the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essene</a> communities and the earliest Christian assemblies. But the resemblance is only on the outside. The spirit of the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a> was intensely national; except in the matter of worship in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>, they were ultra-Jewish in their observance of external forms, <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">ablutions</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, etc., and their mode of life and discouragement of marriage were essentially anti-social. Harnack himself owns that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had no relations with this rigoristic <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, as was shown by His mixing freely with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a>, etc. (Das Wesen des Christenthums, Lect. Ii, p. 33, tr.). But Christianity did not reject anything in <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> that was of permanent value, and so the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> on the day of Pentecost could not have felt that they were <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuring</a> their ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but rather that they were then for the first time entering upon the full understanding of it. More will be said on this point when we come to consider what is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of Christianity, but we may notice that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> very early found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to emphasize her distinctness from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> by abandoning the essentially <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, Temple-worship, and observance of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> is not the only religious system that has been requisitioned by <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> writers to account for the appearance of Christianity. Points of similarity between the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and the great <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of the East have been taken to indicated a derivation of the latter system from the earlier, and the elaborate <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> religion has been quoted to account for certain Christian <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> about the future life.

<p>It were a long and not very profitable task to state and refute these various theories in detail. Underlying all of them is the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> postulate which denies the fact and even the possibility of Divine intervention in the evolution of religion. In virtue of that attitude <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> is confronted with the impossible task of explaining how a universal religion like Christianity, with an extensive yet <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> system of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, could have been evolved by a process of promiscuous borrowings from existing cults and yet preserve everywhere its unity and coherence. If the selection were made by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His adherents, <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> must tell us how these "ignorant and unlettered men" (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs13">Acts 4:13</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs54">Matthew 13:54</a>; <a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs2">Mark 6:2</a>) <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of the East, when it was a matter of astonishment to their contemporaries that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their own.

<p>Or, if the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and practices under consideration were the additions of a later age, the questions arise, first, how to reconcile this statement with the fact that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of Christianity is discoverable in the earliest Christian <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> and, secondly, how scattered communities composed of various nationalities and living under different <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> could have united in selecting and maintaining the same <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">rules of conduct</a>.

<p>We may ask, furthermore, why Christianity which, on this hypothesis, only selected pre-existing doctrines, excited everywhere such bitter hostility and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. "About this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>", said the Roman <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, "we are informed that it meets with opposition everywhere" (<a href="../bible/act028.htm#vrs22">Acts 28:22</a>)k.

<p>Immense erudition has been wasted in the attempt to show that <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> in particular is the prototype of Christianity, but, apart from the difficulty of distinguishing the original creed of Gautama from later and possibly post-Christian accretions, it may be briefly objected that <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> is at best only an <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> system, not a religion, for it recognizes no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and no responsibility, that in so far as it emphasizes the comparative worthlessness of earthly things and the insufficiency of earthly delights it is in accord with the Christian spirit, but that in aim it is essentially diverse. The supreme aim of Christianity is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in a state involving the employment of all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> activities, that of <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> the ultimate loss of <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">conscious</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.

<p>Let us grant, once and for all, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> intercourse with His creatures is not confined to the old and New Covenants, and that Christianity includes many doctrines accessible to the unaided <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, and advocates many practices which are the natural outcome of ordinary <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> activities. We thus expect to find that, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> being the same everywhere, the various expressions of the religious sense will take similar shapes amongst all peoples. Accordingly, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> may very well inculcate ascetic practices and possess the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sacrifice and sacrificial banquets, of a <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and confession, of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> like <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, of the accessories of worship such as <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">images</a>, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, <a href="../cathen/09244b.htm">lights</a>, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, etc. Not everything in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> religion is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, nor is everything in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion (or Christianity) <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. "We must not look", says M. M&uuml;ller, "in the original <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> for [distinctively] Christian <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> but for the fundamental religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> on which Christianity is built, without which as its natural and historical support, Christianity could not have become what it is" (Wissenschaft der Sprache, II, 395).

<p>These remarks apply not only to the religious systems which are alleged to have influenced the conception of Christianity, but to those which it met as soon as it issued from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, its cradle. Here, we are face to face with history, and not with mere hypothesis and assumption. For Christianity, on its first essaying to realize its destiny as the universal religion, did actually come in contact with two mighty religious systems, the religion of Rome, and the widespread body of thought, more of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> than a <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a>, prevalent in the Greek-speaking world.

<p>The effect of the national religion of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Rome on early Christianity concerned <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> rather than points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and was due to the general causes just mentioned. With Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, on the other hand, representing the highest efforts of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to explain <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and experience, and to reach the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">Absolute</a>, Christianity, which professes to solve all these problems, had, naturally and necessarily, many points of contact.

<p>It is on this connection that modern <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> have brought all their learning and research to bear in the effort to show that the whole later <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> system of Christianity is something more or less alien to its original conception. It was the transference of Christianity from a <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> to a <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greek</a> soil that explains, according to Dr. Hatch (Hibbert Lectures, 1888), "why an <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a> stood in the forefront of the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a> in the forefront of the Christianity of the fourth century". Professor Harnack states the problem and solves it in similar fashion. He ascribes the change, as he conceives it, from a simple code of conduct to the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>, to the three following causes:

<ul>
<li>The universal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in all development of religion, that when the first generation of <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> who have been in contact, more or less immediate, with the founder, and endowed with his spirit, have passed away, their successors, having no personal grasp of their <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a>, must depend on formul&aelig; and <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>
<li>the union of the Gospel with the Greek spirit (a) due to the conquests of Alexander and the consequent mingling of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>, (b) further strengthened about A.D. 130, when Greek <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converts</a> brought into Christianity the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in which they were <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, (c) again, about a century later, when Greek mysteries and Greek civilization in its widest range were admitted, and finally, (d) about the middle of the fourth century, when the Greek spirit finally prevailed and <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> and mythology (i.e. the <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">worship</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>) were admitted
<li>the internal struggles with <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, which aimed at a synthesis of all existing <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creeds</a>. "The struggle with <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> compelled the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to put its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">teaching</a>, its worship, and its <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> into fixed forms and ordinances, and to exclude everyone who would not yield them obedience" (Das Wesen des Christenthums, Lect. Xi, p. 210).
</ul>

<p>It is the second of these reasons for the birth and growth of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> that concerns us immediately; but we may remark in regard to the first that it ignores the direct working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, the perpetual renewal of fervour through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the use of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, that have always marked the course of Christianity. Herein, the spirit of its first days is seen still to be energetic, notwithstanding the comparative elaborateness of <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a> and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">ritual</a> of modern Christianity. The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are admitted to be the most <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> exponents of practical Christianity; they are not exceptions or accidents or by-products of the system; yet they did not find <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> any hindrance to their <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>As regards the third <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> above mentioned, we may grant that it has always been the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> function of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to bring about a clearer definition of the Christian <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> in its many varieties undoubtedly had this effect. But long before <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> had sufficiently developed to necessitate the safeguarding of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> by <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">definition</a>, we find traces of an organized <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with a very definite <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a>. Not to mention the traditional "for of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>" spoken of by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#vrs17">Romans 6:17</a>) and the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> required by Philip from the eunuch (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs37">Acts 8:37</a>), many critics, including the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> Zahn and Kattenbusch (Das Apostolische Symbol., Leipzig, 1894-1900), agree that the present <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> represents a formula which took shape in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age and was uninfluenced by <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, which Protean <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> first became formidable about A.D. 130. And as regards <a href="../cathen/07326a.htm">organization</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the episcopate was a fully recognized institution in the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> (c. 110), whilst the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">Canon of New Testament Scripture</a>, the final establishment of which was undoubtedly helped by <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, was in process of recognition even in <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> times. St. Peter (assuming the <a href="../bible/2pe000.htm">Second epistle</a> to be his) classifies <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> with the "other <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>" (<a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#vrs16">2 Peter 3:16</a>), and <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a>, early in the second century, quotes as <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> nine of those thirteen <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Pauline</a> documents.

<p>Concerning the "union of the Gospel with the Greek spirit" which, according to Hatch and Harnack, resulted in such profound modification so the former, we may admit many of the statements made, without drawing from them the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> inferences. We readily grant that Greek thought and Greek culture had thoroughly permeated the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> into which Christianity was born. Alexander's conquests had brought about a diffusion of Greek ideals throughout the East. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were dispersed westwards, both from Palestine and from the towns of the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">Captivity</a>, and established in colonies in the chief cities of the empire, especially in <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. The extent of this dispersion may be gathered from <a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs9">Acts 2:9-11</a>), Greek became the language of commerce and social intercourse, and Palestine itself, more particularly <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, was to a great extent hellenized. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> were best known in a Greek version, and the last additions to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> &mdash; the <a href="../cathen/15666a.htm">Book of Wisdom</a> and the <a href="../bible/2ma000.htm">Second Book of Machabees</a> &mdash; were entirely composed in that tongue. In addition to this peaceful permeation of the Hebraic by the Greek genius, formal efforts were made from time to time, both in the political and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> sphere to hellenize the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> altogether.

<p>It is with the latter attempt that we are concerned; for the writings of <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, its chief and earliest advocate, coincided with the birth of Christianity. <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> was a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, well versed in Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and literature, and at the same time a devout believer in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. The general purpose of his principal writings was to show that the admirable wisdom of the Greeks was contained in substance in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Jewish Scriptures</a>, and his method was to read allegory into the simple narratives of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. To the pure and <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> he wedded various <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> taken from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, trying thus to solve the problem, with which all <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is ultimately confronted, how to bridge the gulf between <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and the finite, the absolute and the conditioned. Philo's writings were, no doubt, widely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> amongst the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, both at home and abroad, at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> began to preach, but it is extremely unlikely that the latter, who were not <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> men, were acquainted with them.

<p>Not until the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and the beginning of his apostolate can Christianity be said to have come, in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of one of its chief exponents, into immediate contact with Greek religious and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> theories. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> was learned, not only in Hebrew, but also in Hellenistic lore, and a singularly apt instrument in the design of Providence, on account of his <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> origin and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, his Greek learning, and his Roman citizenship, to aid Christianity to throw off the swaddling-bands of its infancy and go forth to the conquest of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>.

<p>But whilst recognizing this <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> in the election of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, we cannot, in face of his own express and emphatic testimony, go on to assert that he universalized Christianity, as <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> attempted to universalize <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, by adding to its <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> content the merely natural religion of the Greek thinkers of his own more sublime and pure conceptions. In one of his earliest letters, the <a href="../bible/1co000.htm">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> rebukes their factious spirit, whereby some of them had styled themselves partisans of Apollos, a learned Alexandrian, and repudiates again and again that very attempt to make Christianity plausible by tricking it out in the garb of current speculations. "But we preach <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> crucified, unto the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> indeed a stumbling-block, and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> foolishness" (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs23">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; see chaps. <a href="../bible/1co001.htm">1</a> and <a href="../bible/1co002.htm">2</a>, and <a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs8">Colossians 2:8</a>). <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, at any rate, was not indebted for his <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> to <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> or his school, and any similarity of terminology which may occur in the works of the two authors may quite reasonably be ascribed to the metaphors already embodied in the language they both used.

<p>More insistence has been laid, perhaps, on the resemblance between the <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> set forth by St. John in the opening chapters of his <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/01594b.htm">Apocalypse</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> theories which <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> elaborated, and which he is said to have taken from Greek sources. If he did so, we may remark, he neglected others older and nearer to hand, for the conception of a Divine Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">Deity</a> enters into <a href="../cathen/06614a.htm">relation with the created universe</a>, is by no means exclusively or originally Greek. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, expressed in the <a href="../bible/gen001.htm">opening verses of Genesis</a>, is frequently repeated in the rest of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (see <a href="../bible/psa032.htm#vrs6">Psalms 32:6</a>; <a href="../bible/psa147.htm#vrs15">147:15</a>; <a href="../bible/pro008.htm#vrs22">Proverbs 8:22</a>; <a href="../bible/wis007.htm#vrs24">Wisdom 7:24-30</a>, etc.). <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, therefore, was not compelled to seek in the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> Nous, which is merely the directive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, as the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the foundation of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. His <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> theory is not at all clear or consistent, but, apparently, he conceives the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> to be a quasi-personal, subordinate, intermediate being between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the world, enabling the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a> to come into contact with <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>. He calls this <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> "the eldest" and the "first-born" <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, and uses phrases that suggest the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>; but there is no resemblance in substance between the bold, clear, categoric statements of the <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">inspired</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>, and the misty, if poetical, conceptions of the Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. We may conjecture that St. John chose his language so as to impress the cultivated Greek <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Divine Logos</a>, thus connecting his teaching with the older <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, and, at the same time, putting a check upon the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> to which Philoism was already giving birth.

<p>Abandoning the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age, Harnack, in his "History of Dogma", ascribes the hellenization of Christianity to the <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologists</a> of the second century (1st German edit., p. 253). This contention can best be refuted by showing that the essential doctrines of Christianity are contained already in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament Scriptures</a>, while giving, at the same time, their due force to the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">traditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">corporate Christianity</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> article by article from the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred records</a>, interpreted by the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> that preceded them and determined their canon, then the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a> assertion will have some support.

<p>But the point of comparison with the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> must be not only the Sermon on the Mount, as Hatch desires, nor the merely verbal teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but the whole <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> record. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> taught by His <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> no less than by His words, and it was His actions and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">sufferings</a> as well as His oral lessons that His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> preached. For the fuller exposition of this, see <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">REVELATION</a>. Here it suffices to note that Christian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> became, in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologists</a>, the synthesis of all speculative <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It met and conquered the various imperfect systems that possessed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> at its birth and arose after that event.

<p>The early <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> &mdash; <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, and the rest &mdash; were but attempts to make Christianity one of a number of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a>; the attempts failed, but the scattered <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a> contained were shown, as <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> went on, to exist and find their fulfilment in Christianity as well. "The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>", says <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>,

<blockquote><p>has been ever 'sitting in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, both hearing and asking them questions'; claiming to herself what they said rightly, correcting their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, supplying their defects, completing their beginnings, expanding their surmises, and thus gradually by means of them enlarging the range and refining the sense of her teaching. (Development of Doctrine, viii)</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same section <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> thus summarizes the battle and the triumph:

<blockquote><p>such was the conflict of Christianity with the old established <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a>, which was almost dead before Christianity appeared; with the Oriental Mysteries, flitting widely to and fro like spectres; with the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, who made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowledge</a> all in all, despised the many, and called <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> mere children in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">Truth</a>: with the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonists</a>, men of literature, pedants, visionaries, or courtiers; with the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichees</a>, who professed to seek <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>, not by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; with the fluctuating teachers of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Antioch, the time-serving Eusebians, and the reckless versatile <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>; with the fanatic <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> and harsh <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a>, who shrank from the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, without power to propagate their own. These <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> had no stay or consistence, yet they contained elements of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> amid their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and had Christianity been as they, it might have resolved into them; but it had that hold of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which gave its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">teaching</a> a gravity, a directness, a consistency, a sternness, and a force to which its rivals, for the most part, were strangers. (ibid., viii)</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="section2">The essentials of Christianity</h2>

<p>We have so far seen, in its origin and growth, the essential independence of Christianity of all other religious systems, except that of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, with which, however, its relation was merely that of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> to shadow. It is now time to point out its distinctive doctrines.

<p>In early Christianity there was much that was transitory and exceptional. It was not presented full-grown to the world, but left to develop in accordance with the forces and tendencies that were implanted in it from the first by its <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Founder</a>. And we, having His assurance that His Spirit would abide with it for all <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, to inspire and regulate its <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> elements, can see in its subsequent history the working out of His design. Hence, it does not trouble us to find in primitive Christianity qualities which did not survive after they had served their purpose. Natural causes and the course of events, always under the Divine guidance, resulted in Christianity taking on the form which would best secure its permanence and efficiency. In <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> times, supreme authority as to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> was vested in <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">twelve representatives of Christ</a>, each of whom was commissioned to proclaim and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibly</a> interpret His Gospel. The <a href="../cathen/07326a.htm">hierarchy</a> was in an inchoate <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. Special <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">charismata</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">tongues</a>, were bestowed on <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/07326a.htm">official teaching body</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was in process of organization, and the various Christian communities, united, doubtless, in a strong bond of charity, and in the sense that they had one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, were to a large extent independent of one another in the matter of government.

<p>Such was the fashion in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> allowed His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be established. It has greatly changed in outward appearances during the ages. Has there been any corresponding change in <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>? Are the <a href="../cathen/06319a.htm">essentials</a> of Christianity the same now as they were then? We affirm that they are, and we <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> our assertion by examining the main points of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">teaching</a>, both of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. We must look upon the matter as a whole. We cannot judge of Christianity properly before the coming of the Holy Spirit. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> describe a process which was not consummated till after Pentecost. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> themselves were not fully Christians till they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> all that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was &mdash; their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and their Redeemer as well as their Master. And as Christianity furnishes a regulative principle for both <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and will, teaching us what to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and what to do, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> no less than works must characterize the perfect Christian.
<h3 id="A">The teaching of Christ</h3>

<p>Taking, then, first of all, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> teaching, we may divide it into (a) what He did not reveal but only reaffirmed, (b) what He drew from obscurity, and (c) what He added to the sum total of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and practice.

<p>(a) The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, however worldly-minded, were at any rate free from their ancestral tendency to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. They were strict <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheists</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in the unity, power, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Supreme Deity</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> reaffirmed, purified, and confirmed the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, both <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> and <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a>. He asserted the spiritual <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs18">John 1:18</a>; <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#vrs24">4:24</a>), and insisted on the importance of <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worshipping</a> Him in <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, i.e. with more than merely external <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. And he exacted the same right <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">dispositions of heart</a> in the whole of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service, showing how both guilt and <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> depend on the will and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs28">Matthew 5:28</a>; <a href="../bible/mat015.htm#vrs18">15:18</a>). He recalled the original unity and indissolubility of the marriage-tie. He brought into prominence the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and hence the transcendent importance, of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs26">Matthew 16:26</a>), as against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> and the worldliness of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in general. In all these points He fulfilled the Law by showing its real and full significance.

<p>(b) But He did not stop here. Taking the great central precept of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Dispensation</a> &mdash; the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &mdash; He pointed out all its implications and made clear that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Fatherhood of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so imperfectly grasped under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, was the immediate source of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the brotherhood of men, which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had never realized at all. He never tired of dwelling on the loving kindness and the tender <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of His Father, and He insisted equally on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loving</a> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, summing up the whole of His <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> teaching in the observance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs43">Matthew 5:43</a>; <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs40">22:40</a>). This universal charity He designed to be the mark of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> followers (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs45">John 13:45</a>), and in it, therefore, we must see the genuine Christian spirit, so distinct from everything that had hitherto been seen on earth that the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precept</a> which inspired it He called "new" (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs34">John 13:34</a>). <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> clear and definite teaching, moreover, about the life to come, the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">final judgment</a> resulting in an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">happiness</a> or <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">misery</a>, the strict responsibility which attaches to the smallest human actions, is in great contrast to the current <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatology</a>. By substituting <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> sanctions for earthly rewards and punishments, He raised and ennobled the motives for the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and set before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ambition an object wholly worthy of the <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">adopted</a> sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the extension of their Father's Kingdom in their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of others.

<p>(c) Among the doctrines added by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish faith</a>, the chief, of course, are those concerning Himself, including the central <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the whole Christian system, the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation of God the Son</a>. In regard to Himself, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> made two claims, though not with equal insistence. He asserted that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the expected of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, Whose mission it was to undo the effects of the Fall and to reconcile <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and He claimed to be Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, equal to, and one with, the Father. In support of this double claim, He pointed to the fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecies</a>, and He worked many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. His claim to be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> was not admitted by the leaders of His nation; had it been admitted, He would doubtless have manifested His Divinity more clearly. Most modern <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> (Harnack, Wellhausen, and others) acknowledge that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from the beginning of His preaching <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Himself as the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, and accepted the various titles which belong in the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> to that personage &mdash; Son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> (<a href="../bible/dan007.htm#vrs13">Daniel 7:13</a>), the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (see <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs24">John 14:24</a>; <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs16">Matthew 16:16</a>; <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs61">Mark 14:61-62</a>). In one passage &mdash; and very significant one &mdash; He applies the name to Himself &mdash; "But this is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life: That they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> thee, the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom thou hast sent" (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#vrs3">John 17:3</a>).

<p>In regard to His Divinity, His claim is clear, but not emphasized. We cannot say that the title <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">"Son of God"</a>, which is repeatedly given to Him in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs34">John 1:34</a>; <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs40">Matthew 27:40</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs12">Mark 3:12</a>; <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs39">15:39</a>, etc.), and which He is described as taking to Himself (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs43">Matthew 27:43</a>; <a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs36">John 10:36</a>), necessarily of itself connotes a Divine <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>; and in the mouths of several of the speakers, e.g. in the exclamation of <a href="../cathen/10711b.htm">Nathaniel</a>, "<a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbi</a>, Thou art the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>", it presumably does not. But in the confession of St. Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs16">Matthew 16:16</a>) the circumstances point to more than a mere amplification of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> title. That title was at that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in habitual use in regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and there would have been nothing significant in <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter's</a> expression and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> glad acceptance of it, if it had not gone further than the common <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> hailed St. Peter's confession as a special <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, not as a mere <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduction</a> from external facts. When we compare this with that other declaration narrated in the same Gospel (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs62">Matthew 26:62-66</a>), where, in answer to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuration</a>, 'I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> thee by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>, that thou tell us if thou be the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>", <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> replied, "Thou has said it" (i.e., "I am"; see <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs62">Mark 14:62</a>), we cannot reasonably <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> claimed to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Divine</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> so understood this and put Him to death as a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemer</a>.

<p>Another prominent feature in the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> about the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>. When, in <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John's</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs16">14:16-17</a>), He says; "And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>, that he may abide with you forever, the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>", it is impossible to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that what He promises is a mere abstraction, not a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> like Himself. In <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs26">verse 26</a>, the personality is still more marked: "And the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whom the Father shall send in my name, He will teach you all things". (Cf. <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs26">15:26</a>, "But when the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> shall come whom I shall send you from the Father, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">Truth</a> who proceeds from the Father" etc.) It may be that the full meaning of those words was not realized till the Spirit did actually come; moreover, the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> was made, of course, only to His immediate followers; still, no unbiased <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> can deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> here speaks of a personal influence as a distinct Divine entity; a distinction and a Divinity which is further implied in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> formula He afterwards instituted (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs19">Matthew 28:19</a>).

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> took up the burden of the preaching of His <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">precursor</a> and proclaimed the advent of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a>, a conception already familiar in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> [<a href="../bible/psa144.htm#vrs11">Psalm 144:11-13</a>], but furnished with a wider and more varied content in the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. It may be taken to mean, according to the context, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic Kingdom</a> in its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> spiritual sense, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> came to found, wherein to store up and perpetuate the benefits of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> (cf. The <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> of the wheat and the tares, the dragnet, and the wedding feast), or the reign of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the heart that submits to His sovereignty (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#vrs21">Luke 16:21</a>), or the abode of the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs20">Matthew 5:20</a> etc.). It was the main topic of His preaching, which was occupied in showing what dispositions of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and heart and will, were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for entrance into "the Kingdom", what, in other words, was the Christian ideal. Regarded as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, He preached the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom</a> to the multitude in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> only, reserving fuller explanations to private intercourse with His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs3">Acts 1:3</a>).

<p>The last great <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> which we learn from the <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, preaching, and death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>. "For the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> also came not to be ministered unto but to minister, and to give His <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> a <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> for many" (<a href="../bible/mar010.htm#vrs45">Mark 10:45</a>). The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificial</a> character of His death is clearly stated at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>: "This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs28">Matthew 26:28</a>). And He ordained the perpetuation of that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">Sacrifice</a> by His Disciples in the words: "Do this in commemoration of me" (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs19">Luke 22:19</a>). <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, knowing the counsels of His Father, deliberately set Himself to realize in His own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the portrait of the suffering servant of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jahveh</a>, so vividly <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm">chapter 53</a>), a <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> Who should triumph through death and defeat. This was a strange <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and the world. What wonder that so novel an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> could not enter the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles'</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> till it had actually been realized and further explained by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Victim</a> himself (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs27">Luke 24:27, 45</a>). Thus, first of all in action, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> preached the great <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Atonement, and, by raising Himself from the dead, He added another <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to those establishing His Divine mission and His Divine <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. But, naturally enough, He left the more explicit teaching on these points to His chosen <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, whose presentment of Christianity we shall presently examine.

<p>To turn now to what is new in the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> teachings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we may say, once for all, that it embodied <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> perfection. There may be development of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, but, after the Sermon on the Mount, there can be no further evolution of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> own perfection is set as the standard (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs48">Matthew 5:48</a>). <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">Duty</a> was the principal motive in the Old Dispensation; in the New this was sublimated into <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Men</a> were taught to serve not on account of the penal ties attached to non-service, but on principles of generosity. Before, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will was to be the aim of the creature's performance; now, His good pleasure also was to be sought. "What things are pleasing to Him, these do I always" (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#vrs29">John 8:29</a>), and by action even more than by word <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> taught the lesson of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> self-sacrifice. Never till His <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> were the Evangelical counsels &mdash; voluntary poverty, perpetual <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and entire obedience &mdash; preached or practised. From no previous <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> code, however, exalted, could the <a href="../cathen/02371a.htm">Beatitudes</a> have been evolved. Meekness and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> were unknown as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and despised by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> made them the ground-work of the whole <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> edifice. To realize what new thing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> teaching brought into the world and put within the grasp of everyone, we have only to think of the great host of the Christian <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. For they are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Cross, those who imbibed and expressed His spirit best, who had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to test the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of that Divine paradox which forms the substance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> message; "He that shall wish to save his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall lose it, but he that shall lose his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on my account shall find it" (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs25">Matthew 16:25</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/mar008.htm#vrs35">Mark 8:35</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs24">Luke 9:24</a>; <a href="../bible/luk017.htm#vrs33">17:33</a>; <a href="../bible/joh012.htm#vrs25">John 12:25</a>). That was the course He Himself adopted &mdash; the way of the Cross &mdash; and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were not above their Master.  Self-conquest as a preliminary to conquering the world of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &mdash; that was the lesson taught by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, and still more by His passion and death.
<h3 id="B">The teaching of the Apostles</h3>

<p>Does the Christianity presented to us in the rest of the writings of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> differ from that described in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>? And if so, is the difference one of kind or one of degree? We have seen that Christianity must not be judged in the making, but as a finished product. It was never meant to be fully set forth in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, where it is presented mainly in action. "I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now", said <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His last discourse. "But when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will teach you all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> . . . and the things that are to come he shall show you" (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs12">John 16:12, 13</a>). We may presume that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself told them these many things when "He showed himself alive after his passion, by many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, for forty days appearing to them, and speaking of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs3">Acts 1:3</a>), and that they were rendered permanent in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> by the indwelling of the Spirit of Truth after Pentecost. Accordingly, we must expect to find in their teaching a more formal, more theoretic, and more <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> exposition of Christianity than in the drama of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. But what we have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to expect, and what <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> always do expect, is to find the whole of Christianity in its written records. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> nowhere prescribed writing as a means of promulgating His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>. It was comparatively late in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age, and apparently in obedience to no preconceived plan, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred books</a> began to appear. Many Christians must have lived and died before those books existed, or without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them. And so we cannot argue from the non-appearance of any particular tenet to its non-existence, nor from its first mention to its first invention &mdash; fallacies which often vitiate the erudite researches of the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a>.

<p>The main heads of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> preaching, as far as we can gather from the records, vary with the <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of the audiences they addressed. To the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> they dwelt upon the marvellous fulfilment of the prophesies in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, showing that, in spite of the manner of His <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and death, He was actually the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, and that their <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had really been accomplished by His sacrifice on the Cross. This was the burden of St. Peter's discourses (<a href="../bible/act002.htm">Acts 2</a> and <a href="../bible/act003.htm">3</a>) and those of <a href="../cathen/14287a.htm">St. Stephen</a> and all who addressed the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/act026.htm#vrs22">Acts 26:22-23</a>). Once convinced of the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mission and the seal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> set upon it by His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, they were received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian body</a> to discover more at leisure all the implications of their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. In regard to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the same striking fact of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> was in the forefront of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> teaching, but more stress was laid upon the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Still, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, whose peculiar mission it was to approve the new <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> to those that sat in darkness and had no common ground of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, did not consider that his Gospel was anything different from that of the others. "I have laboured more abundantly than all they: yet not I, but the <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">grace of God</a> with me: for, <em>whether I, or they</em>, so we preach, and you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs10">1 Corinthians 15:10-11</a>).

<p>This definiteness and uniformity of content in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> message, and this sense of responsibility in regard to its <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>, is still more strikingly emphasized by the same <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> in the <a href="../bible/gal000.htm">next Epistle</a>, wherein, rebuking the <a href="../cathen/06336a.htm">Galatians</a> for giving heed to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">innovators</a> "who would pervert the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel of Christ</a>", he exclaims: 'Yet, though we ourselves or an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> preach a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a> other than that we have preached to you, let him be <a href="../cathen/09569a.htm">accursed</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs7">Galatians 1:7, 8</a>). There is no trace here of uncertainty or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> as to what Christianity meant, or of any tentative groping in search of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Even then, when <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a> was in its infancy, we find the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> exhorting <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">Timothy</a> to keep to the very phrases in which he has received the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, "the form of sound words", avoiding "profane novelties of expression" (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#vrs20">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs13">2 Timothy 1:13</a>). Once again "Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">traditions</a> which you have learned, whether by word or by our <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">epistle</a>" (<a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs14">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>). And those <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">traditions</a> were directly communicated by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a>, as he tells us in many passages &mdash; "For I have received of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> that which also I delivered unto you" (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs23">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>), and again "For I delivered unto you first of all what I received" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs3">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>).

<p>Many <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> have professed to discover in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">apostolic writings</a> various kinds of Christianity mutually antagonistic and all alike illegitimate developments of the original Gospel. We have <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Pauline</a>, Petrine, <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">Joannine</a> Christianity, as distinguished from the Christianity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But those theories which ignore <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> guidance, and rest on the <a href="../bible/index.html">written records</a> alone, are gradually being abandoned, helped to their disappearance by the critics themselves, who have little respect for each others' hypotheses. We may take the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> messages as one self-consistent whole, any apparent discrepancies or want of coherence being amply accounted for by the different circumstances of their deliverance.

<p>This preaching, therefore, reduced to its simplest form, was: The <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His Divinity and <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, a guarantee of His teaching and a pledge of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.

<p>On the historic fact of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> the whole of Christianity is based. If He was not truly slain, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cannot have been <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; if he did not <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise again</a>, He cannot have been <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> does not hesitate to stake everything on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this fact: If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be not <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">risen again</a>, then is our preaching vain, and your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also is vain. Yea, and we are found <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs14">1 Corinthians 15:14-15</a>). Consequently, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's providence</a> has so arranged matters that the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Christ's Resurrection</a> place the fact beyond all reasonable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>.

<p>But if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is so emphatic about the foundation of the Christian <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, he is also careful to erect the edifice upon it. It is to him that we owe the statement of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of grace, that wonderful <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a> to <a href="../cathen/12714a.htm">regenerate</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had already taught, in the allegory of the vine and the branches (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs1">John 15:1-17</a>), that there can be no salutary action on the part of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> without vital communication with Him. This great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is expanded in many passages by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs13">Philippians 2:13</a>; <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs9">Romans 8:9-11</a>; <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs10">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#vrs5">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>; <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs5">Galatians 4:5-</a>6) wherein <a href="../cathen/12714a.htm">regenerate</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> learns that he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> adopted son and united with Him by the indwelling of His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. This <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a> is what <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> gains by <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Christ's redemption</a>, the benefits of which are applied to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is not only the chief exponent of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, but he alone of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> promulgates anew the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Blessed Eucharist, the principal fountain of grace (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs23">1 Corinthians 11:23, 24</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#vrs13">John 4:13-14</a>).

<p>We need not pursue farther the development of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> amongst the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The Christianity they preached was received from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, and His Spirit prevented them from misconceiving or misinterpreting it. On the strength of His commission they insisted on the obedience of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denounced</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and with skill, incredible had it not been Divine, they preserved the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> committed to them in the midst of a perverse, subtle and corrupt civilization. That same Divine skill has remained with Christianity ever since; <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> after <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has attacked the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and been defeated, leaving the fortress all the more impregnable for its onset. The Christianity we profess today is the Christianity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Just as they were more explicit than He in its verbal formulation, so the <a href="../cathen/01634a.htm">Apostolic Church</a> has ever since laboured to express more and more clearly the treasures of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> originally committed to her charge. In a sense, we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> more than our first Christian ancestors, inasmuch as we have a more complete <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the contents of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; in a sense, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> all that we do, for they accepted as we the principle of a Divinely-commissioned teaching authority, to whose <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> utterances they were ever prepared to give assent. The same essential oneness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the same variety in its content for the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> exist side by side in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> today. The trained <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, deeply versed in the wonders of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, and the young or the uneducated who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> explicitly little more than the bare essentials of Christianity, knowing the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">One True God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> whom He hath sent, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, the Atonement, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are equally Christians, equally possessed of the integrity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
<h2 id="section3">The divine purpose in Christianity</h2>

<p>It remains now to set forth, as far as we can determine it from the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred records</a> and from the course of history itself, the purpose of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in establishing Christianity. We gather that the Divine founder meant Christianity to be (1) a universal religion, (2) a perfect religion, (3) a visibly organized religion.
<h3 id="A">Universality includes both space and time</h3>

<p>As regards <a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">space</a>, we see that Christianity is intended for the whole world

<ul>
<li>from the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecies</a> that foreshadowed it in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Among these were the promises made to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and his descendants, the constantly recurring note of which is that in them "all the nations of the earth shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a>".
<li>From the plainly expressed purpose of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, who, while proclaiming that His personal mission concerned only the "lost sheep of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">House of Israel</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm#vrs24">Matthew 15:24</a>), announced the future extension of His <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom</a>: "Other sheep I have who are not of this fold" (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs16">John 10:16</a>); "Many from the east and the west shall come and shall recline with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs11">Matthew 8:11</a>); "And this Gospel of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom</a> shall be preached throughout the whole world in testimony to all <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs19">Matthew 28:19</a>).
<li>From the actual conduct of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, who, though they required the special inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to bring home to them the practical bearing of this commission, did finally leave the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> and proclaim the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> to all without distinction of race or country.</ul>

<p>The universality of Christianity, in <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">space</a>, is implied in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise, "Behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world" (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs20">Matthew 28:20</a>). It follows, furthermore, from the next element in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> purpose to be considered.
<h3 id="B">Christianity is meant to be a perfect religion</h3>

<p>A priori, we should expect that a religious system which was revealed and instituted, not by a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or even an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but by the personal action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, and was designed, moreover, to supplant an imperfect and provisional form of religion, would lack nothing of possible perfection in end or means. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own teaching satisfied this expectation, and precludes the notion entertained by some early <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and still alive in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of a fuller and more perfect <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> to come.

<ul>
<li>First of all, He, its Founder, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore had all the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and all the power requisite to establish a perfect religion.
<li>Secondly, He promised His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> the abiding presence of the Spirit of Truth, who should teach them <em>all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em>.
<li>Thirdly, He promised that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">body</a> enshrining this deposit should never be vitiated by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> &mdash; "The gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it" (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs18">Matthew 16:18</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#vrs27">Ephesians 5:27</a>).
<li>Fourthly, the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is insinuated by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> words: "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who at sundry times . . .<em>last of all</em> . . .hath spoken to us by His Son" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs1">Hebrews 1:1</a>), and by the expression, <em>the fulness of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a></em>, used in <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs4">Galatians 4:4</a>, to indicate the epoch of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>.
<li>Fifthly, by the <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of the Christian <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> itself and the Christian <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> ideal which is the imitation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Perfect Being. No possible development of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> can be thought of which should not find all that it needs in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</ul>

<p>We are compelled, therefore, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Christian <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> closed with the death of the last of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">those originally commissioned to set it forth</a>. We are thus brought counter to a modern view regarding <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> which has lately been condemned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (Encyclical, "Pascendi Gregis", Sept., 1907). It is to the effect that <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is nothing external, but a clearer and closer apprehension of things Divine by the Christian <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a>, which in each particular age is the expression of the experience of the best men of that age. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> grows, like a material organism, by waste and renewed supply, and therefore what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for one age maybe quite different from what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for another. The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which has these developments is ultimately <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, being based on the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> assumption that the finite <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only the phenomenal and can have no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of what is beyond experience. Were that so, any external <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> would be impossible, for its guarantees &mdash; <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> &mdash; could not be grasped by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intelligence</a>. These <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> were long ago exposed and condemned by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. The most casual glance at the history of Christianity shows that there has been development of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">Creed</a> grew only gradually; but that development is merely <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, produced by <a href="../cathen/01450a.htm">analysis</a> of the content of the original deposit. (See DEVELOPMENT OF DOCTRINE.)
<h3 id="C">God intended, in the third place, that Christianity should be a visible organization</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> established a <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and, in a variety of <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, sketched many of the features of its character and history, all of which point to something external and perceptible by the senses. It is the "house built upon a rock" (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#vrs24">Matthew 7:24</a>), showing the security and permanence of its foundation, and "the city set upon a hill" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs14">Matthew 5:14</a>) indicating its visibility. Its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> works in the three great races descended from <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noe's</a> sons like the leaven hidden in three measures of meal, silently, irresistibly (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs33">Matthew 13:33</a>). It grows great from humble beginnings, like the mustard seed (<a href="../bible/luk013.htm#vrs19">Luke 13:19</a>). It is a vineyard, a sheep-fold, and finally a kingdom, all of which images are unintelligible if the bond that unites Christians is merely the invisible bond of charity.

<p>The old distinction between the body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is useful to prevent confusion of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Christian <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> constitutes membership in the Visible <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the state of grace, membership in the Invisible. It is obvious that one membership does not necessarily connote the other. Some of these <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> apply only to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> fully developed, and so they indicate <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> ultimate purpose. History shows us that, in establishing Christianity as an institution, He was content that on its human side its organization should be subject to the same <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of growth and development as other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> institutions. He did not give His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> a draft scheme of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> constitution beforehand, to be worked out in the course of ages, prescribing the various stages of progress, and indicating the final term. But the organization which existed in germ in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> was left to unfold itself under the guidance of the abiding Spirit, according to the needs of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and place. The presence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a> sufficiently guarantee that the result, however obtained, is in accordance with the original design. It may well be that the development was very largely natural, modelled, first of all, on the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and then on the existing <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil government</a>; its progress may have been hastened or retarded by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but any account of it that ignores the directing finger of Providence cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

<p>This, then, is Christianity, a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> religion and the only absolute one; in a sense (developed in the <a href="../cathen/07181a.htm">Epistle to the Hebrews</a>), the oldest, for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not an afterthought, but instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the fullness of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and containing a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of Himself, which all to whom it has been adequately presented are bound under pain of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal loss</a> to accept (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs16">Mark 16:16</a>), offering to all, who are sincere in seeking, the solution of all the world's problems; enabling <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to rise to the sublimest heights and "to play the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>"; full itself of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and Divine paradoxes, as bringing the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">Infinite</a> into contact with the finite; the one bond of civilization, the one condition of progress, the one <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">humanity</a>. Its fortunes have been the fortunes of its <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Founder</a>; "not all <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospel</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#vrs16">Romans 10:16</a>). The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> rejected <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in spite of the evidence of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>; the world rejects the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of Christ</a>, the "city set upon a hill", conspicuous though she be through the notes that proclaim her Divine. What <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> call the failure of Christianity is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that it is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> final <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. It only makes evident how real is human <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">liberty</a> and how grave human responsibility. Christianity is furnished with all the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> evidence to create conviction of its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, given goodwill. &mdash; "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear".
