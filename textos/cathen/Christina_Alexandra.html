<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Christina Alexandra</h1>  

<p>Queen of Sweden, child of Gustavus Adolphhus II of Sweden, born at <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a>, 8 December, 1626; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 19 April, 1689. Her father (d. 1632) was the famous soldier whose interposition in the Thirty Years' Was wrought so much harm to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, her mother, had hoped for a son, and was so disappointed at the birth of a daughter that she had little <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the child, who was left to the care of nurses. Gustavus Adolphus, however, was tenderly attached to his daughter; in 1630, when he sailed for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he recommended Christina to the loyalty of his people and put his sister Catherine, who held her court at Stegeborg, in charge of the child's <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Three years later, Maria Eleonora brought back the body of her husband, Gustavus Adolphus, to Sweden. For a while after this her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> seemed to be transferred to the child, but this affectionate relation did not last long. In obedience to the command of her father, Christina was brought up like a boy, and received instruction in the various branches of learning from distinguished men, among whom was the learned Dr. Matthi&aelig;, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Streng&egrave;s. The princess was an indefatigable student, and a great reader of good books. Feminine occupations and amusements had no attraction for her, and she was indifferent to dress and finery of all kinds. The mother wished rather to see he daughter lead a life of pleasure, and encouraged her in the enjoyment of wine and other stimulating drinks, so that the country was alarmed for the morals of the heir to the throne, and Christina was sent again to her aunt. When the aunt died she was put under the care of the sister of the celebrated chancellor Axel Oxenstiern. In her new surroundings the great talents of Christina rapidly developed. She soon mastered several languages, gained a comprehensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of history and politics, and showed in particular a strong liking for theologico-political speculations. At the same time the masculine qualities of her character grew steadily more evident. Her favorite amusement was bear-hunting, and she could outride most men. At 18 (8 December, 1644) she was of age and entered on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of government with a strong hand. It was not, however, until two years later she was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> taking place with great pomp at <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a>.

<p>At first Christina devoted herself to the affairs of state with most laudable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. It was owing to her interventions that the peace negotiations at M&uuml;nster and Osnabr&uuml;ck were more quickly concluded than expected. Christina strove to raise her people to a higher plane of civilization, to promote their welfare in every way, and to insure their prosperity. Without lowering the dignity suitable to her station she treated all her subjects with dignity and condescension. She drew to Sweden artists and scholars, among whom were the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> and Hugo Grotius, the expounder of <a href="../cathen/09073a.htm">international law</a>; by the payment of large pensions she kept these men attached to her court. The praise with which these scholars repaid their royal patron was often immoderate. As time went on Christina gradually lost interest in the task of government and developed an intense desire for new and exciting pleasures, often for those of a most costly character. The health of the queen suffered from the changed method of her life, and it was with great difficulty that her French physician, Dr. Bourdelot, effected a cure. On the mean time the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> thus incurred rose to a large amount. The <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> people wished the queen to marry and to give them an heir to the throne, but Christina was not willing to hear of this as she desired to preserve her personal independence. She was much more inclined to abdicate her position and to become a ruler in the realm of genius and learning. At the same time she showed a continually growing inclination to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for she took no pleasure in the simple forms of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> which was all-powerful in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. It is not possible to prove positive whether Dr. Bourdelot or the Spanish ambassador, Pimentelli, influence Christina's change of religious views. It is certain however, that several members of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, Fathers Macedo, Francken, Malines, and Casati, succeeded in removing her last <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Christina perceived that she could not continue to reign in Sweden as a convert to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and resigned her throne in favour of her cousin, Charles Gustavus of Pfalz-Zweibr&uuml;cken, a member of the Wittelsbach <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. On 6 June, 1654, at <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a>, she transferred her authority to him with much <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, and in the following day started on her travels. She bade farewell to her mother at Nyk&ouml;ping, then hastened to Halmstad, where she dismissed her retinue, and went to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> and <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. At <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> she made private confession of her <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; her public entrance into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> took place in the beginning of November 1655, in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Innsbruck.

<p>It was from Innsbruck that the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Courts were officially informed of her change of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On 23 December, she reached the capital of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, which was decorated in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> came personally to meet her, administered the sacrament of Confirmation, and added Alexandra to her name. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Christina's home was in the Palazzo Farnese; during her residence here she sought to satisfy her <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> ambitions as well as the longings of her devout and loving heart. She visited the sacred places to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, went as a ministering angel into the hovels of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and devoted herself to the study of the collections of art and the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>. She drew into the circle of her fascinations the leading <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, arranged concerts and plays, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to delight everyone by her acuteness and learning. She was not willing, however, to drop rough <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> customs, and allowed herself to display various peculiarities of dress and manner, so that many people avoided her. In 1656 and 1657, Christina went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the first time with a retinue, the second time incognito. On the latter trip her conduct excited much displeasure as, among other eccentricities she dressed as a man. Much more severe censure was aroused by the trial, without proper legal forms, of an old servant, Monaldeschi, and his subsequent execution, although as sovereign she had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to pronounce sentence of <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, or at least believed herself entitled to this authority. Returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> she gradually fell under the displeasure of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, for like a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> daughter of Gustavus Adolphus she at times defied foreign <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and customs in too arrogant a fashion. Christina suffered much annoyance from the failure to receive with regularity from <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> the income to which she was entitled; sometimes no money came at all. Moreover a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> so active intellectually had not taste or time for keeping accounts. Dishonesty in the management of her money affairs naturally followed, and the disorder in her finances were not overcome until the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> through Cardinal Azzolini provided her with a competent bookkeeper.

<p>After the death of Charles Gustavus (1660) she returned to Sweden to have her <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> again legally confirmed. A second visit home (1667) was not of long duration as, in the pettiest manner, difficulties were thrown in the way of her exercise of her religion. After this for a time she lived in <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, but she made her continued stay in that city, then very rigidly <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, impossible by organizing festivities in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the newly-elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, which ended in tumult and bloodshed. In 1668 she returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and never again left the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>. Her new home was the Palazzo Riario, and she filled her residence with great collections of books and objects of art. Her palace became a centre both for the learned world and for artists and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>; to the latter, Christina gave both aid and generously paid commissions. Her forethought and care were not limited to her acquaintances and members of her household, the poor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> also found in her a charitable mother. As she grew older she fulfilled her religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> with increasing intelligence and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and the approach of her death had no longer any terrors for her. Piously and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> she prepared herself for the end; after arranging her worldly affairs she received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> devotion and died a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> child of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Against her express wishes the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had her body embalmed and brought to St. Peter's where it was buried under the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>. Her ostentatious but not prepossessing monument is the work of Carlo Fontana. Christina made Cardinal Azzolini her principal heir, while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> See and various <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereigns also received legacies. Unfortunately, after the death of Azzolini much of her valuable art collection passed into the hands of strangers; the greater part of her very rich <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, however, is in the Vatican. Pictures and plastic art of various kinds have preserved the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Christina's features. Although not beautiful, in her youth her appearance must have been interesting. In later years she grew too stout to retain any trace of good looks. Only the flashing, piercing eyes give any evidence of the fiery spirit which the exterior concealed. The character the northern sovereign remained very much the same through life. Receptive for everything good and great, she unfalteringly pursued her quest after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and after many wanderings found it in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. She had a tender, sympathetic heart, yet was subject at times to fits of temper, even cruelty. She was no saint, but was probably better than the members of her former confession pictured her. Any objective portrait of her will always bear out the judgment of Axel Oxenstiern, "After all she was the daughter of the Great Adolphus", both in her faults and in her virtues.
