<h1>Christology</h1>  

<p>Christology is that part of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> which deals with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. In its full extent it comprises the doctrines concerning both the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Christ and His works; but in the present article we shall limit ourselves to a consideration of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Here again we shall not infringe on the domain of the historian and <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, who present their respective contributions under the headings <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">JESUS CHRIST</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">MESSIAS</a>; hence the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, considered in the light of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> or from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> point of view, is the proper subject of the present article.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the Second Person of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Most Holy Trinity</a>, the Son or the Word of the Father, Who "was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary and was made man." These mysteries, though foretold in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, were fully revealed in the New, and clearly developed in <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian Tradition</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Hence we shall have to study our subject under the triple aspect of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian Tradition</a>.
<h2>Old Testament</h2>

<p>From what has been said we understand that the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is not considered here from the viewpoint of the Jewish scribe, but of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Himself was the first to use it in this way by His repeated appeal to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> passages of the prophetic writings. The Apostles saw in these prophecies many arguments in favour of the claims and the teachings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, too, are familiar with them, though they appeal less frequently to them than the patristic writers do. Even the Fathers either state the prophetic argument only in general terms or they quote single prophecies; but they thus prepare the way for the deeper insight into the historical perspective of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> predictions which began to prevail in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Leaving the statement of the historical development of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> prophecies to the writer of the article <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">MESSIAS</a>, we shall briefly call attention to the prophetic predictions of the genealogy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of His birth, His infancy, His names, His offices, His public life, His sufferings, and His glory.

<p>(1) References to the human genealogy of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> are quite numerous in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>: He is represented as the seed of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the son of Sem, the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, the prince of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, the offspring of the marrow of the high <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedar</a> (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs1">Genesis 3:1-19</a>; <a href="../bible/gen009.htm#vrs18">9:18-27</a>; <a href="../bible/gen012.htm#vrs1">12:1-9</a>; <a href="../bible/gen017.htm#vrs1">17:1-9</a>; <a href="../bible/gen018.htm#vrs17">18:17-19</a>; <a href="../bible/gen022.htm#vrs16">22:16-18</a>; <a href="../bible/gen026.htm#vrs1">26:1-5</a>; <a href="../bible/gen027.htm#vrs1">27:1-15</a>; <a href="../bible/num024.htm#vrs15">Numbers 24:15-19</a>; <a href="../bible/2sa007.htm#vrs1">2 Samuel 7:1-16</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch017.htm#vrs1">1 Chronicles 17:1-17</a>; <a href="../bible/jer023.htm#vrs1">Jeremiah 23:1-8</a>; <a href="../bible/jer033.htm#vrs14">33:14-26</a>; <a href="../bible/eze017.htm">Ezekiel 17</a>). The Royal Psalmist extols the Divine genealogy of the future <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> in the words: "The Lord hath said to me: Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee" (Ps. ii, 7).

<p>(2) The Prophets frequently speak of the birth of the expected Christ. They locate its place in Bethlehem of Juda (<a href="../bible/mic005.htm#vrs2">Micah 5:2-14</a>), they determine its time by the passing of the sceptre from Juda (<a href="../bible/gen049.htm#vrs8">Genesis 49:8-12</a>), by the seventy weeks of Daniel (ix, 22-27), and by the "little while" mentioned in the Book of Aggeus (ii, 1-10). The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> seers <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> will be born of a Virgin Mother (<a href="../bible/isa007.htm#vrs1">Isaiah 7:1-17</a>), and that His appearance, at least His public appearance, will be preceded by a precursor (<a href="../bible/isa040.htm#vrs1">Isaiah 40:1-11</a>; <a href="../bible/mal004.htm#vrs5">Malachi 4:5-6</a>).

<p>(3) Certain events connected with the infancy of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> have been deemed important enough to be the subject of prophetic prediction. Among these are the adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> (Ps. lxxxi, 1-17), the slaughter of the innocents (<a href="../bible/jer031.htm#vrs15">Jeremiah 31:15-26</a>), and the flight into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (<a href="../bible/hos011.htm#vrs1">Hosea 11:1-7</a>). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in the case of these prophecies, as it happens in the case of many others, their fulfilment is their clearest commentary; but this does not undo the fact that the events were really predicted.

<p>(4) Perhaps there is less need of insisting on the predictions of the better known <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> names and titles, seeing that they involve less obscurity. Thus in the prophecies of Zacharias the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> is called the Orient, or, according to the Hebrew text, the "bud" (iii; vi, 9-15), in the Book of Daniel He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> (vii), in the Prophecy of Malachias He is the Angel of the Testament (ii, 17; iii, 6), in the writings of <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> He is the Saviour (<a href="../bible/isa051.htm#vrs1">51:1</a>, <a href="../bible/isa052.htm#vrs12">52:12</a> and <a href="../bible/isa062.htm">62</a>), the Servant of the Lord (<a href="../bible/isa049.htm#vrs1">49:1</a>), the Emmanuel (<a href="../bible/isa008.htm#vrs1">8:1-10</a>), the Prince of peace (<a href="../bible/isa009.htm#vrs1">9:1-7</a>).



<p>(5) The <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> offices are considered in a general way in the latter part of <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> (<a href="../bible/isa061.htm">61</a>); in particular, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> is considered as <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the Book of Deuteronomy (xviii, 9-22); as king in the Canticle of Anna (<a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#vrs1">1 Samuel 2:1-10</a>) and in the royal song of the Psalmist (xliv); as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> type <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> (<a href="../bible/gen014.htm#vrs14">Genesis 14:14-20</a>) and in the Psalmist's words "a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> forever" (cix); as Goel, or Avenger, in the second part of <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> (<a href="../bible/isa063.htm#vrs1">63:1-6</a>); as mediator of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, under the form of a covenant of the people (<a href="../bible/isa042.htm#vrs1">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="../bible/isa043.htm#vrs13">43:13</a>), and of the light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> (<a href="../bible/isa049.htm">Isaiah 49</a>).

<p>(6) As to the public life of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, Isaias gives us a general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the fulness of the Spirit investing the Anointed (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#vrs1">11:1-16</a>), and of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> work (<a href="../bible/isa055.htm">55</a>). The Psalmist presents a picture of the Good Shepherd (<a href="../bible/psa022.htm">22</a>); <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> summarizes the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> (<a href="../bible/isa035.htm">35</a>); Zacharias exclaims, "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion", thus predicting <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> solemn entrance into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; the Psalmist refers to this same event when he mentions the praise out of the mouth of infants (<a href="../bible/psa008.htm">8</a>). To return once more to the Book of Isaias, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> foretells the rejection of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> through a league with death (<a href="../bible/isa027.htm">27</a>); the Psalmist alludes to the same mystery where he speaks of the stone which the builders rejected (<a href="../bible/psa117.htm">117</a>).

<p>(7) Need we say that the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> were fully predicted by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>? The general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> victim is presented in the context of the words "sacrifice and oblation thou wouldst not" (Ps. xxxix); in the passage beginning with the resolve "Let us put wood on his bread" (<a href="../bible/jer011.htm">Jeremiah 11</a>), and in the sacrifice described by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Malachias (i). Besides, the series of the particular events which constitute the history of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> has been described by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with a remarkable minuteness: the Psalmist refers to His betrayal in the words "the man of my peace . . . supplanted me" (xl), and Zacharias knows of the "thirty pieces of silver" (xi); the Psalmist <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in the anguish of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is a type of Christ in His <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">agony</a> (Ps. liv); His capture is foretold in the words "pursue and take him" and "they will hunt after the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the just" (Ps. lxx; xciii); His trial with its <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> witnesses may be found represented in the words "unjust witnesses have risen up against me, and iniquity hath lied to itself" (Ps. xxvi); His flagellation is portrayed in the description of the man of sorrows (<a href="../bible/isa052.htm#vrs13">Isaiah 52:13</a>; <a href="../bible/isa053.htm#vrs12">53:12</a>) and the words "scourges were gathered together upon me" (Ps. xxxiv); the betrayer's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lot is pictured in the imprecations of <a href="../bible/psa108.htm">Psalm 108</a>; the crucifixion is referred to in the passages "What are these wounds in the midst of thy hands?" (<a href="../bible/zec013.htm">Zechariah 13</a>), "Let us condemn him to a most shameful death" (<a href="../bible/wis002.htm">Wisdom 2</a>), and "They have dug my hands and my feet" (Ps. xxi); the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> darkness occurs in <a href="../bible/amo008.htm">Amos 8</a>; the gall and vinegar are spoken of in <a href="../bible/psa068.htm">Psalm 68</a>; the pierced heart of Christ is foreshadowed in <a href="../bible/zec012.htm">Zechariah 12</a>. The sacrifice of Isaac (<a href="../bible/gen021.htm#vrs1">Genesis 21:1-14</a>), the scapegoat (<a href="../bible/lev016.htm#vrs1">Leviticus 16:1-28</a>), the ashes of purification (<a href="../bible/num019.htm#vrs1">Numbers 19:1-10</a>), and the brazen serpent (<a href="../bible/num021.htm#vrs4">Numbers 21:4-9</a>) hold a prominent place among the types prefiguring the suffering <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>. The third chapter of Lamentations is justly considered as the dirge of our buried Redeemer.

<p>(8) Finally, the glory of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> has been foretold by the Prophets of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. The context of such phrases as "I have risen because the Lord hath protected me" (<a href="../bible/psa003.htm">Psalm 3</a>), "My flesh shall rest in hope (<a href="../bible/psa015.htm">Psalm 15</a>), "On the third day he will raise us up" (<a href="../bible/hos005.htm#vrs15">Hosea 5:15</a>, <a href="../bible/hos006.htm#vrs3">6:3</a>), "O death, I will be thy death" (<a href="../bible/hos013.htm#vrs6">Hosea 13:6-15a</a>), and "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my Redeemer liveth" (<a href="../bible/job019.htm#vrs23">Job 19:23-27</a>) referred the devout Jewish worshipper to something more than a merely earthly restoration, the fulfilment of which began to be realized in the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>. This mystery is also implied, at least typically, in the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first fruits</a> of the harvest (<a href="../bible/lev023.htm#vrs9">Leviticus 23:9-14</a>) and the delivery of Jonas from the belly of the fish (<a href="../bible/jon002.htm">Jonah 2</a>). Nor is the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of the Messias</a> the only element of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> glory predicted by the Prophets. <a href="../bible/psa067.htm">Psalm 67</a> refers to the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>; Joel, ii, 28-32, to the coming of the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>; <a href="../bible/isa009.htm">Isaiah 9</a>, to the call of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; Mich., iv, 1-7, to the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">Synagogue</a>; <a href="../bible/dan002.htm#vrs27">Daniel 2:27-47</a>, to the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> as compared with the kingdom of the world. Other characteristics of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a> are typified by the tabernacle (<a href="../bible/exo025.htm#vrs8">Exodus 25:8-9</a>; <a href="../bible/exo029.htm#vrs43">29:43</a>; <a href="../bible/exo040.htm#vrs33">40:33-36</a>; <a href="../bible/num009.htm#vrs15">Numbers 9:15-23</a>), the mercy-seat (<a href="../bible/exo025.htm#vrs17">Exodus 25:17-22</a>; <a href="../bible/psa079.htm#vrs1">Psalm 79:1</a>), Aaron the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> (<a href="../bible/exo028.htm#vrs1">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="../bible/exo030.htm#vrs1">30:1</a>; 10; <a href="../bible/num016.htm#vrs39">Numbers 16:39-40</a>), the <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> (<a href="../bible/exo016.htm#vrs1">Exodus 16:1-15</a>; <a href="../bible/psa077.htm#vrs24">Psalm 77:24-25</a>), and the rock of Horeb (<a href="../bible/exo017.htm#vrs5">Exodus 17:5-7</a>; <a href="../bible/num020.htm#vrs10">Numbers 20:10-11</a>; <a href="../bible/psa104.htm#vrs41">Psalm 104:41</a>). A Canticle of thanksgiving for the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> benefits is found in <a href="../bible/isa012.htm">Isaiah 12</a>.

<p>The Books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are not the only source from which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> may learn the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of pre-Christian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewry</a>. The Sibylline oracles, the Book of Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, the Psalms of Solomon, the Ascensio Moysis, the Revelation of Baruch, the Fourth Book of Esdras, and several Talmudic and Rabbinic writings are rich depositories of pre-Christian views concerning the expected <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>. Not that all of these works were written before the coming of Christ; but, though partially post-Christian in their authorship, they preserve a picture of the Jewish world of thought, dating back, at least in its outline, centuries before the coming of Christ.
<h2>New Testament</h2>

<p>Some modern writers tell us that there are two Christs, as it were, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> of history. They regard the Lord and Christ, Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exalted by raising Him from the dead, as the subject of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, the preacher and worker of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, as the theme of the historian. They assure us that it is quite impossible to persuade even the least experienced critic that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> taught, in formal terms and at one and the same time, the Christology of Paul, that of John, and the doctrines of Nic&aelig;a, of Ephesus, and of Chalcedon. Otherwise the history of the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> centuries appears to these writers to be quite inconceivable. The <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> is said to lack the data which underlie the definitions of the first ecumenical councils and to supply testimony that is not a supplement, but a corrective, of the portrait of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> drawn by the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a>. These two accounts of the Christ are represented as mutually exclusive: if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spoke and acted as He speaks and acts in the Synoptic Gospels, then He cannot have spoken and acted as He is reported by St. John. We shall here briefly review the Christology of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a>, of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptics</a>. Thus we shall give the reader a complete Christology of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and at the same time the data <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to control the contentions of the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a>. The Christology will not, however, be complete in the sense that it extends to all the details concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> taught in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, but in the sense that it gives His essential characteristics taught in the whole of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.
<h3 id="A">Pauline Christology</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> insists on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> real humanity and Divinity, in spite of the fact that at first sight the reader is confronted with three objects in the Apostle's writings: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the human world, and the Mediator. But then the latter is both Divine and human, both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man.

<p><em>(a) Christ's Humanity in the Pauline Epistles</em>

<p>The expressions "form of a servant", "in habit found as a man", "in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> flesh" (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs7">Philippians 2:7</a>; <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs3">Romans 8:3</a>) may seem to impair the real humanity of Christ in the Pauline teaching. But in reality they only describe a mode of being or hint at the presence of a higher nature in Christ not seen by the senses, or they contrast <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with the nature of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> race to which it belongs. On the other hand the Apostle plainly speaks of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> manifested in the flesh (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#vrs16">1 Timothy 3:16</a>), as possessing a body of flesh (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs22">Colossians 1:22</a>), as being "made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs4">Galatians 4:4</a>), as being born of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs3">Romans 1:3</a>), as belonging according to the flesh to the race of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#vrs5">Romans 9:5</a>). As a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was born under the Law (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs4">Galatians 4:4</a>). The Apostle dwells with emphasis on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> real share in our physical human weakness (<a href="../bible/2co013.htm#vrs4">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>), on His life of suffering (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#vrs8">Hebrews 5:8</a>) reaching its climax in the Passion (ibid., 1:5; <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs10">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs24">Colossians 1:24</a>). Only in two respects did <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> humanity differ from the rest of men: first in its entire sinlessness (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs21">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs17">Galatians 2:17</a>; <a href="../bible/rom007.htm#vrs3">Romans 7:3</a>); secondly, in the fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> was the second Adam, representing the whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a> (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs12">Romans 5:12-21</a>; <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs45">1 Corinthians 15:45-49</a>).
<h3 id="B">Christ's divinity in the Pauline epistles</h3>

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, the superiority of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> revelation over all other Divine manifestations, and the perfection of the New Covenant with its sacrifice and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, are derived from the fact that Christ is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs1">Hebrews 1:1 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/heb005.htm#vrs5">5:5 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#vrs5">2:5 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs3">Romans 1:3</a>; <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs4">Galatians 4:4</a>; <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs13">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs12">Colossians 1:12 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs9">2:9 sq.</a>; etc.). The Apostle understands by the expression <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">"Son of God"</a> not a merely moral dignity, or a merely external relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which began in time, but an eternal and immanent relation of Christ to the Father. He contrasts Christ with, and finds Him superior to, Aaron and his successors, Moses and the Prophets (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#vrs4">Hebrews 5:4</a>; <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#vrs11">10:11</a>; <a href="../bible/heb007.htm#vrs1">7:1-22</a>; <a href="../bible/heb003.htm#vrs1">3:1-6</a>; <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs1">1:1</a>). He raises Christ above the choirs of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and makes Him their Lord and Master (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs3">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs14">14</a>; <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#vrs2">2:2-3</a>), and seats Him as heir of all things at the right hand of the Father (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs2">Hebrews 1:2-3</a>; <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs14">Galatians 4:14</a>; <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs20">Ephesians 1:20-21</a>). If <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to use the terms "form of God", "image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", when he speaks of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divinity, in order to show the personal distinction between the Eternal Father and the Divine Son (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs6">Philippians 2:6</a>; <a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs15">Colossians 1:15</a>), Christ is not merely the image and glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs7">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>), but also the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> before any created beings (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs15">Colossians 1:15</a>), in Whom, and by Whom, and for Whom all things were made (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs16">Colossians 1:16</a>), in Whom the fulness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> resides with that actual reality which we attach to the presence of the material bodies perceptible and measurable through the organs of our senses (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs9">Colossians 2:9</a>), in a word, "who is over all things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> blessed for ever" (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#vrs5">Romans 9:5</a>).
<h3 id="B">Christology of the Catholic epistles</h3>

<p>The Epistles of St. John will be considered together with the other writings of the same Apostle in the next paragraph. Under the present heading we shall briefly indicate the views concerning Christ held by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> St. James, St. Peter, and St. Jude.

<p><em>(a) The Epistle of St. James</em>

<p>The mainly practical scope of the Epistle of St. James does not lead us to expect that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> Divinity would be formally expressed in it as a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is, however, implied in the language of the inspired writer. He professes to stand in the same relation to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being the servant of both (i, 1): he applies the same term to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> as to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (<em>passim</em>). <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is both the sovereign judge and independent lawgiver, who can save and can destroy (iv, 12); the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the lord of Glory (ii, 1). The language of St. James would be exaggerated and overstrained on any other supposition than the writer's firm <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.

<p><em>(b) Belief of St. Peter</em>

<p>St. Peter presents himself as the servant and the apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#vrs1">1 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs1">2 Peter 1:1</a>), who was predicted by the Prophets of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> in such a way that the Prophets themselves were <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own servants, heralds, and organs (<a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#vrs10">1 Peter 1:10-11</a>). It is the pre-existent Christ who moulds the utterances of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a> to proclaim their anticipations of His advent. St. Peter had witnessed the glory of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the Transfiguration (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs16">2 Peter 1:16</a>); he appears to take pleasure in multiplying His titles: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Our Lord (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs2">2 Peter 1:2</a>), our Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (ibid., i, 14, 16), the Lord and Saviour (ibid., iii, 2), our Lord and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (ibid., i, 1), Whose power is Divine (ibid., i, 3), through whose promises <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are made partakers of the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">nature of God</a> (ibid., i, 4). Throughout his Epistle, therefore, St. Peter feels, as it were, and implies the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.

<p><em>(c) Epistle of St. Jude</em>

<p>St. Jude, too, introduces himself as the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, through union with whom <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are kept in a life of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> (1); Christ is our only Lord and Saviour (4), Who punished <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the wilderness and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">rebel angels</a> (5), Who will come to judgment surrounded by myriads of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (14), and to Whom <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> look for the mercy which He will show them at His coming (21), the issue of which will be life everlasting. Can a merely human Christ be the subject of this language?
<h3 id="C">Johannean Christology</h3>

<p>If there were nothing else in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> to prove the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the first fourteen verses in the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> would suffice to convince a believer in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of this prologue is the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the whole Johannean <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. The Word made flesh is the same with the Word Who was in the beginning, on the one hand, and with the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the subject of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> on the other. The whole Gospel is a history of the Eternal Word dwelling in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> among men.

<p>The teaching of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> is also found in the Johannean Epistles. In his very opening words the writer tells his readers that the Word of life has become manifest and that the Apostles had seen and heard and handled the Word incarnate. The denial of the Son implies the loss of the Father (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs23">1 John 2:23</a>), and "whosoever shall confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abideth in him and he in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (ibid., iv, 15). Towards the end of the Epistle the writer is still more emphatic: "And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is come: and he hath given us understanding that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>, and may be in his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son. This is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a> and life eternal" (ibid., v, 20).

<p>According to the Apocalypse, Christ is the first and the last, the alpha and the omega, the eternal and the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">almighty</a> (i, 8; xxi, 6; xxii, 13). He is the king of kings and lord of lords (xix, 16), the lord of the unseen world (xii, 10; xiii, 8), the centre of the court of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (v, 6); He receives the adoration of the highest <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (v, 8), and as the object of that uninterrupted worship (v, 12), He is associated with the Father (v, 13; xvii, 14).
<h3 id="D">Christology of the synoptists</h3>

<p>There is a real difference between the first three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> and St. John in their respective representations of our Lord. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> presented by these writers may be the same, but they view it from different standpoints. The three <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a> set forth the humanity of Christ in its obedience to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, in its power over nature, and in its tenderness for the weak and afflicted; the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">fourth Gospel</a> sets forth the life of Christ not in any of the aspects which belong to it as human, but as being the adequate expression of the glory of the Divine Person, manifested to men under a visible form. But in spite of this difference, the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a> by their suggestive implication practically anticipate the teaching of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>. This suggestion is implied, first, in the Synoptic use of the title <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> as applied to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, not merely in an <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> or theocratic sense, not merely as one among many sons, but He is the only, the well-beloved Son of the Father, so that His sonship is unshared by any other, and is absolutely unique (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs17">Matthew 3:17</a>, <a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs5">17:5</a>; <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs41">22:41</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs3">4:3, 6</a>; <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs3">Luke 4:3, 9</a>); it is derived from the fact that the Holy Ghost was to come upon Mary, and the power of the Most High was to overshadow her (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs35">Luke 1:35</a>). Again, the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a> imply <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divinity in their history of His nativity and its accompanying circumstances; He is conceived of the Holy Ghost (Luke, 1, 35), and His mother knows that all generations shall call her blessed, because the mighty one had done great things unto her (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs48">Luke 1:48</a>). Elisabeth calls Mary blessed among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the fruit of her womb, and marvels that she herself should be visited by the mother of her Lord (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs42">Luke 1:42-43</a>). Gabriel greets <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> as full of grace, and blessed among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; her Son will be great, He will be called the Son of the Most High, and of His kingdom there will be no end (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs28">Luke 1:28, 32</a>). As new-born infant, Christ is adored by the shepherds and the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, representatives of the Jewish and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> world. Simeon sees in the child his Lord's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and glory of his people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs30">Luke 2:30-32</a>). These accounts hardly fit in with the limits of a merely human child, but they become intelligible in the light of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a> agree with the teaching of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> not merely in their use of the term <em><a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em> and in their accounts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth with its surrounding details, but also in their narratives of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, life, and work. The very term <em><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a></em>, which they often apply to Christ, is used in such a way that it shows in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> a self-consciousness for which the human element is not something primary, but something secondary and superinduced. Often Christ is simply called Son (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs27">Matthew 11:27</a>; <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs20">28:20</a>), and correspondingly He never calls the Father "our" Father, but "my" Father (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs10">Matthew 18:10, 19, 35</a>; <a href="../bible/mat020.htm#vrs23">20:23</a>; <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs53">26:53</a>). At His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and transfiguration He receives witness from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to His Divine Son-ship; the Prophets of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are not rivals, but servants in comparison with Him (<a href="../bible/mat021.htm#vrs34">Matthew 21:34</a>); hence the title <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> implies a nature to which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> humanity was an accessory. Again, Christ claims the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and supports His claim by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs2">Matthew 9:2-6</a>; <a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs20">Luke 5:20, 24</a>); He insists on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Himself (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs16">Matthew 16:16, 17</a>), He inserts His name in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> formula between that of the Father and the Holy Ghost (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs19">Matthew 28:19</a>), He alone knows the Father and is known by the Father alone (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs27">Matthew 11:27</a>), He institutes the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs26">Matthew 26:26</a>; <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs22">Mark 14:22</a>; <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs19">Luke 22:19</a>), He suffers and dies only to rise again the third day (<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#vrs19">Matthew 20:19</a>; <a href="../bible/mar010.htm#vrs34">Mark 10:34</a>; <a href="../bible/luk018.htm#vrs33">Luke 18:33</a>) He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascends into Heaven</a>, but declares that He will be among us till the end of the world (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs20">Matthew 28:20</a>).

<p>Need we add that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> claims to the most exalted dignity of His <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> are unmistakably clear in the <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatological</a> discourses of the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a>? He is the Lord of the material and moral <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; as supreme lawgiver He revises all other legislation; as final judge He determines the fate of all. Blot the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> out of the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">Canon of the New Testament</a>, and you still have in the Synoptic Gospels the identical <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> which we now draw out of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a>; some points of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> might be less clearly stated than they are now, but they would remain substantially the same.
<h2>Christian tradition</h2>

<p>Biblical Christology shows that one and the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man. While <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian tradition</a> has always maintained this triple thesis that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is truly man, that He is truly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the Godman, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, is one and the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> tenets of various religious leaders have forced the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to insist more expressly now on the one, now on another element of her Christology. A classified list of the principal <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and of the subsequent <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> utterances will show the historical development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> with sufficient clearness. The reader will find a more lengthy account of the principal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and councils under their respective headings.
<h3 id="A">Humanity of Christ</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was denied even in the earliest ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The Docetist <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and the Priscillianists grant to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> only an apparent body; the Valentinians, a body brought down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. The followers of Apollinaris deny either that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had any human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at all, or that He possessed the higher part of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, they maintain that the Word supplies either the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in Christ, or at least its higher faculties. In more recent times it is not so much <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humanity as His <em>real</em> manhood that is denied. According to <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> creed deals with the ideal, not with the historical <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; according to Jacobi, it worships <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> not as an historical <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, but as a <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> ideal; according to Fichte there exists an absolute unity between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the first to see and teach it; according to Schelling, the incarnation is an eternal fact, which happened to reach in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> its highest point, according to <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, Christ is not the actual <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a> but the symbol of <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">God's incarnation</a> in humanity at large. Finally, certain recent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers distinguish between the Christ of history and the Christ of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, thus destroying in the Christ of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> His historical reality. The New Syllabus (Proposit, 29 sq.) and the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi dominici gregis" may be consulted on these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>.
<h3 id="B">Divinity of Christ</h3>

<p>Even in Apostolic times the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> regarded a denial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divinity as eminently anti-Christian (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs22">1 John 2:22-23</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs3">4:3</a>; <a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#vrs7">2 John 7</a>). The early <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the most ancient Fathers, and the first <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> agree in their profession of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divinity. Still, the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, the Theodotians, the <a href="../cathen/01755a.htm">Artemonites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a> looked upon Christ either as a mere man, though singularly enlightened by Divine wisdom, or as the appearance of an <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;on</a> emanating from the Divine Being according to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> theory; or again as a manifestation of the Divine Being such as the Theistic and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> Sabellians and Patripassians admitted; or, finally, as the incarnate Word indeed, but the Word conceived after the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> manner as a creature mediating between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the world, at least not essentially identical with the Father and the Holy Ghost. Though the definitions of <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a> and of the subsequent councils, especially of the Fourth Lateran, deal directly with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Most Holy Trinity</a>, still they also teach that the Word is <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantial</a> with the Father and the Holy Ghost, and thus establish the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Word incarnate. In more recent times, our earliest <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> endeavoured to avoid the problem of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; they had little to say of him, while they made <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> the founder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But the historical Christ was too impressive a figure to be long neglected. It is all the more to be regretted that in recent times a practical denial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divinity is not confined to the <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a> and such writers as Ewald and Schleiermacher. Others who profess to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> see in Christ the perfect revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> head and lord of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, but, after all, they end with <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> words, "Behold, the man".
<h3 id="C">Hypostatic Union</h3>

<p>His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and His Divine nature are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">united hypostatically</a>, i.e. united in the hypostasis or the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Word. This <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> too has found bitter opponents from the earliest times of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nestorius and his followers admitted in Christ one moral <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as a human <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> forms one moral <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; but this moral <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> results from the union of two physical <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, just as there are two natures in Christ. These two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are united, not physically, but morally, by means of grace. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Nestorius was condemned by <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Celestine I</a> in the Roman Synod of A.D. 430 and by the Council of Ephesus, A.D. 431, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> was again insisted on in the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> and the second Council of Constantinople. It follows that the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are physically united in Christ. The <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, therefore, believed that in this physical union either the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was absorbed by the Divine, according to the views of <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>; or that the Divine nature was absorbed by the human; or, again, that out of the physical union of the two resulted a third nature by a kind of physical mixture, as it were, or at least by means of their physical composition. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> was upheld by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo the Great</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, and the Fifth Ecumenical Council, A.D. 553. The twelfth canon of the last-named council excludes also the view that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> moral life developed gradually, attaining its completion only after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. The Adoptionists renewed <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> in part because they considered the Word as the natural <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and the man Christ as a servant or an adopted <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, thus granting its own <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. This opinion was rejected by <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a>, the Synod of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, A.D. 782, the <a href="../cathen/06236a.htm">Council of Frankfort</a> (794), and by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> in the Roman Synod (799). There is no need to point out that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Christ is not united with the Word, according to the <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinian</a> and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> views. Dorner shows how widespread among <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> these views are, since there is hardly a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of note who refuses its own <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Berruyer and G&uuml;nther reintroduced a modified <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>; but they were censured by the Congregation of the Index (17 April, 1755) and by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> (15 Jan., 1857). The <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was renewed by the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>, admitting only one will in Christ and thus contradicting the teaching of Popes <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Martin I</a> and Agatho and of the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth Ecumenical Council</a>. Both the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">schismatic Greeks</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> of the sixteenth century wished to retain the traditional <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the Word Incarnate; but even the earliest followers of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> fell into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> involving both the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15117a.htm">Ubiquitarians</a>, for example, find the essence of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> not in the assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by the Word, but in the divinization of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by sharing the properties of the Divine nature. The subsequent <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> drifted away farther still from the views of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian tradition</a>; Christ for them was the sage of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, perhaps even the greatest of the Prophets, whose Biblical record, half myth and half history, is nothing but the expression of a popular <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of human perfection. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers whose views were derogatory either to the historical character of the Biblical account of the life of Christ or to his prerogatives as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>-<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> have been censured in the new Syllabus and the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi dominici gregis".
