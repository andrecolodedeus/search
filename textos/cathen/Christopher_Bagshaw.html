<h1>Christopher Bagshaw</h1>  

<p>Convert, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> for the Faith, and a prominent figure in the controversies between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the reign of Elizabeth. He came of a Derbyshire <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, but the year of his birth is unknown. He died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> sometime after 1625. Bagshaw was at St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1566, was graduated <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B.A.</a> at Balliol, Oxford, 1572, and probably became a Fellow of that college in the same year. As a Fellow he was a party to the expulsion from the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the afterwards famous <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father Parsons.

<p>At proceeding M. A. in 1575, Bagshaw was still a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. His administration as Principal of Gloucester Hall (1579) was unpopular and brief. In 1582, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Going to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the permission of <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen</a>, he entered the English College. It is said by Bullen, that he was expelled by Cardinal Boncompagni for his quarrelsome temper and unpopularity. <a href="../cathen/16041a.htm">Foley's</a> list of students of the English College does not contain his name. Later, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he proceeded doctor of divinity and doctor of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, though afterwards he was dubbed by his <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> opponents <em>doctor erraticus, doctor per saltum</em>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> (1587) in the Tower of London, under the statute of 27th of Elizabeth, an act against <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and Seminarists. (The text of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is in Hardy and Gee.) With a number of other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> out of the more than 400 labouring in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in Wisbeach Castle, 1593.

<p>There now came to a head a factional division among the labourers on the English mission. There were two original sources of difference: the existence of a Spanish faction, headed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits'</a> control of the English College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Cf. <a href="../cathen/14779b.htm">Dodd</a> and <a href="../cathen/14723b.htm">Tierney</a>; <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a>). The partisan feelings aroused found vent in two controversies in which Bagshaw was prominent, if not first, on the side opposed to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and their friends. The earlier dispute, arbitrated after nine months, arose from the vigorous opposition of Bagshaw and the elder <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to the introduction of a religious rule among the thirty-three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in Wisbeach Castle. Later, when, partly for the purpose of consolidating English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sentiment in favour of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> successor to Elizabeth, <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a> placed at the head of the English Mission, as <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, Father George Blackwell, with instructions to consult the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> provincial on matters of importance (<a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a> VIII, vii), Bagshaw headed a party of protest, which, on being disciplined, appealed, with the secret aid of Elizabeth's government, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Their appeal was in part successful, though the appointment was confirmed.

<p>Bagshaw, after his liberation, resided abroad, and is described in Daniel Featley's "Transubstantiation Exploded" as having been Rector of Ave Maria College. This work was published in 1638, and contained notes of a public disputation with Bagshaw. His death and burial, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, occurred after 1625. He may have written in part "A true Relation of the Faction begun at Wisbich by Father Edmonds, alias Weston, a Jesuit, 1595, and continued since by Father Walley, alias Garnet, the Provincial of the Jesuits in England, and by Father Parsons in Rome" (1601); "Relatio Compendiosa Turbarum quas Jesuit&aelig; Angli un&aacute; cum D. Georgio Blackwello, Archipresbytero, Sacerdotibus Seminariorum, Populoque Catholico concivere", etc. (Rouen, 1601).
