<h1>Christopher Bainbridge</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, b. at Hilton, near Appleby, in Westmoreland, probably 1464; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 14 July, 1514. He proceeded to <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, entering Queen's College, of which he became <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> in or before 1495, being about that time admitted LL.D.; he became later a liberal benefactor to his college. He held a number of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, including the treasurership of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, on Henry VII's presentation, and Master of the Rolls, a post he held till his elevation to the See of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, which took place in 1507, nominated thereto by the king, who restored the temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to him. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 12 December. This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> he held but a short while, being translated to York the next year by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 20 September, 1508. In 1509 he was sent by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> as his ambassador to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> created him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> on 10 March, 1511, giving him the title of St. Praxedis, in reward for negotiating Henry's adherence to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, for which country he felt a strong antipathy all his life. As <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> he was commissioned by Julius to lead a military expedition against <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, which he successfully besieged. He endeavoured to secure from <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a> the bestowal on Henry of the title of "Most Christian King" which Louis of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had forfeited by waging <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; but the peace of 1514 made this project abortive. Bainbridge was poisoned by an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Rinaldo de <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, who acted as his steward or bursar, in revenge for a blow which the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, a man of violent temper, had given him. It was hinted that the crime was perpetrated at the instigation of Sylvester de Gigiis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, the resident English ambassador at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but de Giglis exonerated himself. Bainbridge was buried in the English Hospice, now known as the English College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was a stout upholder of Henry's interests at the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>.
