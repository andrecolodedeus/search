<h1>Christopher Holywood</h1>  

<p>(<em>Latinized</em>, A Sacrobosco.)

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>; b. At Artane, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, in 1559; d. 4 September, 1626. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, which draws its name from Holywood (<em>Saithne</em>), a village near <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, had long been distinguished both in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Christopher Holywood studied at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at D&ocirc;le in 1579, was afterwards professor of Scripture and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Pont-a-Mousson, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and Padua, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> in the latter places. In 1598 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but was arrested on his way and confined in the Gatehouse Prison, the Tower of London and Wisbech Castle, and was eventually shipped to the Continent after the death of Queen Elizabeth. He then resumed his interrupted journey and reached <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> on St. Patrick's Eve, 1604. This same year he published two Latin controversial works at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. He was soon appointed superior of his brethren, a post of great importance in the absence of all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, for it had been impossible, during the fiery trial of Elizabeth's reign, even to preserve their succession. Holywood's letters and reports on the state of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, of which over a score have been printed by Hogan, throw a vivid light on the history of the country. On the accession of King James, there had been a reaction in favour of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and if this was strong even in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (see <a href="../cathen/07081b.htm">GUNPOWDER PLOT</a>), it was far stronger in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, leading in many cases to the reassumption of the old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches. Father Holywood and his fellow <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had their hands full of work, reconciling the lapsed, settling quarrels, and healing the numberless wounds which the barbarous <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> had inflicted on the country. Though there were only four <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> when he landed, their number rapidly increased, and there were forty-two when he died, besides sixty others in training or occupied in teaching on the Continent. The times of peaceful progress soon passed away, and after the imposition of the Oath of Allegiance there followed a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> as severe as that of Elizabeth, and far more systematic. By the enforced <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of their children as <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, many noble and influential <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> were lost to the Faith, and the lands of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were freely given to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> settlers from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The prospect became ever more gloomy. Yet Holywood's reports show that here and there the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> continued to make substantial progress. At Kilkenny, for instance, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which lasted till Cromwell's time was begun in 1619. Five "residences", or bases for <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Fathers, were established, whence missionaries were sent out in all directions, who worked with great success. Father <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, about the same time, was sent to the islands and sea-coast of the west of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. These years were perhaps the most laborious and fruitful of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> mission. Holywood's last extant report is for the year 1624.
