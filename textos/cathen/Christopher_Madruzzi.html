<h1>Christopher Madruzzi</h1>  

<p>Born of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, 5 July, 1512; died at <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 5 July, 1578. He studied at Padua and Bologna, received in 1529 from his older brother a canonicate at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Tirol near Meran, was in 1536 a Canon of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, in 1537 of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, and in 1539 became Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. Being only a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at the time, he was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deaconship</a>, <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and episcopate in 1542. In January, 1543, he was appointed administrator of the <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">See of Brixen</a>, and shortly afterwards, during the same year 1543, he was raised to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> (1534-49). Having resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> in 1567, he spent the latter years of his life in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> successively of Sabina, <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, and Porto. A few years after his death his remains were entombed in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Onofrio, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Madruzzi was a man of great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> gifts, well versed in secular and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> (1519-56) and his brother, King Ferdinand I, afterwards emperor (1556-64), esteemed him very highly and employed him in many important and delicate missions. In the controversies between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, at the time of the incipient <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, he always proved himself a ready champion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He took an active part in the imperial Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (1541) as representative of the emperor, and upheld strenuously the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, and temporal ruler of that principality he naturally played a prominent part in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Among other things he insisted that the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be taken up in earnest, a matter much desired by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, and by which it was hoped to win the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was largely due to his efforts, that this subject was discussed and enactments of that character were passed in each session together with decisions on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> matters. He was also intent upon promoting a truly religious and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life among both the people and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. For the first he recommended chiefly yearly confession and communion; and for the second an edifying, chaste, and temperate conduct, and an exact fulfilment of all the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> connected with their high office. He was himself cultured and learned, and patronized with great munificence the liberal arts and learning. One stain attaches to his memory, the accumulation of several <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in his hands. Mention was made of the smaller <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> holdings; in addition to his two sees he received in 1546, by the favour of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, a yearly allowance of 2000 ducats from the Spanish Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/04187b.htm">Compostela</a>. He may be somewhat excused in view of the usage of the time, and of the financial burdens imposed on him during the sessions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; moreover, in 1567, he gave up one of his two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>.
