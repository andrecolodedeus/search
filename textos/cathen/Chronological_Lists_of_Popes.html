<h1>Chronological Lists of Popes</h1>  

<p><em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">POPE</a>, <a href="../cathen/12272b.htm">LIST OF POPES</a>, <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">PAPAL ELECTIONS</a>, <a href="../cathen/12270a.htm">ELECTION OF THE POPE</a>.

<p>The historical <a href="../cathen/12272b.htm">lists of the popes</a>, from those drawn up in the second century to those of the present day, form in themselves a considerable body of literature. It would be beyond the scope of the article to enter upon a discussion of these catalogues. For an account of the most famous of them all, the article <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">LIBER PONTIFICALIS</a> may be consulted. It appears, however, desirable to indicate very briefly what are our authorities for the names and the durations in office of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> for the first two centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> existence.

<p><a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Irenaeus</a>, writing between 175 and 190, not many years after his Roman sojourn, enumerates the series from Peter to Eleutherius (<a href="../fathers/0103303.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III.3.3</a>; Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.6</a>). His object, as we have already seen, was to establish the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">traditional</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as opposed to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> novelties, by showing that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the natural inheritor of the <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> teaching. He gives us the names alone, not the length of the various episcopates. This need is supplied by other <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>.

<p>Most important evidence is furnished by the document entitled the "Liberian Catalogue" &#151; so called from the <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope</a> whose name ends the list. The collection of tracts of which this forms a part was edited (apparently by one Furius Dionysius Philocalus) in 354. The catalogue consists of a list of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishops</a> from Peter to <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, with the length of their respective episcopates, the consular <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a>, the name of the reigning emperor, and in many cases other details. There is the strongest ground for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that the earlier part of the catalogue, as far as <a href="../cathen/12229b.htm"> Pontian</a> (230-35), is the work of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus of Portus</a>. It is manifest that up to this point the fourth century compiler was making use of a different authority from that which he employs for the subsequent <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>: and there is evidence rendering it almost <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus's</a> work "Chronica" contained such a list. The reign of <a href="../cathen/12229b.htm"> Pontian</a>, moreover, would be the point at which that list would have stopped: for <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> and he were condemned to servitude in the <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinian</a> mines &#151; a fact which the chronographer makes mention when speaking of <a href="../cathen/12229b.htm"> Pontian's</a> episcopate. Lightfoot has argued that this list originally contained nothing but the names of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the duration of their episcopates, the remaining notes being additions by a later hand. The list of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> is identical with that of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, save that Anacletus is doubled into <a href="../cathen/04054a.htm">Cletus</a> and <a href="../cathen/01446a.htm">Anacletus</a>, while Clement appears before, instead of after, these two names. The order of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Popes</a> <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius</a> and <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> has also been interchanged. There is every reason to regard these differences as due to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of copyists.

<p>Another <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">names</a> and episcopal years of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> can be gathered alike from his "History" and his <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">"Chronicle"</a>. The notices in the two works; can be shown to be in agreement, notwithstanding certain corruptions in many texts of the <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">"Chronicle"</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> list in the hands of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> is seen to have been identical with the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western</a> list of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, except that in the East the name of <a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus's</a> successor seems to have been given as Anencletus, in the original <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western</a> list as <a href="../cathen/04054a.htm">Cletus</a>.

<p>The two authorities presuppose the following list: (1) Peter, xxv; (2) <a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a>, xii; (3) Anencletus [<a href="../cathen/04054a.htm">Cletus</a>], xii; (4) Clement, ix; (5) Evarestus, viii; (6) Alexander, x; (7) <a href="../cathen/14031b.htm">Sixtus</a>, x; (8) Telesophorus, xi; (9) <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a>, iv; (10) <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius</a>, xv; (11) <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>, xi;, (12) Soter, viii; (13) Eleutherius, xv; (14) Victor, x; (15) <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a>, xviii; (16) <a href="../cathen/03183d.htm">Callistus</a>, v; (17) <a href="../cathen/15209a.htm">Urban</a>, viii; (18) <a href="../cathen/12229b.htm"> Pontian</a>, v (Harnack, "Chronologie", I, 152).

<p>We learn from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.22</a>) that in the middle of the second century Hegesippus, the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and that he drew up a list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as far as <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>, the then <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> does not quote his catalogue, but Lightfoot sees ground for holding that we possess it in a passage of Epiphanius (Haer. 27:6), in which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as far as <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> are enumerated. This list of Hegesippus, drawn up less than a century after the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Peter, was he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>, the foundation alike of the Eusebian and Hippolytan catalogues (Clement of Rome I, 325 so.). His view has been accepted by many scholars. Even those who, like Harnack (Chronologie, I, 184 sq.), do not admit that this list is really that of Hegesippus, recognize it as a catalogue of Roman origin and of very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, furnishing testimony independent alike of the Eusebian and Liberian lists.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, long accepted as an authority of the highest value, is now acknowledged to have been originally composed at the beginning of the fifth century, and, as regards the early <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, to be dependent on the "Liberian Catalogue".

<p>In the numbering of the <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a> of St. Peter, certain differences appear in various lists. The two forms <a href="../cathen/01446a.htm">Anacletus</a> and <a href="../cathen/04054a.htm">Cletus</a>, as we have seen, very early occasioned the third <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to be reckoned twice. There are some few cases, also, in which it is still <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether particular <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> should be accounted genuine <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> or <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">intruders</a>, and, according to the view taken by the compiler of the list, they will be included or excluded. In the accompanying list the Stephen immediately following <a href="../cathen/15741b.htm">Zacharias</a> (752) is not numbered, since, though duly elected, he died before his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. At that period the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity was held to be conferred at <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and hence he is excluded from all the early lists. <a href="../cathen/09160b.htm">Leo VIII</a> (963) is included, as the resignation of <a href="../cathen/02428b.htm">Benedict V</a>, though enforced, may have been genuine. <a href="../cathen/02661c.htm">Boniface VII</a> is also ranked as a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, since, in 984 at least, he would seem to have been accepted as such by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The claim of <a href="../cathen/02429b.htm">Benedict X</a> (1058) is likewise recognized. It cannot be affirmed that his title was certainly invalid, and his name, though now sometimes excluded, appears in the older catalogues.

<p>It should be observed that there is no John XX in the catalogue. This is due to the fact that, in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, two <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a> are given in connexion with the life of <a href="../cathen/08427b.htm">John XIV</a> (983). This introduced confusion into some of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> catalogues, and a separate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was assigned to each of these <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dates</a>. Thus three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> named John were made to appear between <a href="../cathen/02428d.htm">Benedict VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> led the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of the thirteenth century who should have been called John XX to style himself <a href="../cathen/08429c.htm">John XXI</a> (Duchesne, "Lib. Pont." 2:17).

<p>Some only of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a> find mention in the list. No useful purpose would be served by giving the name of every such claimant. Many of them possess no historical importance whatever. From <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> onward not merely the years but the precise days are assigned on which the respective reigns commenced and closed. Ancient authorities furnish these details in the case of most of the foregoing <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> also: but, previously to the middle of the eleventh century, the information is of uncertain value. With <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> a new method of reckoning came in. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity was held to be conferred by the election, and not as previously by the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>, and the commencement of the reign was computed from the day of election. This point seems therefore a convenient one at which to introduce the more detailed indications.
