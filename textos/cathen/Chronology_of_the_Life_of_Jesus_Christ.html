<h1>Chronology of the Life of Jesus Christ</h1>  

<p>In the following paragraphs we shall endeavour to establish the absolute and relative <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> life, i.e. we shall show first how certain facts connected with the history of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> fit in with the course of universal history, and secondly how the rest of the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> must be arranged according to the inter-relation of its single elements.
<h2 id="section1">Absolute chronology</h2>

<p>The incidents whose absolute <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> may be determined with more or less probability are the year of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> nativity, of the beginning of His public life, and of His death. As we cannot fully examine the data entering into these several problems, the reader ought to compare what has been said on these points in the article <a href="../cathen/03731a.htm">B<font size=-2>IBLICAL</font> C<font size=-2>HRONOLOGY</font></a>.
<h3 id="A">The Nativity</h3>

<p><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#vrs1">St. Matthew (2:1)</a> tells us that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born "in the days of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">King Herod</a>". <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Ant., XVII, viii, 1) informs us that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> died after ruling thirty four years <em>de facto</em>, thirty seven years <em>de jure</em>. Now <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was made rightful king of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 714, while he began his actual rule after taking <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 717. As the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> reckoned their years from Nisan to Nisan, and counted fractional parts as an entire year, the above data will place the death of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> in <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 749, 750, 751. Again, <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> tells us from that an eclipse of the moon occurred not long before <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> death; such an eclipse occurred from 12 to 13 March, <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 750, so that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> must have died before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> of that year which fell on 12 April (<a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, "Ant"., iv, 4; viii, 4). As <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">children</a> up to two years old, in order to destroy the new born King of the <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">Jews</a>, we are led to believe that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> may have been born <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 747, 748, 749. The enrollment under Cyrinus mentioned by <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> in connection with the nativity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and the remarkable <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> conjunction of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn in Pisces, in the spring of <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 748, will not lead us to any more definite result.
<h3 id="B">Beginning of the public ministry</h3>

<p>The date of the beginning of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> ministry may be calculated from three different data found respectively in <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs23">Luke 3:23</a>; <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, "Bel. Jud." I, xxi, 1; or "Ant.", XV, ii, 1; and <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs1">Luke 3:1</a>.

<p>The first of these passages reads: "And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> himself was beginning about the age of thirty years". The phrase "was beginning" does not qualify the following expression "about the age of thirty years", but rather indicates the commencement of the public life. As we have found that the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> falls within the period 747-749 <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font>, His public life must begin about 777-779 <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font>

<p>Second, when, shortly before the first <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a> of His public life, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had cast the buyers and sellers out of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: "Six and forty years was this <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple</a> in building" (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#vrs20">John 2:20</a>). Now, according to the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (loc. cit.), the building of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a> began in the fifteenth year of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> actual reign or in the eighteenth of his reign <em>de jure</em>, i.e. 732 <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font>; hence, adding the forty six years of actual building, the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> first year of public life must have fallen in 778 <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font>

<p>Third, the <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs1">Gospel of St. Luke (3:1)</a> assigns the beginning of St. John the Baptist's mission to the "fifteenth year of the <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius Caesar</a>". <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, the predecessor of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, died 19 August, 767 <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font>, so that the fifteenth year of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius's</a> independent reign is 782 <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font>; but then <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> began to be associate of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> in <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 764, so that the fifteenth year reckoned from this date falls in <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 778. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ's</a> public life began a few months later, i.e. about <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 779.
<h3 id="C">The year of the death of Christ</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> suffered under the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a> (<font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 772-90, or A.D. 18-36), during the governorship of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 780-90). But this leaves the time rather indefinite. Tradition, the patristic testimonies for which have been collected by <a href="../cathen/11559a.htm">Patrizi</a> (De Evangeliis), places the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the fifteenth (or sixteenth) year of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, in the consulship of the Gemini, forty-two years before the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and twelve years before the preaching of the Gospel to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. We have already seen that the fifteenth year of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> is either 778 or 782, according to its computation from the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius's</a> associate or sole reign; the consulship of the Gemini (Fufius and Rubellius) fell in <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 782; the forty second year before the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> is A.D. 29, or <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 782, twelve years before the preaching of the Gospel to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> brings us to the same year, A.D. 29 or <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 782, since the conversion of <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a>, which marks the opening of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> missions, fell probably in A.D. 40 or 41.
<h3 id="D">The day of the death of Christ</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died on Friday, the fifteenth day of Nisan. That He died on Friday is clearly stated by <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs42">Mark 15:42</a>, <a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs54">Luke 23:54</a>, and <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs31">John 19:31</a>. The few writers who assign another day for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death are practically lost in the multitude of authorities who place it on Friday. What is more, they do not even agree among themselves: Epiphanius, e.g., places the Crucifixion on Tuesday; Lactantius, on Saturday; Westcott, on Thursday; <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> and <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, not on Friday.

<p>The first three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> are equally clear about the date of the Crucifixion. They place the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> on the fourteenth day of Nisan, as may be seen from <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs17">Matthew 26:17-20</a>, <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs12">Mark 14:12-17</a> and <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs7">Luke 22:7-14</a>. Nor can there be any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John's</a> agreement with the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptic Evangelists</a> on the question of the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> and the Crucifixion. The supper was held "before the festival day of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs1">John 13:1</a>), i.e. on 14 Nisan, as may be seen from <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs7">Matthew 22:7-14</a>. Nor can there be any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John's</a> agreement with the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptic Evangelists</a> on the question of the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> and the Crucifixion. The <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Supper</a> was held "before the festival day of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs1">John 13:1</a>), i.e. on 14 Nisan, since the sacrificial day was computed according to the Roman method (Jovino, 123 sqq., 139 sqq.).


<p>Again, some disciples thought that <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> left the supper table because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had said to him: "Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day: or that he should give something to the poor" (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs29">John 13:29</a>). If the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Supper</a> had been held on 13 Nisan this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the disciples can hardly be understood, since <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> might have made his purchases and distributed his <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> on 14 Nisan; there would have been no need for his rushing into the city in the middle of the night. On the day of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Crucifixion</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> "went not into the hall, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs28">John 18:28</a>). The <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> wished to eat could not have been the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">paschal lamb</a>, which was eaten on 14 Nisan, for the pollution contracted by entering the hall would have ceased at sundown, so that it would not have prevented them from sharing in the paschal supper. The <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had in view must have been the sacrificial offerings (<em>Chagighah</em>), which were called also <em>pasch</em> and were eaten on 15 Nisan. Hence this passage places the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> on the fifteenth day of Nisan.

<p>Again, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is said to have suffered and died on the "parasceve of the pasch", or simply on the "parasceve" (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs14">John 19:14, 31</a>); as "parasceve" meant Friday, the expression "parasceve" denotes Friday on which the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> happened to fall, not the before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>. Finally, the day following the <a href="../cathen/11476a.htm">parasceve</a> on which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died is called "a great <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath day</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs31">John 19:31</a>), either to denote its occurrence in the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">paschal</a> week or to distinguish it from the preceding <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, or day of minor rest.
<h2 id="section2">Relative chronology</h2>

<p>No student of the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> will question the chronological order of its principal divisions: infancy, hidden life, public life, <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>, glory. But the order of events in the single divisions is not always clear beyond dispute.
<h3 id="A">The infancy of Jesus</h3>

<p>The history of the infancy, for instance, is recorded only in the First Gospel and in the Third. Each Evangelist contents himself with five pictures:

<ul><li>St. Matthew describes the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, the flight into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the slaughter of the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a>, and the return to <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. <li>St. Luke gives a sketch of the birth, of the adoration of the shepherds, of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, of the purification of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>, and of the return to <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>.</ul>

<p>The two <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> agree in the first and the last of these two series of incidents (moreover, all scholars place the birth, adoration of the shepherds, and the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> before the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>), but how are we to arrange the intervening three events related by St. Matthew with the order of St. Luke? We indicate a few of the many ways in which the chronological sequence of these facts has been arranged.

<h4 id="i">First possibility</h4>
<!--<h4 id="i">The birth, the adoration of the shepherds, the circumcision, the adoration of the Magi, the flight into Egypt, the slaughter of the Innocents, the purification, the return to Nazareth</h4>-->

<p>This order implies that either the purification was delayed beyond the fortieth day, which seems to contradict <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs22">Luke 2:22 sqq.</a>, or that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born shortly before <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> death. so that the Holy Family could return from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> within forty days after the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Tradition does not seem to favour this speedy return.

<h4 id="ii">Second possibility</h4>
<!--<h4 id="ii">The birth, the adoration of the shepherds, the circumcision, the adoration of the Magi, the purification, the flight into Egypt, the slaughter of the Innocents, the return to Nazareth</h4>-->

<p>According to this order the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> either arrived a few days before the purification or they came on 6 January; but in neither case can we understand why the Holy Family should have offered the sacrifice of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, after receiving the offerings of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. Moreover, the first Evangelist intimates that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appeared to St. Joseph soon after the departure of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, and it is not at all probable that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> should have waited long before inquiring concerning the whereabouts of the new born king. The difficulties are not overcome by placing the adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> on the day before the purification; it would be more unlikely in that case that the Holy Family should offer the sacrifice of the poor.

<h4 id="iii">Third possibility</h4>

<p>As <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs39">Luke 2:39</a> appears to exclude the possibility of placing the adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> between the presentation and return to <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, there are interpreters who have located the advent of the wise men, the flight to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the slaughter of the Innocents, and the return from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> after the events as told in St. Luke. They agree in the opinion that the Holy Family returned to <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> after the purification, and then left <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> in order to make their home in <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Epiphanius, and some other ancient writers are willing to place the adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> about two years after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth; Paperbroch and his followers allow about a year and thirteen days between the birth and the advent of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>; while <a href="../cathen/11559a.htm">Patrizi</a> agrees with those who fix the advent of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> at about two weeks after the purification. The text of <a href="../bible/mat002.htm#vrs1">Matthew 2:1-2</a> hardly permits an interval of more than a year between the purification and the coming of the wise men; <a href="../cathen/11559a.htm">Patrizi's</a> opinion appears to satisfy all the data furnished by the gospels, while it does not contradict the particulars added by tradition.
<h3 id="B">The hidden life of Jesus</h3>

<p>It was in the seclusion of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spent the greatest part of His earthly life. The <a href="../bible/index.html">inspired records</a> are very reticent about this period: <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs40">Luke 2:40-52</a>; <a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs3">Mark 6:3</a>; <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs42">John 6:42</a>; <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#vrs15">7:15</a>, are about the only passages which refer to the hidden life.

<p>Some of them give us a general view of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life: "The child grew, and grew in strength and wisdom; and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> was in him" is the brief summary of the years following the return of the Holy Family after the ceremonial purification in the Temple. "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men", and He "was subject to them" form the inspired outline of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life in <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> after He had attained the age of twelve.

<p>"When he was twelve years old" <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> accompanied His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to Jerusalem, 'according to the custom of the feast'; When they returned, the child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> remained in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not." After three days, they found him in the Temple, sitting in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, hearing them, and asking them questions." It was on this occasion that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> spoke the only words that have come down from the period of His hidden life: "How is it that you sought me? Did you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that I must be about my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father's</a> business [or, "in my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father's</a> house"]?"

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> tell us that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had not passed through the training of the Rabbinic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>: "How doth this man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> letters, having never learned?". The same question is asked by the people of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, who add, "Is not this the carpenter?" <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> is authority for the statement that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> specially made "ploughs and yokes' (Contra Tryph., 88). Though it is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> existed in the Jewish villages, it may be inferred from the Gospels that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> how to read (<a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs16">Luke 4:16</a>) and write (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#vrs6">John 8:6</a>). At an early age He must have learned the so called <em>Shema</em> (<a href="../bible/deu006.htm#vrs4">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>), and the <em>Hallel</em>, or Psalms 113-118 (Hebrew); He must have been familiar with the other parts of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> too, especially the <a href="../bible/psa000.htm">Psalms</a> and the Prophetic Books, as He constantly refers to them in His public life. It is also asserted that Palestine at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was practically bilingual, so that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> must have spoken Aramaic and Greek; the indications that He was acquainted with Hebrew and Latin are rather slight. The public teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> shows that He was a close observer of the sights and sounds of nature, and of the habits of all classes of men. For these are the usual sources of His illustrations.

<p>To conclude, the hidden life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> extending through thirty years is far different from what one should have expected in the case of a Person Who is adored by His followers as their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and revered as their Saviour; this is an indirect <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for the credibility of the Gospel story.
<h3 id="C">The public life of Jesus: its duration</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> of the public life offers a number of problems to the interpreter; we shall touch upon only two, the duration of the public life, and the successive journeys it contains.

<p>There are two extreme views as to the length of the ministry of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: St. Iren&aelig;us (<a href="../fathers/0103222.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> II.22.3-6</a>) appears to suggest a period of fifteen years; the prophetic phrases, "the year of recompenses", "the year of my <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>" (<a href="../bible/isa034.htm#vrs8">Isaiah 34:8</a>; <a href="../bible/isa063.htm#vrs4">63:4</a>), appear to have induced <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a>, <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">Philastrius</a>, <a href="../cathen/07347a.htm">Hilarion</a>, and two or three other <a href="../cathen/11560a.htm">patristic</a> writers to allow only one year for the public life. This latter opinion has found advocates among certain recent students: von Soden, for instance, defends it in Cheyne's "Encyclopaedia Biblica". But the text of the Gospels demands a more extensive duration. <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John's Gospel</a> distinctly mentions three distinct paschs in the history of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> ministry (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#vrs13">2:13</a>; <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs4">6:4</a>; <a href="../bible/joh011.htm#vrs55">11:55</a>). The first of the three occurs shortly after the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the last coincides with His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, so that at least two years must have intervened between the two events to give us the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> room for the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">passover</a> mentioned in <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs4">6:4</a>. Westcott and Hort omit the expression "the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>" in <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs4">6:4</a> to compress the ministry of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> within the space of one year; but all the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, the versions, and nearly all the Fathers testify for the reading <em>"En de eggysto pascha heeorteton Ioudaion"</em>: "Now the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, the festival day of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, was near at hand". Thus far then everything tends to favour the view of those writers and more recent <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentators</a> who extend the period of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> ministry a little over two years.

<p>But a comparison of <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John's Gospel</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptic Evangelists</a> seems to introduce another <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, indicated in the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a>, into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> public life. <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#vrs45">John 4:45</a>, relates the return of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> after the first <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> of His public life in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the same event is told by <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs14">Mark 1:14</a>, and <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs14">Luke 4:14</a>. Again the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> mentioned in <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs4">John 6:4</a> has its parallel in the "green grass" of <a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs39">Mark 6:39</a>, and in the multiplication of loaves as told in <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs12">Luke 9:12 sqq.</a> But the plucking of ears mentioned in <a href="../bible/mar002.htm#vrs23">Mark 2:23</a>, and <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs1">Luke 6:1</a>, implies another paschal season intervening between those expressly mentioned in <a href="../bible/joh002.htm">John 2:13</a> and <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs4">6:4</a>. This shows that the public life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> must have extended over four paschs, so that it must have lasted three years and a few months. Though the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> does not indicate this fourth <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> as clearly as the other three, it is not wholly silent on the question. The "festival day of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>" mentioned in <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs1">John 5:1</a>, has been identified with the Feast of Pentecost, the <a href="../cathen/14425a.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a>, the Feast of Expiation, the Feast of the New Moon, the Feast of Purim, the Feast of Dedication, by various commentators; others openly confess that they cannot determine to which of the Jewish feasts this festival day refers. Nearly all difficulties will disappear if the festival day be regarded as the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>, as both the text (<em>heorte</em>) and <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#vrs35">John 4:35</a> seem to demand (cf. Dublin Review, XXIII, 351 sqq.).
<h3 id="D">The public life of Jesus: his journeys</h3>

<p>The journeys made during His public life may be grouped under nine heads: the first six were mainly performed in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and had Capharnaum for their central point; the last three bring <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> into <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> without any pronounced central point. We cannot enter into the disputed questions connected with the single incidents of the various groups.

<h4 id="i">First journey</h4>

<p>December, <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 778 - Spring, 779. (Cf. <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs2">John 1:2</a>; <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs4">Matthew 3:4</a>; <a href="../bible/mar001.htm">Mark 1</a>; <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs4">Luke 3:4</a>) <br><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> abandons His hidden life in <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, and goes to <a href="../cathen/02532a.htm">Bethania</a> across the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, where He is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John and receives the Baptist's first testimony to His Divine mission. He then withdraws into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, where He <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> for forty days and is tempted by the devil. After this He dwells in the neighbourhood of the Baptist's ministry, and receives the latter's second and third testimony; here too He wins His first disciples, with whom He journeys to the wedding feast at Cana in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, where He performs His first <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. Finally He transfers His residence, so far as there can be question of a residence in His public life, to Capharnaum, one of the principal thoroughfares of commerce and travel in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.

<h4 id="ii">Second journey</h4>

<p>Passover, <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 779 - about Pentecost, 780. (Cf. <a href="../bible/joh002.htm">John 2</a>-<a href="../bible/joh005.htm">5</a>; <a href="../bible/mar001.htm">Mark 1</a>-<a href="../bible/mar003.htm">3</a>; <a href="../bible/luk004.htm">Luke 4</a>-<a href="../bible/luk007.htm">7</a>; <a href="../bible/mat004.htm">Matthew 4</a>-<a href="../bible/mat009.htm">9</a>) <br><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> goes from Capharnaum to Jerusalem for the Feast of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>; here he expels the buyers and sellers from the Temple, and is questioned by the Jewish authorities. Many believed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and Nicodemus came to converse with Him during the night. After the festival days He remained in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> till about the following December, during which period He received the fourth testimony from John who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> at <a href="../cathen/01173b.htm">Ennon</a> (A.V. Aenon). When the Baptist had been <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in Machaerus, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> by way of Samaria where He met the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> at Jacob's well near Sichar; He delayed two days in this place, and many believed in Him.

<p>Soon after His return into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> we find <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> again in Cana, where He heard the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> who pleaded for the recovery of his dying son in Capharnaum. The rejection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> by the people of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, whether at this time as, St. Luke intimates, or at a later period, as St. Mark seems to demand, or again both now and about eight months later, is an <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> problem we cannot solve here. At any rate, shortly afterwards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is mostly actively engaged in Capharnaum in teaching and healing the sick, restoring among others Peter's mother-in-law and a demoniac. On this occasion He called Peter and Andrew, James and John. Then followed a missionary tour through <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> during which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> cured a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>; soon he again taught in Capharnaum, and was surrounded by such a multitude that a man sick of the palsy had to be let down through the roof in order to reach the Sacred Presence. After calling Matthew to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostleship</a>, He went to Jerusalem for the second <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> occurring during His public life, it was on this occasion that He healed the man who been sick for thirty-eight years near the pool at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The charge of violating the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> answer were the natural effects of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. The same charge is repeated shortly after the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a>; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had returned to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and the disciples plucked some ripe ears in the corn fields. The question became more acute in the immediate future; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had returned to Capharnaum, and there healed on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> day a man who had a withered hand. The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> now make common cause with the Herodians in order to "destroy him". <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> withdraws first to the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Sea of Galilee</a>, where He teaches and performs numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; then retires to the <a href="../cathen/02369a.htm">Mountain of Beatitudes</a>, where He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> during the night, chooses His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a> in the morning, and preaches the Sermon on the Mount. He is brought back to Capharnaum by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> who asks and obtains the of his servant.

<h4 id="iii">Third journey</h4>

<p>About Pentecost, <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 780- Autumn, 780. (Cf. <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs8">Luke 7:8</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs4">Mark 3:4</a>; <a href="../bible/mat004.htm">Matthew 4</a>, <a href="../bible/mat008.htm">8</a>, <a href="../bible/mat009.htm">9</a>, <a href="../bible/mat012.htm">12</a>, <a href="../bible/mat013.htm">13</a>) <br><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> makes another missionary tour through <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; He resuscitates the son of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> at Naim, and shortly afterwards receives the messengers sent by John from his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in Machaerus. Then follows the scene of the merciful reception of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who anoints the feet of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> while He rests at table in <a href="../cathen/09523a.htm">Magdala</a> or perhaps in Capharnaum; for the rest of His missionary tour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is followed by a band of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who minister to the wants of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. After returning to Capharnaum, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> expels the mute devil, is charged by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> with casting out devils by the prince of devils, and encounters the remonstrances of His <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">kinsmen</a>. Withdrawing to the sea, He preaches what may be called the "Lake Sermon", consisting of seven parables.

<h4 id="iv">Fourth journey</h4>

<p>Autumn, <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 780- about <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, 781. (Cf. <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs9">Luke 8:9</a>; <a href="../bible/mar004.htm">Mark 4</a>-<a href="../bible/mar006.htm">6</a>; <a href="../bible/mat008.htm">Matthew 8</a>, <a href="../bible/mat009.htm">9</a>, <a href="../bible/mat010.htm">10</a>, <a href="../bible/mat013.htm">13</a>, <a href="../bible/mat014.htm">14</a>) <br>After a laborious day of ministry in the city of Capharnaum and on the lake, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> with His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> crosses the waters. As a great storm overtakes them, the frightened Apostles awaken their sleeping <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a>, Who commands the winds and the waves. Towards morning they meet in the country of the <a href="../cathen/06469a.htm">Gerasens</a>, on the east of the lake, two demoniacs. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">expels</a> the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, but allows them to enter into a herd of swine. The beasts destroy themselves in the waters of the lake, and frightened inhabitants beg <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> not to remain among them. After returning to Capharnaum he heals the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had touched the <a href="../cathen/06307b.htm">hem</a> of His garment, resuscitates the daughter of Jairus, and gives sight to two blind men. The second Gospel places here <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> last visit to and rejection by the people of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. Then follows the ministry of the Apostles who are sent two by two, while <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Himself makes another missionary tour through <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. It seems to have been the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> that occasioned the return of the Apostles and their gathering around the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a> in Capharnaum. But, however depressing this event may have been, it did not damp the enthusiasm of the Apostles over their success.

<h4 id="v">Fifth journey</h4>

<p>Spring, <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 781. (Cf. <a href="../bible/joh006.htm">John 6</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm">Luke 9</a>; <a href="../bible/mar006.htm">Mark 6</a>; and <a href="../bible/mat014.htm">Matthew 14</a>) <br><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> invites the Apostles, tired out from their missionary labours, to rest awhile. They cross the northern part of the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Sea of Galilee</a>, but, instead of finding the desired solitude, they are met by multitudes of people who had preceded them by land or by boat, and who were eager for instruction. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> taught them throughout the day, and towards evening did not wish to dismiss them hungry. On the other hand, there were only five loaves and two fishes at the disposal of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; after His blessing, these scanty supplies satisfied the hunger of five thousand men, besides <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, and remnants filled twelve baskets of fragments. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> sent the Apostles back to their boats, and escaped from the enthusiastic multitudes, who wished to make Him king, into the mountain where He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> till far into the night. Meanwhile the Apostles were facing a contrary wind till the fourth watch in the morning, when they saw <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> walking upon the waters. The Apostles first fear, and then recognize <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; Peter walks upon the water as long as his confidence lasts; the storm ceases when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> has entered the boat. The next day brings <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to Capharnaum, where He speaks to the assembly about the Bread of Life and promises the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, with the result that some of His followers leave Him, while the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> disciples is strengthened.

<h4 id="vi">Sixth journey</h4>

<p>About May, <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 781- Sept., 781. (Cf. <a href="../bible/luk009.htm">Luke 9</a>; <a href="../bible/mar007.htm">Mark 7-9</a>; <a href="../bible/mat014.htm">Matthew 14-18</a>; <a href="../bible/joh007.htm">John 7</a>) <br>It may be owing to the enmity stirred up against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> by His Eucharistic discourse in Capharnaum that He began now a more extensive missionary tour than He had made in the preceding years of His life. Passing through the country of Genesar, He expressed His disapproval of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisaic</a> practices of <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">legal purity</a>. Within the boarders of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon He <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcized</a> the daughter of the Syrophoenician <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. From here <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> travelled first towards the north, then towards the east, then south-eastward through the northern part of Decapolis, probably along the foot of the Lebanon, till He came to the eastern part of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. While in Decapolis <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> healed a deaf-mute, employing a ceremonial more elaborate than He had used at any of His previous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; in the eastern part of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, probably not far from Dalmanutha and Magedan, He fed four thousand men, besides children and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with seven loaves and a few little fishes, the remaining fragments filling seven baskets. The multitudes had listened for three days to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, previously to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. In spite of the many cures performed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, during this journey, on the blind, the dumb, the lame, the maimed, and on many others, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and Sadducees asked Him for a sign from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, tempting Him. He promised them the sign of Jonas the Prophet. After <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the Apostles had crossed the lake, He warned them to beware of the leaven of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>; then they passed through Bethsaida Julias where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> gave sight to a blind man. Next we find <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the confines of <a href="../cathen/03135a.htm">Caesarea Philippi</a>, where Peter professes his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of the living God</a>, and in his turn receives from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the promise of the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> here predicts His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>, and about a week later is transfigured before Peter, James, and John, probably on the top of <a href="../cathen/14551a.htm">Mt.Thabor</a>. On descending from the mountain, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcizes</a> the mute devil whom His disciples had not been able to expel. Bending his way towards Capharnaum, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> predicts His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> for the second time, and in the city pays the tribute-money for Himself and Peter. This occasions the discussion as to the greater in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and the allied discourses. Finally, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> refuses His brethren's invitation to go publicly to the <a href="../cathen/14425a.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a> in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<h4 id="vii">Seventh journey</h4>

<p>Sept., <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 781- December, 781. (Cf. <a href="../bible/luk009.htm">Luke 9-13</a>; <a href="../bible/mar010.htm">Mark 10</a>; <a href="../bible/mat006.htm">Matthew 6</a>, <a href="../bible/mat007.htm">7</a>, <a href="../bible/mat008.htm">8</a>, <a href="../bible/mat010.htm">10</a>, <a href="../bible/mat011.htm">11</a>, <a href="../bible/mat012.htm">12</a>, <a href="../bible/mat024.htm">24</a>; <a href="../bible/joh007.htm">John 7-10</a>) <br><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> now "steadfastly set His face to go Jerusalem", and as the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> refused Him hospitality, He had to take the east of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>. While still in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, He refused the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">discipleship</a> of several half-hearted candidates, and about the same time He sent other seventy-two, two by two, before His face into every city and place whither He Himself was to come. Probably in the lower part of Peraea, the seventy-two returned with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, rejoicing in the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miraculous power</a> that had been exercised by them. It must have been in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answered the lawyer's question, "Who is my neighbour?" by the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the Good <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>. Next <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was received in the hospitable home of Mary and Martha, where He declares Mary to have chosen the better part. From Bethania He went to Jerusalem for the <a href="../cathen/14425a.htm">Feast of Tabernacles</a>, where he became involved in discussions with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The Scribes and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> endeavoured to catch Him in the sentence which they asked Him to pronounce in the case of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> taken in adultery. When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had avoided this snare, He continued His discussions with the hostile <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Their enmity was intensified because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> restored sight to a blind man on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> appears to have His stay in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> with the beautiful discourse on the Good Shepherd. A little later He teaches His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a>, probably somewhere on Mt. Olivet. On a subsequent missionary tour through <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and Peraea He defends Himself against the charges of <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and reproves their <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>. On the same journey <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> warned against <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, worldly care; He exhorted to watchfulness, patience under contradictions, and to penance. About this time, too, He healed the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had the spirit of infirmity.

<h4 id="viii">Eighth journey</h4>

<p>December, <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 781-February, 782. (Cf. <a href="../bible/luk013.htm">Luke 13</a>-<a href="../bible/luk017.htm">17</a>; <a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs11">John 10:11</a>) <br>The <a href="../cathen/04673b.htm">Feast of Dedication</a> brought <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> again to Jerusalem, and occasioned another discussion with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. This is followed by another missionary tour through Peraea, during which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> explained a number of important points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>: the number of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, the choice of one's place at table, the guests to be invited, the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the great supper, resoluteness in the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the parables of the hundred sheep, the lost groat, and the prodigal son, of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> steward, of Dives and Lazarus, of the unmerciful servant, besides the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of fraternal correction, and the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. During this period, too, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> attempted to frighten <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> with the menance of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; on his part, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> healed a man who had dropsy, on a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, while at table in the house of a certain prince of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. Finally Mary and Martha send messengers to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, asking Him to come and cure their brother Lazarus; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went after two days, and resuscitated His friend who had been several days in the grave. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are exasperated over this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and they decree <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> must die for the people. Hence He withdrew "into a country near the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, unto a city that is called Ephrem".

<h4 id="ix">Ninth journey</h4>

<p>February, <font size=-2>A.U.C.</font> 782- <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, 782. (Cf. <a href="../bible/luk017.htm">Luke 17</a>-<a href="../bible/luk022.htm">22</a>; <a href="../bible/mar010.htm">Mark 10</a>, <a href="../bible/mar014.htm">14</a>; <a href="../bible/mat019.htm">Matthew 19</a>-<a href="../bible/mat026.htm">26</a>; <a href="../bible/joh011.htm">John 11</a>, <a href="../bible/joh012.htm">12</a>.) <br>This last journey took <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from Ephrem northward through Samaria, then eastward along the border of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> into Peraea, then southward through Peraea, westward across the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, Bethania on Mt. Olivet, Bethphage, and finally to Jerusalem. While in the most northern part of the journey, He cured ten <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>; a little later, He answered the questions raised by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. Then He urged the need of incessant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by proposing the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judge; here too belong the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">Publican</a>, the discourse on marriage, on the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> towards the children, on the right use of riches as illustrated by the story of the rich young ruler, and the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the labourers in the vineyard. After beginning His route towards <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, He predicted His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> for the third time; James and John betray their <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, but they are taught the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> standard of greatness in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. At <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> heals two blind men, and receives the repentance of Zacheus the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>; here He proposed also the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the pounds entrusted to the servants by the master.

<p>Six days before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">pasch</a> we find <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> at Bethania on Mt. Olivet, as the guest of Simon the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>; Mary anoints His feet, and the disciples at the instigation of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> are indignant at this seeming waste of ointment. A great multitude assembles at Bethania, not to see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> only but also Lazarus; hence the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> think of killing Lazarus too. On the following day <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> solemnly entered <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and was received by the <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> cries of all classes of people. In the afternoon He met a delegation of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in the court of the Temple. On Monday <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> curses the barren fig tree, and during the morning He drives the buyers and sellers from the Temple. On Tuesday the wonder of the disciples at the sudden withering of the fig tree provokes their <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master's</a> instruction on the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> answers the enemies' questions as to His authority; then He proposes the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the two sons, of the wicked husbandmen, and of the marriage feast. Next follows a triple snare: the politicians ask whether it is lawful to pay tribute to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Caesar</a>; the scoffers inquire whose wife a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who has had several husbands, will be after resurrection; the Jewish <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> propose the question: Which is the first commandment, the great commandment of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>? Then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> proposes His last question to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: "What think you of <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>? whose son is he?" This is followed by the eightfold woe against the Scribes and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and by the denunciation of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The last words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the Temple were expressions of praise for the poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who had made an offering of two mites in spite of her poverty. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> ended this day by uttering the prophecies concerning the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, His second coming, and the future judgement; these predictions are interrupted by the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the ten virgins and the talents. On Wednesday <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> again predicted His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>; probably it was on the same day that <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> made his agreement with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to betray <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.
<h3 id="E">The Passion of Jesus: its preparation</h3>

<p>The history of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> comprises three parts: the preparation for the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, the trial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and His death.

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> prepares His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> for the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, He prepares Himself for the ordeal and His enemies prepare themselves for the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>.

<h4 id="i">Preparation of the apostles</h4>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> prepares His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> for the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> by the eating of the <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">paschal lamb</a>, the institution of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, the concomitant ceremonies, and His lengthy discourses held during and after the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>. Special mention should be made of the prediction of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, and of the betrayal one of the Apostles and the denial by another. Peter, James, and John are prepared in a more particular manner by witnessing the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> on Mt. Olivet.

<h4 id="ii">Preparation of Jesus</h4>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> must have found an indirect preparation in all He did and said to strengthen His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. But the preparation that was peculiarly His own consisted in His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06540a.htm">grotto of His Agony</a> where the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came to strengthen Him. The sleep of His favoured Apostles during the hours of His bitter struggle must have prepared Him too for the complete abandonment He was soon to experience.

<h4 id="iii">Preparation of the enemies</h4>

<p><a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> leaves the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Master</a> during the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>. The chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> hastily collect a detachment of the Roman cohort stationed in the castle of Antonia, of the Jewish temple-watch, and of the officials of the Temple. To these are added a number of the servants and dependents of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>, and a miscellaneous multitude of fanatics with lanterns and torches, with swords and clubs, who were to follow the leadership of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>. They took <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, bound Him, and led Him to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest's</a> house.
<h3 id="F">The Passion of Jesus: the trial</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was tried first before an ecclesiastical and then before a civil tribunal.

<h4 id="i">Before ecclesiastical court</h4>

<p>The ecclesiastical trial includes <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> appearance before Annas, before <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>, and again before <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>, who appears to have acted in each case as head of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>. The Jewish court found <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> guilty of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and condemned Him to death, though its proceedings were illegal from more than one point of view. During the trial took place Peter's triple denial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is insulted and mocked, especially between the second and third session; and after His final condemnation <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despaired</a> and met his tragic death.

<h4 id="ii">Before the civil court</h4>

<p>The civil trial, too, comprised three sessions, the first before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, the second before <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, the third again before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is not charged with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> before the court of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, but with stirring up the people, forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and claiming to be <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ the king</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> ignores the first two charges; the third he finds harmless when he sees that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> does not claim royalty in the Roman sense of the word.

<p>But in order not to incur the odium of the Jewish leaders, the Roman governor sends his prisoner to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>. As <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did not humour the curiosity of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, He was mocked and set at naught by the Tetrarch of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and his court, and sent back to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>.

<p>The Roman <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> declares the prisoner innocent for the second time, but, instead of setting Him free, gives the people the alternative to choose either <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> or Barabbas for their paschal freedman. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> pronounced <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> innocent for the third time with the more solemn <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of washing his hands; he had recourse to a third scheme of ridding himself of the burden of pronouncing an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> sentence against his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. He had the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> scourged, thus annihilating, as far as human means could do so, any hope that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> could ever attain to the royal dignity. But even this device miscarried, and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> allowed his political <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> to prevail over his sense of evident <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; he condemned <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to be crucified.
<h3 id="G">The Passion of Jesus: his death</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> carried His Cross to the place of execution. Simon of Cyrene is forced to assist Him in bearing the heavy burden. On the way <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> addresses his last words to the weeping <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who sympathized with His suffering. He is nailed to the Cross, his garments are divided, and an inscription is placed over His head. While His enemies mock Him, He pronounces the well-known "Seven Words". Of the two robbers crucified with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, one was converted, and the other died impenitent. The sun was darkened, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> surrendered His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into the hands of His Father. The veil of the Temple was rent into two, the earth quaked, the rocks were riven, and many bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that had slept arose and appeared to many. The Roman <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> testified that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was indeed the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Heart of Jesus</a> was pierced so as to make sure of His death. The Sacred Body was taken from the Cross by <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a> and Nicodemus, and was buried in the new sepulchre of Joseph, and the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> drew near.
<h3 id="H">The glory of Jesus</h3>

<p>After the burial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the holy <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> returned and prepared spices and ointments. The next day, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> made the sepulchre secure with guards, sealing the stone. When the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was passed, the holy <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> brought sweet spices that they might anoint <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> rose early the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">first day of the week</a>, and there was a great earthquake, and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> descended from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and rolled back the stone. The guards were struck with terror, and became as dead men. On arriving at the sepulchre the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> found the grave empty; <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> ran to tell the Apostles Peter and John, while the other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were told by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> had arisen from the dead. Peter and John hasten to the sepulchre, and find everything as <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a> has reported. <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a> too returns, and, while weeping at the sepulchre, is approached by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">arisen Saviour</a> Who appears to her and speaks with her. On the same day <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> appeared to the other holy women, to Peter, to the two disciples on their way to <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>, and to all the Apostles excepting Thomas. A week later He appeared to all the Apostles, Thomas included; later still He appeared in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> near the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake of Genesareth</a> to seven disciples, on a mountain in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to a multitude of disciples, to James, and finally to His disciples on the Mount Olivet whence He <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into heaven</a>. But these apparitions do not exhaust the record of the Gospels, according to which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> showed Himself alive after His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> by many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, for forty days appearing to the disciples and speaking of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.
