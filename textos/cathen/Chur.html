<h1>Chur</h1>  

<p>(Anciently C<font size=-2>URIA</font> R<font size=-2>H&#198;TORUM,</font> in Italian C<font size=-2>OIRA,</font> French C<font size=-2>O&#207;RE,</font> in the local Romance language C<font size=-2>UERA</font>), D<font size=-2>IOCESE of</font> (C<font size=-2>URIENSIS</font>)

<p>Comprises at present the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Cantons of Graub&uuml;nden (Grisons), Glarus, Z&uuml;rich, Unterwalden, and Uri, as well as the little Principality of Lichtenstein. The city of Chur, the residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and capital of the Canton of Graub&uuml;nden, is very ancient, having once been a Roman fortified camp. Its present population is about 10,000, of which number one-third are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>The first mention of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chur (St. Asimo) is at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, as early as 451 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, IV, 141). The Rt. Rev. John Fidelis Battaglia, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1 March, 1889, is the ninety-sixth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chur. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was at first suffragan to that of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but after the treaty of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> (843) it became suffragan to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. In consequence of political changes it became, in 1803, <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. According to local traditions, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chur was St. Lucius, a reputed King of Britain, who is said to have died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> at Chur about the year 176, and whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. St. Lucius is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as the principal patron of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. (See G. Mayer, "St. Luzi bei Chur", Lindau, 1876.) The country had to pass through very severe struggles for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, King of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a>, and the Lombards after him, attempted to introduce <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> in the sixth and seventh centuries. During the dispute between <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> and <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a>, Bishop Egino of Chur sided with the emperor and was rewarded with the dignity of Prince of the Empire (1170). In later times the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were also temporal lords of the city, and several of them were better warriors than <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. The struggles of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> for liberty in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and, later, the secret preaching of <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, did great harm to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, especially as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> neglected the instruction of the people. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was publicly proclaimed at Chur in 1524, and the two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of St. Martin and St. Regula were given over to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, who retain possession of them to this day. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> fled, and his administrator, Abbot Theodore Schlegel, was publicly beheaded (1 January, 1529). Bishop Thomas Planta, a friend of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, tried, but without success, to suppress <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. He died, probably poisoned, 5 May, 1565. (See Camenisch, "Carlo Borromeo und die Gegenreform im Veltlin", 1901.) Twenty years later <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles</a> sent the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> into the endangered region, but Bishop Peter II (de Rascher) refused to admit them. His successor, Bishop John V (Flugi d'Aspermont, 1601-27), a saintly and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> man, endeavoured to restore the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, but was compelled to flee three times (1607, 1612, and 1617), and for several years a bloody <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was waged between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Finally, the newly erected <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> commissioned the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> to save the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among the people (1621). The first <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> superior of the mission was <a href="../cathen/06069a.htm">St. Fidelis of Sigmaringen</a>, who, on his way from Sewis to Gr&uuml;sch, a little north of Chur, was slain (24 April, 1622) by peasants whom the sermons of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> preachers had wrought up to a fury. Some <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> are preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Chur. A second mission, that of Misocco and Calanca, in the southern part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> in 1635. These two missions (Rh&aelig;ti&aelig; and Mesauci) are at present prefectures Apostolic under the care of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> and the prefects reside at the two cities of Obervatz and Cama, both in the Canton of Grisons.

<p>Several holy and extraordinary men have contributed to the splendour of the Diocese of Chur. Four of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> &mdash; St. Asimo (c. 450), St. Valentinian (530-48), St. Ursicinus (d. 760), and <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a> (1151-60)&mdash;are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; St. Sigisbert flourished about the year 600, St. Pirminus a century later; St. Florian, whom the diocese has chosen as its second patron, lived in the ninth century, the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> St. Gerold in the tenth. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/14578a.htm">Theodosius Florentini</a>, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> from 1860 till his death (15 February, 1865), was a very distinguished missionary; in 1852 he erected the Hospital of the Cross at Chur; before this he had already laid the foundations of two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> religious congregations, one for the instruction of children, the other for the care of the sick. Chur is the birthplace of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Angelica Kauffman.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Chur, which was begun by Bishop Tello (758-73), has a highly interesting <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>; it is built in Romanesque style, and contains remarkable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">D&uuml;rer</a> and <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbein</a>. According to the "Kirchliches Handlexicon" (Munich, 1906) the diocese has a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of about 248,887 (non-Catholics, 431,367). There are 358 secular and 226 religious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in charge of about 201 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, besides many chaplaincies and mission- stations. The largest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community is at Z&uuml;rich (43,655). The 35 <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> of the prefectures Apostolic had charge of 79 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in 1906. Three <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> &mdash; <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, Engelberg, and Disentis&mdash;are within the diocese and, with the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nicolaus von der Flue at Sachseln, are places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. There is an <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> at Chur, besides colleges at Schwyz, Disentis, <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, Engelberg, Sarnen, and Stans. There are in the diocese nine orders of men, ten orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (Franciscans, Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, and others), and eleven congregations.
