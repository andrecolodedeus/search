<h1>Churching of Women</h1>  

<p>A blessing given by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to mothers after recovery from childbirth. Only a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who has given birth to a child in legitimate wedlock, provided she has not allowed the child to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is entitled to it. It is not a precept, but a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and praiseworthy custom (<em>Rituale Romanum</em>), dating from the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ages, for a mother to present herself in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as soon as she is able to leave her house (<a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, First Council of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>), to render thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for her <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> delivery, and to obtain by means of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> blessing the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to bring up her child in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> manner. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> indicate that this blessing is intended solely for the benefit of the mother, and hence it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that she should bring the child with her; nevertheless, in many places the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and edifying custom prevails of specially dedicating the child to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, as the Mother of Christ carried her Child to the Temple to offer Him to the Eternal Father, so a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mother is anxious to present her offspring to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and obtain for it the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This blessing, in the ordinary form, without change or omission, is to be given to the mother, even if her child was stillborn, or has died without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (Cong. Sac. Rit., 19 May, 1896).

<p>The churching of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is not a strictly <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> function, yet the Congregation of Sacred Rites (21 November, 1893) decided that a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, if asked to give it, must do so, and if another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is asked to perform the rite, he may do so in any church or public oratory, provided the superior of said church or oratory be notified. It must be imparted in a church or in a place in which Mass is celebrated, as the very name "churching" is intended to suggest a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of thanksgiving to the church, and as the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> indicate in the expressions: "desires to come to the church", "he conducts her into the church", she kneels before the altar", etc. Hence the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (No. 246) prohibits the practice of churching in places in which Mass is not celebrated.

<p>The mother, kneeling in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a>, or within the church, and carrying a lighted candle, awaits the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who, vested in <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> and white stole, sprinkles her with <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> in the form of a cross. Having recited Psalm 23, "The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof", he offers her the left extremity of the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> and leads her into the church, saying: "Enter thou into the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, adore the Son of the Blessed Virgin Mary who has given thee fruitfulness of offspring." She advances to one of the altars and kneels before it, whilst the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, turned towards her, recites a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which expresses the object of the blessing, and then, having sprinkled her again with <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> in the form of the cross, dismisses her, saying: "The peace and blessing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God Almighty</a>, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, descend upon thee, and remain forever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>."
