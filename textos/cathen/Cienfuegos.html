<h1>Cienfuegos</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of Cienfuegos (Centumfocensis), which includes all the Province of Santa Clara in the central part of <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, has an area of 9,500 square miles and (census of 1899) a population of 356,536; 317,243 native Cubans; 28,398 <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> 10,895 of other nationalities. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which had previously formed part of that of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>, was erected by Archbishop Chapelle, of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, acting as Apostilic-Delgate, in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Actum praeclare" of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (20 February, 1903), but was administered by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Santiago de Cuba until 31 May, 1904, when its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Fray Aureole-Torres y Sanz, O.C.D, took possession.

<p>Missions were established in the cities of Trinidad and Sancti Spiritus, in this part of <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, during the sixteenth century, under <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who preached to the aborigines and continued to keep the spirit of religion alive among the colonists, until the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders by the Spanish Government in 1835. Numberless religious endowments witnesses to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the inhabitants, especially during the eighteen century, when <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> fervor reached its highest pitch; but by far the greater part of these were in time confiscated by the successive Spanish governors. On taking possession of his newly erected see, the first care of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cienfuegos was to introduce order into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration, which had suffered severely from the civil troubles between 1868 and 1895, many of the church building having been irreparably ruined.

<p>Santa Clara is an essentially agricultural district. There are numerous sugar mills, and the province is well supplied with railroads. Most of the immigration is Spanish. Although, the vast majority of the inhabitants are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, it is impossible to obtain contributions for the support of the religion from a populace whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> have been impaired by years of political turmoil. The Cubans, moreover, have for generations been accustomed to a Church supported by the State. On the other hand, while indifferentism and <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> are rife, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> &#151; although represented by several <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> &#151; has few adherents.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains 38 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> only eleven are native Cubans. The religious and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> at Cienfuegos are: Monserrat College, under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, 20 religious, 159 pupils; Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas College, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers, 11 religious, 100 pupils; French College, 6 Marist Brothers, with 80 pupils; College of the Apostolate, 8 Sisters of the Apostolate of the Sacred Heart, with 38 pupils; Huerfanas de la Rosary, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> conducted by the Daughters of the Rosary, 27 boarders and 54 scholars; Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servants of Mary</a>, for the care of the sick in their own homes, 8 sisters and 43 girl pupils in the free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; 9 <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, with 62 inmates of their home for the aged. At Santa Clara there is a College of <a href="../cathen/11590a.htm">Saint Paul of the Cross</a>, <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, 10 religious and 62 pupils; College of the Love of God, 6 Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God, with 56 girl pupils. At Trinidad the "L&iacute;ceo Trinitario" is under the direction of Father of the Order of Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. The few native Cubans in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> who feel called to <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> either make their studies at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Diocese of Havana</a> or enter <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders.
