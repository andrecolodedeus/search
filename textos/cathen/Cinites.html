<h1>Cinites</h1>  

<p>(A.V. Kenites).

<p>A tribe or <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> often mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, personified as <em>Qayin</em> from which the <em>nomen gentilicium Qeni</em> is derived. In spite of several attempts at a solution, the origin both of the name and of the tribe is still obscure. Hobab the relative (brother-in-law?) of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was a Cinite (<a href="../bible/jdg001.htm#vrs16">Judges 1:16</a>, <a href="../bible/jdg004.htm#vrs11">4:11</a>; as Hobab is also called a <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madianite</a> (<a href="../bible/num010.htm#vrs29">Numbers 10:29</a>), it follows that the Cinites belonged to that nation. Judging from appearances, the Cinites were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worshippers of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a>. Some scholars, on the strength of <a href="../bible/exo018.htm">Exodus 18</a>, go even so far as to assert that it was from them that the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> received a great portion of their <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheistic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; the passage, however, deals directly and only with social organization. At any rate, the <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechabites</a>, a clan of the Cinites (<a href="../bible/1ch002.htm#vrs55">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>) were even <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetics</a> and insisted on retaining the nomadic habits of the followers of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> (<a href="../bible/jer035.htm">Jeremiah 35</a>), Though calamities were foretold for the Cinites by <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> (<a href="../bible/num024.htm#vrs21">Numbers 24:21 sqq.</a>), they are always represented as being on friendly terms with the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>. Owing probably to their alliance with Moses and also to the bonds of a common religion, they befriended the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> during their wanderings in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> (<a href="../bible/num010.htm#vrs29">Numbers 10:29-32</a>, <a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#vrs6">1 Samuel 15:6</a>) and joined them in their march on <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> (<a href="../bible/jdg001.htm#vrs16">Judges 1:16</a>). There is no intimation that there ever was any enmity between the two nations (cf. <a href="../bible/1sa027.htm#vrs10">1 Samuel 27:10</a>, <a href="../bible/1sa030.htm#vrs29">30:29</a>). The Cinites dwelt south of Palestine with the Amalecites, as is evident from <a href="../bible/num024.htm#vrs21">Numbers 24:21 sqq.</a>, <a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#vrs6">1 Samuel 15:6</a>, and probably from <a href="../bible/jdg001.htm#vrs16">Judges 1:16</a> if, instead of the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> version, we use an alternate Hebrew reading &#151; a reading which is supported by several Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and by the Sahidic <a href="../cathen/16078c.htm">Coptic Version</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/03766c.htm">Ciasca</a>, Fragm. Copto-Sahidica). One clan of the Cinites left the tribe and settled in the north under Haber, at the time of <a href="../cathen/02281a.htm">Barac</a> and Debbera (<a href="../bible/jdg004.htm#vrs11">Judges 4:11</a>); Jahel, who slew Sisara, was the wife of Haber the Cinite (<a href="../bible/jdg004.htm#vrs17">Judges 4:17 sqq.</a> and <a href="../bible/jdg005.htm#vrs24">5:24 sqq.</a>). From the facts that we find the Cinites south and north, and that in Aramaic the root from which Qayin is derived implies the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a smith, Sayce (in Hastings, Dict. Bib., s.v. Kenites) draws the conclusion that the Cinites were a wandering <a href="../cathen/07066c.htm">guild</a> of smiths. This view has against it the obvious meaning of the texts (see especially <a href="../bible/gen015.htm#vrs19">Genesis 15:19</a>). Apparently the Cinites shared in the <a href="../cathen/03315a.htm">Babylonian Exile</a> and in the Restoration, but they do not appear any more as a distinct tribe and very likely were assimilated with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.
