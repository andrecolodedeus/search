<h1>Cistercian Abbey of Villers</h1>  

<p>Situated on the confines of Villers and Tilly, Duchy of Brabant, present <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Diocese of Namur</a> (Belgium), and first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the order in this territory. In April, 1146 (most probably), <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> sent twelve <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and five lay- brothers from Clairvaux, under the direction of Abbot Lawrence, to establish themselves at Boverie, from whence, after over a year of struggle against discouragement and failure, they transferred their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to a more suitable location, about three miles distant, where a modest oratory and dwelling were soon erected. The early years were replete with sufferings for the new community, but little by little, as it became known, the nobles of the vicinity came to its aid with material assistance. Abbot Charles (1197-1209) laid the foundations for the magnificent church, the ruins of which even today profoundly impress the beholder, but it was not completed until about the year 1300; he also began the construction of the new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. With the increase of temporal prosperity, and their minds free from such anxieties, the spiritual growth of the members of the community became the more remarkable; vocations were multiplied and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> attained great renown as an abode of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. In 1231 and 1238 it founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Grand Pre and Lieu St. Bernard. Towards the middle of the thirteenth century Villers was at the height of its glory; its revenues were very large, both spiritual and temporal powers regarded it with the greatest favour, and it numbered amongst its members over 100 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and 300 lay-brothers. More than 50 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and lay-brothers, who lived during this period, are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and Blessed in the Order of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>. Prominent among these were its first thirteen <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, especially G&eacute;rard I, who died <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> (1166), and Conrad de Seyne, who died <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Porto. Gradually the selection of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> became the prerogative of the sovereign, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> suffered from the intrusion of unworthy <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>; it also suffered from political disorders, so that at one time the entire community were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to quit the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> for nearly twenty years. In 1776 the community still numbered 54 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and 11 lay-brothers, but shortly afterwards (1796) the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> fell under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of suppression. Later on the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Government purchased the ruins, restored them and preserves them as a monument of the historic past.
