<h1>Cistercian Abbey of Wilhering</h1>  

<p>(HILARIA).

<p>Situated on the right bank of the Danube, in the <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Diocese of Linz</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Ulric of Willeheringen gave his castle for a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of regular canons; but as these did not fulfil the conditions required, he removed them and established the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> (1146). Under its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Geraldus, of the abbey of Runa in <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was richly endowed and placed under the protection of Eberhard, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. After Ulric's death, his brother, Colo, completed the work so well begun. Despite all this, the foundation did not flourish and Henry, the third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, having but two subjects, transferred the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to Burkhard, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ebrach (1185); hence Wilhering came to be known as its filiation. In the same year Burkhard sent Henry back to Wilhering, accompanied by twelve of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; and from this time the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> prospered. Duke Leopold VI took it under his protection; monastic buildings replaced the old castle, donations enriched them, and many exemptions and privileges were granted by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authorities</a>, especially by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>. Three foundations were made, Hohenfurth in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, Engelszell and Sausenstein in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>.

<p>This state continued until the revolt of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and the many <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of those times causes severe losses both in subjects and income. When the first imperial <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was appointed (1568) there were but three <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and two <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> In the community. In 1587, however, Alexander was nominated <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and he inaugurated reform in regular observance and temporal administration and regained possession of much of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery's</a> former <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; he also reconstructed the monastic buildings. At the end of his rule there were twenty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, four <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and one brother in the community (1641). In 1733 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was destroyed by fire, but was immediately rebuilt under Abbot Bonus Pomerl. It escaped being secularized during the period of Josephinism, though it had much to suffer during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. After these troubles and the Napoleonic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> it prospered, and the buildings, as they stand today, were completed; the church is particularly beautiful. The present and sixty-sixth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Right Rev. Theobald Grasbock, was elected in 1892; this community numbers thirty-nine <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and several <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> have care of thirty-two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> besides other positions of importance.
