<h1>Cistercian Sisters</h1>  

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was established at Tart in the <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Diocese of Langres</a> (now Dijon), in the year 1125, by sisters from the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Juilly, and with the co-operation of <a href="../cathen/14290d.htm">St. Stephen Harding</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>. At Juilly, a dependence of Molesme, Ste Humbleine, sister of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, lived and died. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Sisters of Tart founded successively Ferraque (1140) in the Diocese of Noyon, Blandecques (1153) in the Diocese of St-Omer, and Montreuil-les-Dames (1164) near Laon. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the first <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was that of Tulebras (1134) in the Kingdom of Navarre. Then came Las Huelgas de Valladolid (1140), Espirito Santo at Olmedo (1142), Villabona, or San Miguel de las Duenas (1155), Perales (1160), Gradefes (1168), etc. But the most celebrated was Santa Maria la Real, or <a href="../cathen/07512b.htm">Las Huelgas de Burgos</a>, founded in 1187 by Alfonso VIII of Castile. The observance was established there by <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who came from Tulebras, under the guidance of Misol, who became its first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>. The second <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> was Constance, daughter of the founder, who believed she had the power of preaching in her church and hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> of her religious. In the following year, 1190, the eighteen abbesses of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> held their first general chapter at Tart. The abbesses of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> themselves made the regular visits to their houses of filiation. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, by its decrees regarding the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of religious put an end to the chapter and the visits. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in 1171, were founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Santa Lucia at <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a>, San Michele at <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>, and that of <a href="../cathen/04346a.htm">Conversano</a>, the only one in the peninsula in which the abbesses carry a <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>. A century later the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Sisters were in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>.

<p>The decadence which manifested itself in the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a> towards the middle of the fourteenth century was felt also in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. But among them energetic efforts were made to restore the primitive observance or to introduce a new one. It was at this time that the order of the Conception was founded in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, at Toledo, by Beatriz de Silva. But her religious were not slow to abandon the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> rule for that of the Clares. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> Jeanne de Courcelles de Pourlan, having been elected <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Tart in 1617, restored the regular discipline in her community, which was transferred to Dijon in 1625. Owing to the hostility of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> to the reform she had her <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> withdrawn by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Order of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>. Another reform was effected at <a href="../cathen/12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a> des Champs by Ang&eacute;lique Arnauld, 1602 (see Arnauld, under Jacqueline-Marie-Angelique), who, to provide for the ever-increasing number of her religious, founded Port-Royal de Paris, in the borough of Saint-Jacques (1622). Queen Marie de Medicis declared herself protectress of this institution, and <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> exempted it from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> and placed it under that of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> of Port-Royal de Paris and of Port-Royal des Champs ended by consecrating themselves to adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. But the vicinity of the Abb&eacute; de Saint-Cyran was dangerous to them, and these religious saw the suppression and destruction of Port-Royal des Champs by order of the king (1710), while they themselves were dispersed. The <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and abbatial titles were annexed to Port-Royal de Paris, which subsisted up to the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, and was transformed first into a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and then into a maternity <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> another reform took place. Dom Augustin de Lestrange gathered the scattered <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Sisters of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, with members of other orders that had been equally dispersed, and reconstructed the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Sisterhood. In 1795 he gave them a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which he called the Holy Will of God (La Sainte-Volont&eacute; de Dieu), situated in the Bas-Valais, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The Trappistines, for so the new religious were called, were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in 1798. They <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> followed the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in their travels over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, returned to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in 1803, and remained there until 1816, when at length they were able to return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and take up their abode at Forges, near La Trappe. Two years later they occupied an old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Augustinians at Les Gardes, in the <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Diocese of Angers</a>. The Trappistines spread quickly all over <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and into other countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. They have new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in almost all parts of the world, and since the reunion of the three congregations of La Trappe, in 1892, they have been officially entitled: Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of the Strict Observance.

<p>The actual status (1908) of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Sisters, Reformed and Non-Reformed, is as follow: The Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, or Trappistines, occupy 21 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, with about 2000 religious. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are distributed as follow: nine in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, three in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, two in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. To these twenty-one houses must be added twenty others of the Non-Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, affiliated to the order of Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> so far as spiritual matters are concerned, but remaining under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The Non-Reformed, or Common Observance of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, possess: in the Congregation of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> with 124 members, in the Congregation of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> 12 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> with 574 members, and in the Observance of S&eacute;nanque two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> with thirty members. (See also <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a>.)
<h2>Cistercian nuns in America</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> who came from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> at the same time as the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, and who was joined by seventeen American <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, tried to establish a community. Circumstances prevented this. Father Vincent de Paul, at Tracadie, having asked the Congregation of Notre-Dame of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> for three sisters to help him with his mission in <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, established them there and after probation admitted them to the profession of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of La Trappe. But the community never in reality formed a part of the Order of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> and never even wore the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> habit. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Our Lady of Good Counsel, St. Romuald, near Quebec, the first genuine community of <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in America, was established in 1902 by Mother Lutgarde, <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a> of Bonneval, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. On 21 November, 1902, she brought thither a small colony of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. On 29 July of the following year Mgr. Marois, as delegate of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Quebec, blessed the new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Though this kind of life was entirely new to the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, vocations were not wanting. The means of subsistence for this house are agricultural labour and the manufacture of chocolate. The community is under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Quebec. Another at Rogersville, New Brunswick, where there were already some <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, was established by the sisters expelled by the French Government from their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Vaise, at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>.
