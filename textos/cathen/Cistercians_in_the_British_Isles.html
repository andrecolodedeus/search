<h1>Cistercians in the British Isles</h1>  

<p>St. Stephen Harding, third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> (1109-33), was an Englishman and his influence in the early organization of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a> had been very great. It was natural therefore that, when, after the coming of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> and his companions in 1113, foundations began to multiply, the project of sending a colony of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> should find favourable consideration. In Nov., 1128, with the aid of William Giffard, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, a settlement was made at Waverly near Farnham in Surrey. Five houses were founded from here before 1152 and some of them had themselves produced offshoots. But it was in the north that the order assumed its most active developments in the twelfth century. William, an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of great virtue, was sent from Clairvaux by St. Bernard in 1131, and a small <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was given to the newcomers by Walter Espec "in a place of horror and dreary solitude" at Rivaulx in Yorkshire, with the hearty support of Thurston, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>. By 1143 three hundred <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had entered there, including the famous <a href="../cathen/01172b.htm">St. &AElig;lred</a>, known for his eloquence as the St. Bernard of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Among the offshoots of Rivaulx were Melrose and Revesby. Still more famous was <a href="../cathen/06161a.htm">Fountains</a> near Ripon. The foundation was made in 1132 by a section of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from the great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> house of St. Mary's, <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, who desired to lead a more austere life. After many struggles and great hardships, St. Bernard agreed to send them a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from Clairvaux to instruct them, and in the end they prospered exceedingly. The great beauty of the ruins excites wonder even today, and before 1152 <a href="../cathen/06161a.htm">Fountains</a> had many offshoots, of which Newminster and Meaux are the most famous. Another great reinforcement to the order was the accession of the houses of the Savigny foundation, which were incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, at the instance of Eugenius III, in 1138. Thirteen <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, of which the most famous were <a href="../cathen/06324a.htm">Furness</a> and Jervaulx, thus adopted the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> rule. By the year 1152 there were fifty-four <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, some few of which, like the beautiful Abbey of <a href="../cathen/14736d.htm">Tintern</a> on the Wye, had been founded directly from the Continent. Architecturally speaking the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and churches, owing to their pure style, may be counted among the most beautiful <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. To the wool and cloth trade, which was especially fostered by the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was largely indebted for the beginnings of her commercial prosperity.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">overthrow of monastic foundations</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> habit was not seen in the British Isles until some <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the austere reform of La Trappe (hence often called <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>), driven out by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> intending to proceed to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. This intention was accidentally frustrated and in 1794 they were received at Lulworth in Dorsetshire by Thomas Weld. Most of them afterwards aided in restoring the great Abbey of Mount Melleray in Brittany and still later in establishing a new Mount Melleray in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. This flourishing house at Cappoquin, Co. Waterford, now has a community of nearly 70, of them 29 are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Another and more recent foundation at Roscrea, Co. Tipperary, in the <a href="../cathen/08641a.htm">Diocese of Killaloe</a>, numbers 66 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> with 28 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, St. Bernard's Abbey, Coalville, Leicestershire, founded in 1835, is on a smaller scale and numbers only 7 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The only <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in the British Isles is at Stapehill near <a href="../cathen/15648a.htm">Wimborne</a>, Dorsetshire. It has a community of 42 members.
