<h1>Civil Incorporation of Church Property</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at its very beginning, found the concept of the corporation well developed under <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> and widely and variously organized in Roman <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. It was a concept that the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> soon adapted to their organization and, as a means of protection in the periods of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Whether we attach to the burial corporations (<em>collegia tenuiorum</em> or <em>funeraticia</em>) of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the importance that <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> and other arch&aelig;ologists do, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that in the second and third centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era the corporation was generally resorted to as a means of holding, and transmitting <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. In later times this concept fitted in naturally with the genius of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and the great monastic establishments of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> were organized on that plan. "In the Middle Ages, all life", says Dr. Shahan (Middle Ages, p. 346), "was corporate. As religion was largely carried on by the corporations of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, so the civic life and its <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were everywhere in the hands of corporations." The <a href="../cathen/10579a.htm">mortmain</a> legislation of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> indicates that the corporation, as adapted for the holding of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, was not only a secure, but a prosperous method of tenure in times of <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a>. In one instance, the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> improved upon the Roman concept of the corporation. The corporation sole was a refinement of the canon lawyers. Its most familiar instance in English law is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the vicar, or the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, who succeeds to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of an office and by consequence to the sole custody of its temporalities. Blackstone's division of corporation into lay and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> (Commentaries, Book II, ch. 18) has no application in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> where all incorporated religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are treated as private civic corporations.
<h2>In the United States</h2>

<p>While in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> corporations exist or are created by prescription, royal charter, or Act of Parliament, in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> they are created by the state legislature, either by special Act or under the provisions of general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. Congress may create corporations only as incident to its powers of government, as set forth in the federal constitution, and not in any case, religious corporations. General provisions for the incorporation of religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are found, at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of most of the states (as New York, in 1784). And provisions for the incorporation of the churches of special <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> soon followed (in New York, for the <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Protestant Episcopal Church</a> in 1813; for the Society of Friends in 1839; for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in 1863). Prior to the Revolution, when the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was without civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the colonies, title to its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was held in the name of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> estates in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> were so held for one hundred and fifty years. With the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> bodies proceeded after the fashion of their fellow citizens of other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, to incorporate. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were among the first: the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian Fathers</a> at Philadelphia, in 1796; the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, in 1805; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, in 1815; some years later the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, by Act of legislature in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, etc. With the acquiescence of Archbishop Carroll many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> also incorporated; St. Mary's and <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, two Philadelphia congregations, as early as 1788. There was no uniform plan followed in these articles of incorporation, and no sufficient safeguarding of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. In the ensuing years a number of disedifying controversies arose between lay trustees on the one hand and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his representative, the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, on the other, chiefly relating to the right of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to designate for the congregation a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> not of their preference, or (as in the case of the famous Hogan <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in Philadelphia, 1821-2) to exclude a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> deemed unfit or disqualified. Troubles of this kind led to a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> dated August 22, 1822, from <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> to Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal, in which "the immoderate and unlimited <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> which trustees or the administrators of the temporal properties of the Church assume independently of the diocesan bishops", is condemned. As a further consequence, the fifth <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (1829), orders: "Since lay trustees have too often abused the power given them by the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, to the great detriment of religion, we greatly desire that in the future no church shall be built or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> unless it shall have been assigned, by written instrument to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in whose diocese it is to be built, wherever this can be done." This policy, in a general way, governed the tenure of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> for the ensuing generation, and by 1855 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (except those held by <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders) were almost wholly in the name of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.



<p>But in the meanwhile, it appears to have been recognized that the holding of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, under the rules of canon law, was fraught with some dangers and inconveniences. In 1855 the New York legislature had passed a law providing that "no interest in <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, real or personal, should be conveyable or descendible to any ecclesiastic or his successor in any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office". There was similar legislation in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. Such legislation, with the waning of the anti-Catholic spirit which had fostered it, was soon repealed; but in 1863, a measure for the incorporation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, drawn by the eminent lawyer, Charles O'Conor, at the request of Archbishop Hughes, was enacted by the New York legislature. This measure may be regarded as another deviation in the policy of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, away from the plan of vesting in fee simple the large temporalities of great <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in one man, even though subject to the trusteeship prescribed in the canon law, and a return to some of the features of lay trusteeship, limited and safeguarded however by the rules of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>.

<p>Meanwhile such instances as the attempt of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> relatives in 1868 to contest the will of <a href="../cathen/02282b.htm">Bishop Baraga</a>, devising the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> of the Marquette Diocese to his successor, and the Purcell failure in 1879 (involving two hundred pieces of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> and a long period of litigation), were so persuasive that "the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1884), in its decrees on the subject of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, urges the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to place all <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> under the protection of legal incorporation, where it can be done safely, as in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>; where such incorporation cannot be made it requests the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to have himself made a corporation sole and thus hold the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> as any other corporation would; and where this cannot be done it permits him to hold the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in fee simple" (Rev. J. M. Farley, now Archbishop Farley, in "The Forum", June, 1894). Justice Strong, formerly of the United States Supreme Court, says: "Almost all, if not all, the questions mooted in the civil courts of this country, relating to church polity, discipline, officers or members, have arisen incidentally in controversies respecting <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>" (Relation of Civil Law to Church Polity, p. 40). It is recognized in numerous decisions of American courts (Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law, XXIV, 330), that the terms "church" and "incorporated religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>" are not identical. The former is the larger term &mdash; its objects and purposes are moral and religious, the church corporation is subsidiary, having to do chiefly with the care and control of the temporalities. While for various, and no doubt sufficient reasons, the title to <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> continues in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in fee simple as heretofore, in a number of states, e.g. <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, the tendency is towards incorporation, either by special acts making the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> a "corporation sole" or under the terms of general provisions drawn especially to suit the needs and circumstances of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, e.g. the New York law of 1863, or agreeable thereto, as the Michigan law of 1897. In <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> holds all <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> as a corporation sole. This title was obtained from the legislature of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> by Archbishop Whitfield; its powers and scope were enlarged in the time of Archbishop Spalding, and again in the time of Archbishop Bayley and also under Cardinal Gibbons. By an act of the <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> legislature (ch. 506; 1897) "the present <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Archdiocese of Boston</a>, and his successors in office, shall be and are made a body politic and corporation sole" to receive, take and hold, by sale, gift, lease, devise or otherwise real and personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of every description for religious, charitable and burial purposes. There are similar Acts for the other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> Archdiocese all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is held by "the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>" as a corporation sole; he is responsible for all matters pertaining to its administration. This is in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">State of Illinois</a>. Under the provisions of the <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> code, the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> in the several <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> within the state is held by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> as a corporation sole. Section 602 of the <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> code provides: "Whenever the rules, regulations or discipline of any <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denomination</a>, <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> or church so require, for the temporalities thereof, and the management of the estate and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> thereof, it shall be lawful for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or presiding elder of such <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denomination</a>, <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> or church to become a sole corporation, in the manner prescribed in this title, as nearly as may be, and with all the powers and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and for the uses and purposes in this title provided for religious incorporation and subject to all the provisions, conditions and limitations in said title prescribed." By the terms of the New York Act of 1863 (ch. 45), the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the congregation and two <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, the two last being selected by the three first mentioned or by a majority of them, form the board of trustees. The two <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> hold office for one year and their successors are appointed in the same manner as provided for the original selection. The New York law has furnished the model for like <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> in <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, <a href="../cathen/11111b.htm">North</a> and <a href="../cathen/14160a.htm">South Dakota</a>, and other states. In <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a> (Sec. 2001-10, m. S., ch. 37; Laws of 1883) "the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> being the only trustee of each <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> church in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, may cause any or all congregations therein to be incorporated by adding four more members as trustees as hereinafter provided. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the congregation to be incorporated together with two <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, practical communicants of such congregation (the latter to be chosen from and by the congregation) shall be trustees." It is provided that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> may be represented by proxy at any meeting of the board of trustees. The trustees or directors, may, by unanimous vote, adopt by-laws not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a>.

<p>In Michigan an Act to revise, amend, and consolidate the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the incorporation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> bodies, passed in 1897, was regarded by the late Rev. P. A.  Baart, an eminent canonist, as "the most liberal of any law in the country" on the subject. He says that "being a general law which fits all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, it will not be easily changed in the future." Some of the provisions of this enactment are as follows: "Section 1. The people of the state of <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a> enact, That it shall be lawful for any five or more <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of full age to become incorporated as a church, religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> or other <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the purpose of diffusing moral or religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by complying with the following conditions. . . ." (These relate to the statements to be contained in the articles of association and the filing of such articles with the registrar of deeds and the secretary of State.) "Section 4. The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> forming such corporations shall adopt by-laws, and execute and acknowledge them in the same manner as the articles of association above provided for, and such by-laws shall be recorded in the office of the registrar of deeds of the county where such corporation is to hold its regular meetings. Such by-laws shall prescribe the qualifications of members; the manner in which they shall be admitted, suspended or expelled; the officers of such corporations, their official title, their term of office; the manner of their election and removal from office; their official <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>; the time and manner of calling and holding meetings, etc." The constitution of one state, <a href="../cathen/15605a.htm">West Virginia</a>, prohibits the granting of charters of incorporation to religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. It may be said that as a rule, all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> throughout the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> which have attained any importance or permanence are incorporated, usually under the provisions of general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> for the incorporation of civil corporations. In states, such as <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a> and New York (especially prior to 1893), where the principle of the statute of charitable uses is not recognized, bequests to unincorporated institutions have frequently been declared invalid because of the uncertainty of the beneficiary (Ruth and others <em>vs</em>. Oberbrunner and another: 40 Wis. 238). In many states, such as New York and <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, legacies to religious corporations are exempt from the inheritance tax; whereas a bequest to an unincorporated body, even though religious in its purposes, would be charged with the inheritance tax. Thus, in New York, a bequest to a missionary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, known as "The <a href="../cathen/10368c.htm">Paulist Fathers</a>" was held liable to the tax [In <em>r&eacute;</em> Kavanaugh estate (Surr.), 6 N. Y., Supp. 619]. The inheritance tax legislation which is now coming to be practically general, may, in states where the title to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> is still held by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in fee simple, raise issues of some financial importance when it comes to transferring the estate of a deceased <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to his successor. The policy of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> evidently favours the incorporation of religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. This is also shown in the extra safeguards which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of many states throw about the incorporated cemetery.
<h2>In Great Britain</h2>

<p>The state does not consider the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a corporation. Neither is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> made a corporation sole. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is usually held by trustees under a trust deed, or by joint ownership, where no trust has been declared. The mere purpose of holding or administering <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> would not be admitted by the Registrar-General as a purpose which would warrant the registering of a corporation under the Companies Act. Up to 1832, when the Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Charity Act was enacted, the only way the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had of securing bequests and foundations was to place the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> or money in the names of private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who could be depended upon to apply it as desired by the donor. If these private parties appropriated the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> or money or in any manner disregarded the trust, there was no remedy, as in the eyes of English law it was held to be their private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. A great deal of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> at the present day is simply invested in names, generally three, without mentioning any trust. When the Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Charities Act of 1860 was before Parliament the question of declaring trusts was referred by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> was of opinion that owing to bequests for Masses, etc., and conditions which the courts would hold as <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> there was great danger of losing the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> altogether. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> took the opinion of the majority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and in 1862 decided that trusts might be declared in accordance with the Act except in cases where there would be danger to the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. As a rule, however, the implied trust is generally recognized even to the extent of excusing such <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> from inheritance or succession <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. There is a charity Trust Act (1853, with later amendments) authorizing the registration of mission, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and conventual <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> as a means of securing it for the purpose intended; but owing to the powers of the government department over such registered <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and the publicity involved, many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and superiors have not availed themselves of the advantages of the Act.

<h2>In Canada</h2>

<p>Corporate bodies may be created in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> either by authority of the Dominion Parliament or of the Legislature of any of the provinces. The respective powers as to incorporation are derived from the "British North America Act," 1867, under which the Dominion was constituted. Section 91 of that Act sets out the powers of the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and Section 92 the exclusive powers of the provincial Legislatures. To the latter was given the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in relation to "municipal institutions in the province", "local works and undertakings" (with certain specified exceptions), "the incorporation of companies with provincial objects", "property and civil rights in the province", and "generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province". Bodies corporate falling within any of the above classes can be created by provincial charter. In all other cases the charter must be procured from the federal authorities. The sections of the "British North America Act" dealing with the distribution of the legislative powers, and very particularly in their application to commercial corporations, have been subjected to judicial interpretation in many cases decided in the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Courts and in the judicial committee of the Privy Council. A provincial legislature may pass Acts enabling corporations to carry on certain operations within that particular province, and the Dominion Parliament may pass Acts empowering corporations to carry on the same operations throughout the whole Dominion. If a Dominion corporation should decide to confine its operations to one province only, its status as a corporation is not thereby affected. On the other hand, it has been decided that a fire insurance company created under authority of a provincial Act is not inherently incapable of entering, outside its province of origin, into a valid contract of insurance relating to <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> also outside of those limits (Can. Pac. Ry. Co. <em>vs</em>. Ottawa Fire Ins. Co., 39 Sup. Ct. Rep. 405). Corporations, whether federal or provincial, may be created in two ways, &mdash; by special Act or by letters patent. When the former mode is adopted, the Bill to create the corporation is introduced and passed through Parliament or the Legislature, as the case may be, in the same manner as other Bills, and subject to the rules of procedure of the legislative body. Religious corporations are created by special Act. Commercial companies are generally created by letters patent; and application therefor is made by petition, setting forth the proposed name of the company, the objects for which it is sought to be incorporated, the amount of the capital, number of shares, and information of a like nature. After examination of the petition and payment of a prescribed fee, the Governor-General of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> or the Governor of the province, as the case may be, issues letters patent to the applicant. All corporations must comply with the provincial regulations, as to payment of license to do business within any particular province, and with municipal regulations as to payment of taxes, etc. Foreign corporations are permitted to exercise their functions within any of the provinces of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> under the comity of nations, but they must also comply with all local regulations.
