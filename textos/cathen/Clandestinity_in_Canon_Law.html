<h1>Clandestinity (in Canon Law)</h1>  

<p>Strictly speaking, clandestinity signifies a matrimonial <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediment</a> introduced by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, c. i) to invalidate marriages contracted at variance with the exigencies of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a>, commonly so called because the first word of the Latin text is <em>tametsi</em>. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> reads:

<blockquote><p>Those who attempt to contract matrimony otherwise than in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or of another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> with leave of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or of the ordinary, and before two or three witnesses, the Holy Synod renders altogether incapable of such a contract, and declares such contracts null and void.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> did not transmit any historical record of this question. While upholding the validity of clandestine marriages "as long as the Church does not annul them", the council asserts that "for weighty reasons the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">holy Church of God</a> always abhorred and prohibited them" (Sess. XXIV, De reformatione matrimonii). That this sentence strikes the keynote of unending antipathy on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> towards clandestine marriages can be gathered by a brief review of the historical attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the fifth chapter of his Epistle to Polycarp, St. Ignatius intimates how men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> about to marry should enter wedlock with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> consent, so that their marriage may be in the Lord (Ante-Nicene Fathers, I, 100). <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> writes that matrimonial unions contracted without the intervention of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority are liable to be judged tantamount to fornication and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> (<a href="../fathers/0407.htm"><em>On Pudicity</em> 4</a>). In another passage he extols the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of that union which is cemented by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, confirmed by oblation, sealed with blessing, which <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> proclaim, and which the Father in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> ratifies (Ad uxorem, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., II, 9). The thirteenth canon of the so-called Fourth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> requires parties contracting marriage to be presented to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> or bridal attendants in order to receive the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, History of the Councils, II, 412). Whatever may be the age of this canon, the custom therein enjoined had previously won the approval of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, who earnestly sought to have all marriages sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> pall and benediction (Epistle xix to Vigilius, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XVI, 984). The Code of Justinian bears evidence to the influence which this imperial legislator wielded to secure the public celebration of marriage according to some legitimate form ("Novell&aelig;", or New Constitutions, xxii, lxiv, cxvii).

<p>In the ninth century the Emperor Basil gave the force of written law to a widely observed custom of having a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> assist at marriages to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> and crown the married parties. Not long after, Leo the Philosopher declared that marriages celebrated without a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> blessing were worthless. The replies of <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> (863) to the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals</a>, as well as the "Decretum" of Burchard and that of Gratian embody ample evidence to prove that, during the ninth century and thereafter, the public celebration of nuptials was prescribed and clandestine marriage condemned. Though Gratian alleges forged <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> to show the prohibition of clandestine marriages, it must be granted that he faithfully records the usage of his age concerning the validity of such marriages. Though <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1159-1181) maintained the validity of clandestine marriage when no other <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediment</a> intervened, he <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> parties contracting such marriages to undergo penance, and suspended for three years any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> assisting thereat. (Wernz, Jus Decretalium, IV, title III, no. 516.) Another step in advance was made when <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215), inaugurated the proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/02255a.htm">banns</a>.

<p>Finally, a turning-point in the history of this question was reached when the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> enacted the <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a> as a measure destined to check abuses and to safeguard the sacredness of the marriage contract. The principal elements of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> pertained to the sentence of nullification affecting marriages of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> failing to enter wedlock in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or his legitimate representative and in that of two or more witnesses; to the ways and means of publishing the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>; and to the penalty awaiting transgressors thereof. A succinct comment concerning these points will elucidate the purport of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. In the first place, to attain the desired end more effectually, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> decreed a singular method of <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>. It ordered that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> should be published in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and that it should take effect only after thirty days from its publication. When a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> comprised many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, publication in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> church was sufficient. The term "parochial church" comprehends missions attended by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on whom the faithful depend for the ministrations of religion (Cong. of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, 14 November, 1883). Publication of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> in churches situated in such missions had the force of law. A new publication was not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> when a newly-organized <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> results from the dismemberment of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> wherein the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> already obtained. On the contrary, if a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> should be united to one hitherto exempt, the former would remain bound by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and the latter retain its immunity (Cong. of Inquis., 14 Dec., 1859).



<p>For obvious reasons, the vernacular should be used in publishing the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. The use of Latin would, according to the principles of canon law, render the act illicit but not invalid (Gasparri, Tractatus Canonicus de Matrimonio, II, v, 119). The publication would be worthless unless the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> were made known to the faithful as a <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> law or as an ordinance emanating from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. While one publication sufficed to induce <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, the council suggested repeated publication during the first year of tenure. This publication might be made whenever a congregation assembled in church. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was sometimes published in a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> to bind parishioners speaking one language to the exclusion of those using a different tongue. Sometimes the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was intended to <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> none but <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> residing within the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> lines. In a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, wherein <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> settled after the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was duly <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> applied to all, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. In such cases the <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a> declared null <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> marriages or clandestine <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> (<a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a>, 26 March, 1830). In a non-Catholic district containing only a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, the marriage of a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> with another <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, or the clandestine marriage of a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, would be valid although the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the neighbourhood should so increase as to warrant the actual publication of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (<a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, 27 June, 1805; Cong. of <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, 24 November and 29 November, 1852). Finally, populations once largely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in whose <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was published might be supplanted by non-Catholics. Though canonists are not unanimous in their verdict regarding the application of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in such conditions, Gasparri, among others, holds that in such cases the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> would not bind non-Catholics. For this was, says he, the case when <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> issued his Declaration for <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> (Gasparri, op. cit., II, v, 202).

<p>After these general considerations concerning the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, it may not be amiss to note where the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was actually published. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was published in the province of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>; in the province of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, together with <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>, except that part bordering the Colorado River; in the province of Santa F&eacute;, except the northern part of <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/07744a.htm">Diocese of Indianapolis</a>; in St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a>, St. Charles (Missouri), St. Ferdinand, Kaskaskia, French Village, and Prairie du Rocher. In <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was published in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and adjacent islands; in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine; in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> (<a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 18 January, 1906), <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, Rotterdam, Geneva (Zitelli, Apparatus Juris Eccles., I, 428), and Malta (Cong. Inquis., 18 March, 1884). It is no easy matter to give accurate specifications for regions outside <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (Lehmkuhl, Theologia Moralis, II, 563). The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was not published in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> (Zitelli, op. cit., I, 430). In some localities circumstances paved the way towards a partial <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (Zitelli, op. cit., I, 437). Furthermore, although the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> might have been <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, the action of legitimate authority could limit its binding force. Thus <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> terminated the controversy concerning the marriages of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. The fact that many <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> paved the way for questioning the application of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> already <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in that country. To solve this difficulty <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> ruled that henceforth <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> or <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, clandestinely contracted, would be valid, provided no other <a href="../cathen/07695a.htm">impediment</a> intervened. This declaration was subsequently extended to other localities in which the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was not <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> until <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> had organized their own congregations in such places. In this way the declaration of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> found application in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, Trinidad, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> with the exception of the San Francisco province, the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, the Malabar Coast, the Coromandel Coast, Constantinople and suburbs, <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Diocese of Warsaw</a>, <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Archdiocese of Bombay</a>, <a href="../cathen/04566a.htm">Diocese of Culm</a>, Duchy of Cleves, <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>, Maastricht, and the suburb of St. Peter near Maastricht.

<p>It may be well to note here the way in which the term <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is to be understood in this declaration. It comprehended <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but who subsequently adopted the tenets of some <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had reached the years of discretion and had been alienated from their Faith by the influence of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> whose religion they thereafter professed; <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> who allied themselves with some <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> professing no religion whatever (Gasparri, op. cit., II, v, 208). Whenever the requirements of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> were reduced to practice owing to legitimate usage, no further <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to render the measure effective (Cong. of Holy Office, 1 May, 1887). The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> once published in any <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, could be set aside by revocation on the part of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It could also be abrogated by contrary usage or desuetude. Thus, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 8 October, 1803, decided that marriages contracted before a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister are valid where the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> has lapsed into desuetude. In like manner, the Congregation of the Holy Office decided that the <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a> had passed into desuetude in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> (11 March, 1806). At the same time the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> repeatedly declared that the <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a> did not lose its binding force in a given place because <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> residing there declined to observe it, no matter how long they refused to abide by its requirements (Cong. of Holy Office, 6 July, 1892).

<p>Regarding the subjects of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to note that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> invalidating clandestine marriages was both local and personal (Cong. of Holy. Office, 14 December, 1859). In its local application the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> comprehended all who contracted marriage in any place where the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> had been duly <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, whether they were residents, aliens, travellers, transients, or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> having no fixed abode, because those who come from an exempt territory are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recognize and observe universal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Moreover, since jurists claim that territory governs contracts, it follows that residents, aliens, travellers, transients, and those without fixed abode, must observe <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> circumscribing contracts in the place where such contracts are made. A decision of the Holy Office, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 25 January, 1900, gave new weight to this accepted axiom of canonists. On account of the personal element embodied in this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of observing it applied to those thereunto subjected where-ever they might chance to be. For this reason parties having a domicile or quasi-domicile in a district where the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> held remained liable to its <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> as often as they betook themselves to an exempt territory to evade the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Those whose sole or whose chief object in such case was to enter wedlock, were considered guilty of evading the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. However, where one of the contracting parties had acquired a domicile or quasi-domicile in an exempt territory, their marriage, if contracted there, would be valid because the privilege enjoyed by one was here communicable to the other (Benedict XIV, De Synodo, VI, vi).

<p>The better to complete this explanation, a word concerning the terms <em>domicile</em> and <em>quasi-domicile</em> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. An <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> domicile involves two elements, namely, residence in a particular <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and an intention of abiding there for the greater part of a year. This intention is gauged by external acts whose manifestation marks the actual acquisition of a domicile which is retained thereafter notwithstanding protracted absence, provided the intention of returning perseveres. In like manner residence in a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and an intention of dwelling there during a considerable portion of the year denote the elements giving consistency to a quasi-domicile. Hence, an individual may be domiciled in one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and acquire a quasi-domicile in another. Six months' sojourn in the same <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> entitled parties to invite the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> to assist at their nuptials. Nevertheless, in answer to a petition made by the Fathers of the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (22 May, 1886) granted for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to parties moving from a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> where the <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a> obtained to another <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and residing there for a full month, the privilege of a quasi-domicile so far as the matrimonial contract was concerned. Nor would the privilege be forfeited in case the contracting parties should pass thirty days in such a place in order to enter wedlock there (<a href="../cathen/12584c.htm">Putzer</a>, Commentarium in Facultates Apostolicas, no. 49). Although the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> involved a personal element, clandestine marriages were valid as often as the observance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was physically or morally impossible, provided such impossibility was general and continued for a month (Cong. of Inquis., 1 July, 1863; 14 November, 1883). Parties whose circumstances led them to profit by this interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to seek the nuptial blessing at their earliest convenience, and to see that their marriage was entered in the proper register (Cong. of Inquis., 14 November, 1883).

<p>To the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of either contracting party belonged the right of officiating at their nuptials. Vicars appointed to exercise the functions of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> with the fullness of the pastoral ministry enjoyed the same right so long as they held office (Cong. of Inquis., 7 Sept., 1898). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> alone could counteract the exercise of this pastoral prerogative. The presence of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in the capacity of witness satisfied the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> even though he was not formally invited for that purpose (Cong. of Inquis., 17 Nov., 1835). The consent of those about to marry had to be signified in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and other witnesses required by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. Since the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> enjoys universal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he could validly assist at any marriage whatever. <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> had no longer the right of assisting at marriages in their titular churches. Legates of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were qualified to assist at marriages contracted within the confines of their legation. Bishops might minister at marriages in any portion of their respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. According to Gasparri (op. cit., II, v, 154), an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> might exercise this right for the subjects of his suffragans provided he visited their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> according to the requirements of canon law. To a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> was accorded the right of officiating at any marriage in the diocese. Those in whom this right was vested were at liberty to delegate another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to act in their stead. Such delegation might be special or general. As often as the delegation was special, little danger of invalidity was feared. On the contrary, when general <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is transmitted to delegates, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> questions, not so much validity, as legitimacy of action. Hence, the Congregation of the Council (20 July, 1889) reproved the conduct of those <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who habitually interchanged the faculty of assisting at the marriages of their respective subjects, because such methods tended to render the <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a> ineffectual so far as the presence of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is concerned. At the same time this Congregation (18 March, 1893) and the Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> (9 November, 1898) approved general delegation within judicious limits. Notification of his commission to assist at nuptials had to be given directly to the delegate, either by the individual authorizing him to act or by a messenger specially chosen for this purpose (Sanchez, De Matrimonio, disp. xxvi, no. 8). The commission might be granted orally or in writing. No <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> would be justified in presuming permission to assist at marriages. So strict was this rule that a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> had no power to ratify marriages whose invalidity was superinduced in this way. In like manner, the Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> (7 September, 1898) decided that the ordinary faculties granted by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, empowering them to administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, did not qualify them to assist at marriages. Sanchez (op. cit., disp. xxxv, no. 20) claims that tacit notification would be sufficient to justify a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to assist at nuptials.

<p>Besides the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, at least two witnesses were required for the validity of a marriage contract. The use of reason and the possibility of actually testifying render any individual capable of exercising this particular function (Benedict XIV, De Synodo, xxiii, no. 6). The simultaneous presence of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and witnesses was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to comply with the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a> (Sanchez, op. cit., disp. xli, no. 3). Parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or others officiating at marriages without the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> number of witnesses, or witnesses assisting without the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, rendered themselves, together with the contracting parties, liable to severe punishment at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Moreover, a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or any other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, whether regular or secular, assisting without the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor's</a> consent at nuptials of parties belonging to his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was suspended from <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions until absolved by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> whose <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> had been disregarded.
<h2>New legislation on clandestine marriage</h2>

<p>Through the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Ne Temere," issued 2 August, 1907, by the Congregation of the Council, in conjunction with the pontifical commission for the new canonical code, important modifications have been made regarding the form of <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> and of marriage. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was issued to render easier for the universal Church the substantial form of matrimony, to prevent more efficiently the too numerous, hasty, and clandestine marriages, and to make it easier for <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a> to decide as to the existence or non-existence of a previous engagement to marry (see <a href="../cathen/05542d.htm">ESPOUSALS</a>). With the exception in regard to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> noted below, this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> went into effect at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (19 April), 1908, and is thenceforth binding on all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> throughout the world, any contrary law or custom being totally abolished. According to this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, marriages of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are henceforth null unless celebrated before a duly qualified <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>) and at least two witnesses. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of marriages in which either of the parties is or has been a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The law, however, does not bind those who are not and never have been <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Priests charged with the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the territory where a marriage is contracted, or any approved <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whom one charged with the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> or whom the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> delegates, are qualified to assist at nuptials. Marriages contracted in a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, district, or diocese, other than the one to which the contracting parties belong, are valid so long as the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the place or his delegate assists at such marriages. However, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are forbidden to assist at such marriages unless one of two conditions is verified. Either, one of the parties must have resided a month in the territory where the marriage occurs, or else, one of the parties must have obtained the permission of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> under whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> such a party resides. In cases of serious necessity such permission is not required.

<p>The following conditions are enjoined by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Ne Temere", not for the validity of the marriages of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but to bring them into complete conformity with the demands of right order. Marriages ought to be celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of the bride. If the contracting parties wish to marry elsewhere, they must ask the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the place, or some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> authorized by him or by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to assist at the marriage, and one of the parties must have resided there for a month. When parties find this procedure inconvenient, one of them must obtain permission from his or her <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to contract marriage elsewhere. In such cases the parties will be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> assurance regarding their freedom to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, and to comply with the usual conditions for receiving the Sacrament of Matrimony. When parties have no fixed abode and are travelling throughout the country, they can enter wedlock only before a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> authorized by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to assist at their marriage.

<p>The Sacred Congregation of the Council declared (11 February, 1908) that the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> granted in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Provida" of 18 January, 1906, for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> will still remain in force. According to this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, while <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> marriages in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> were made subject to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a>, <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> and those of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> among themselves were exempted. (See <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">MARRIAGE</a>; PARISH PRIEST; <a href="../cathen/05103b.htm">DOMICILE</a>.)
