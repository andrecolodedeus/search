<h1>Claude Bernard</h1>  

<p>A French ecclesiastic known as "the poor <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>" (<em>le pauvre pr&ecirc;tre</em>), b. at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> 23 December, 1588; d. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 23 March, 1641. His father was a distinguished lawyer, and filled successively offices of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and responsibility. Young Bernard was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of Dole and was remarked for his brilliant <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and wit. Pierre Le Camus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Belley</a>, urged him to enter the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but he declined, saying that he preferred the life of a poor gentleman to that of a poor <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Shortly afterwards he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of M. de Bellegarde, Governor of Bourgogne. For a while the social life of the capital attracted him; gradually, however, some disappointments together with the death of an intimate friend who was killed in a <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a>, brought about a decided change in his mode of life and led up to his entrance into the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the above mentioned Bishop Le Camus and invited to his first Mass the poor of the city, distributing to them all his possessions, and, later on, an inheritance of 400,000 livres, or about eighty thousand dollars.

<p>Henceforth Bernard devoted himself to the service of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and delighted in the name of "the poor <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>". The poor, the sick and the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> were his special care; He fed, nursed, consoled, and instructed them with more than motherly tenderness. This life of self-sacrifice seemed rather to increase his personal charms. Wealthy and distinguished <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> sought his company, and for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of entertainment at his modest table contributed abundantly to his charities. His kindly wit never deserted him. When <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a> once pressed upon him the acceptance of some favours he replied that he would be pleased if stronger boards were placed in the tumbril, or cart, on which the condemned were taken to execution. "It is a pity", said he, "that the constant dread of falling through the vehicle should distract out attention from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>".

<p>Bernard's methods were characterized by some as odd and reprehensible. He continued, however to enjoy the friendship and admiration of saintly <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> like Bourdoise, <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">Olier</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> &mdash; an ample justification of his character and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> ministry. In the history of charity, he bears a striking resemblance to <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> and <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> has often been urged by the royal court and by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He founded at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the poor candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Trent-Trois which still exists. He contributed much to popularize the beautiful <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> known as the <em>Memorare</em>, sometimes attributed to him but certainly of an earlier date.
