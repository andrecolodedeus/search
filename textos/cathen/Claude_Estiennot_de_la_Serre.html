<h1>Claude Estiennot de la Serre</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Congregation of Saint-Maur</a>, b. at Varennes, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1639; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1699. He joined the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at Vendome and was professed there in 1658. After teaching humanities for a short time to the junior <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at Pontlevoy, he was, at the instance of Dom Lue d'Achery, sent to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">Abbey</a> of St-Germain-des-Pres, Paris, where his aptitude for study and research was quickly discovered by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Dom Mabillon</a>, whose intimate friend and fellow-worker he became. Together they journeyed on foot through <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, visiting all its chief <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>. In 1670 he was made sub-prior of St-Martin's, Pontoise, a history of which <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, in three volumes, was his first published work. Between 1673 and 1682 he compiled his chief work, entitled "Antiquit&eacute;s B&eacute;n&eacute;dictines", in which the monastic traditions of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> are treated under the headings of the different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In 1684 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> for his congregation in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia Romana</a>, which post required his residence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the remainder of his life. On his way thither from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> hs visited numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and collected a great quantity of literary material, which he sent back to <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Dom Mabillon</a> and most of which found its way into the "Annales O.S.B." or the <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana"</a>. During the fifteen years he lived in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he laboured fruitfully on behalf of his congregation, and he was also greatly trusted by the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, for whom he acted in many matters of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> business. He enjoyed the entire confidence of several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and other high officials of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and he is described as combining all the qualities of a man of letters with great business ability. Besides the history of Pontoise and the "Antiquit&eacute;s", already mentioned, he collected sixteen volumes of "Fragments historiques", but though he did not publish much under his own name, he worked incessantly in the chief <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, all of which were open to him, and the results of his researches he forwarded to <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Dom Mabillon</a> and others at St-Germain-des-Pres, to whom they were of great service. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the church of the Minims of SS. Trinit&agrave; de' Monti.
