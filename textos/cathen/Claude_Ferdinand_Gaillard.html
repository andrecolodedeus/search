<h1>Claude Ferdinand Gaillard</h1>  

<p>A French engraver and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 7 Jan., 1834; d. there, 27 Jan., 1887. His early studies were probably with Hopwood and Lecouturier; but his chief master was Cogniet, with whom he began engraving in 1850. In this year, he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. At first he had to engrave fashion-plates to make money enough to live, but his determined application to his art brought him the Prix de <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for engraving, in 1856. At his first public showing in 1860, his prints were called laboured, soft, and flaccid, more like dry-point etchings than burin work, and he was advised to adhere to the established rules of his art. Gaillard had already chosen a new method, and his work was a shock, because not done according to the formulae that trammelled engravers of that day. He was such an innovator that in 1863 he was among the "refus&eacute;s", but in their exhibition his portrait of <a href="../cathen/02416b.htm">Bellini</a> was hailed by Burty as the work of a master, "who engraved with religious care and showed a high classical talent". Gaillard's manner &mdash; the new manner &mdash; was to engrave with soft, delicate lines, drawn closely together but not crossing, and to render with vaporous delicacy every fold, wrinkle, or mark on the skin with Van Eyck-like care. Henceforth Gaillard was represented by engravings and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> at every Salon. He is best known by his "L'Homme &agrave; l'Oeillet", which brought him only $100. This masterpiece was completed in eight days &mdash; the face in one.

<p>His admirable portraits of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, broad in general effect although worked with microscopic <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and realism, raised "the insubordinate scholar" to the rank of the most celebrated engraver of his day. Another great plate is the <a href="../cathen/13668a.htm">St. Sebastian</a> modelled with delicate touches, and showing studied outline, delicate chiaroscuro, and a marvellous relief. "My aim" he said "is not to charm, but to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; my art is to say all." His marvellous work led many to suspect he had some secret process or mysterious "tour de main", but it was his penetrating <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and observant eye that seized the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> beneath the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> face. Gaillard was decorated in 1876, became officer of the "L&eacute;gion d'Honneur" in 1886, and President of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Graveurs au Burin in 1886. Just before his death the Government ordered him to engrave <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci's</a> "Last Supper" and "Mona Lisa". As a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Gaillard was accurate, minute and conscientious; yet his small canvases are effective, exhibit great power of characterization, and are large in their "ensemble". He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the human face as he engraved it &mdash; with the precision and exactitude of the early Flemings. His catalogued engravings number 80; his "Virgin" after Bellini deserves special mention.
