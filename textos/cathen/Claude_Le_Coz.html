<h1>Claude Le Coz</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, b. at Plou&eacute;vez-Parzay (Finistere), 1740; d. at Villevieux (Jura), 1813. Pupil, then professor, and finally principal of the College de Quimper, he took the constitutional <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in 1791, was elected <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ille-et-Vilaine, and wrote in defence of his election &mdash; declared null and void by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> &mdash; "Accord des vrais principes de la morale et de la raison sur la Constitution civile du clerg&eacute;". Elected to the Legislative Assembly he showed <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and ability in defending against the majority <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> costume, and even <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a>. His moderation drew upon him the severity of the Convention, and he spent fourteen months in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of Mont-Saint-Michel. Later, under the Directory, the vigour with which he opposed the substitution of the <em>decadi</em> for the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Christian Sunday</a> came near causing his deportation. Under the Concordat, Le Coz was one of the Constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom the force of circumstances compelled the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to recognize, and he became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>. There is a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the nature of his retractation: Bernier, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> diplomat who negotiated the rehabilitation of the jurors, thought it best, in order to avoid delay, not to make a clear mention of the manner of retractation required by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>; as a consequence, Le Coz denied ever having retracted, and the awkwardness of the situation was ended only by a personal interview between Le Coz and <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, in which both were seen weeping but of which neither ever spoke. As <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ille-et-Vilaine, Le Coz failed in his endeavour to organize the new province of which he was the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>; otherwise he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> administrator and even a charitable <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> he displayed some good qualities, but his sad antecedents, the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> hanging over his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, and the presence in his <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace of too many ex-juror <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, detracted considerably from the effectiveness of his ministry. The strange mixture of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in Le Coz's life, is partly explained by his intensely Gallican <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to adopt with apparent sincerity and to maintain with unconquerable obstinacy the most <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> views. His Gallicanism, which made him so haughty toward the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, found him almost cringing before the various political regimes which succeeded one another during his episcopate. In an age full of confusion, we should give some credit to Le Coz for sometimes having, even against the all-powerful Abb&eacute; Gr&eacute;goire, defended the cause of religion in the "Annales de la Religion", in which he was an assiduous collaborator, and in his "Correspondance", part of which has been published by his biographer.
