<h1>Claude de Lorrain</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and etcher, b. in 1600 at Chamagnc on the banks of the Moselle in Lorraine; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 21 Nov., 1681 (or 23 Nov., 1682). His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, Jean Gell&eacute;e and Anna Padose, poor and with a large <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, gave Claude little schooling. Left an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> at the age of twelve, he lived with an elder brother, a wood carver, at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, and there learned to draw ornaments and arabesques. Sandrart, a writer on art and Claude's friend, says that the boy was apprenticed to a pastry-cook; but <em>pistori</em> may have been a misprint for <em>pictori</em> (a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>). About 1613 a relative took Claude to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he appears to have abandoned the boy. Claude wandered to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> seeking Gottfried Wals, a Cologne artist, whose pictures he greatly admired. For two years Wals taught him <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> perspective and landscape <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. In 1615 Claude returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and became a member of the household of Agostino Tassi, who was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> a series of decorations for <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a>. Claude was half domestic servant and half artistic assistant to Tassi, who mentions him as a co-worker in decorating <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Cardinal Montalto's</a> palace. In 1625 Claude went to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, a city which deeply impressed him and his future work, and made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Virgin of Loretto for devotion and meditation. He then roamed through the Tyrol, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the Black Forest, and to Nancy where he worked for a year on <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. These wanderings impoverished his purse and his health and he longed for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to which he returned in 1627 to reside there until his death. The <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> welcomed him, and commissions from the illustrious of all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> poured in upon him. Among them were Popes <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>, <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> (Cardinal Rospigliosi), and <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, Emperor Leopold I, Philip IV of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the Duke of Bouillon (commander of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> forces), the Constable Colonna (Claude's patron of later years), and Cardinals Crescenzio, Poli, Giorio, and Spada.

<p>Claude was not only a faithful and absorbed student of nature but a tireless and rapid worker; in 1644 he completed seventeen important canvases. It is told that he took extraordinary care in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> one picture composed of trees of many kinds, a study he always kept beside his easel, and that he refused to sell it even to his best friend, Cardinal Rospigliosi, who offered to cover its surface twice over with gold pieces. Claude was the first original <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, the first original modern <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, and the first to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> effects instead of things. While his landscapes are thoroughly classic, they are above all ideal: "there are no landscapes in Nature like those of Claude" (Goethe). He would contemplate for hours--even days--one subject in nature, to which he would return in other weathers and conditions. Herein he resembled the modern Impressionists, one of whom, Pissaro, regards Claude as the forerunner of their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Claude "effected a revolution in art by setting the sun in the heavens" (Ruskin); and in the pictorial treatment of aerial perspective, in depth of background, and in delicate colour tones reflecting sunlight's myriad effects, he is unsurpassed. His earlier <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> was cool, bluish, and silvery; but he soon abandoned these tones for a rich, warm, and golden treatment of both landscape and marine. In figure <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> he did not excel; he sold his landscapes, he said, and gave away his figures.

<p>Claude united the lofty poetic feelings of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> with a <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> correctness and mastery of perspective; his compositions are symmetrical, yet free; and if he had a fault it was exaggerated gracefulness. Inspired by <a href="../cathen/03188a.htm">Callot</a>, whom perhaps he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, Claude began etching about 1629, and within a decade wrought the greater number of his (forty-two) plates. These are freely needled, carried to completeness, full of wonderful atmosphere, and suggestive of the colour and light pervading his oil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. Hamerton says that "there is an ineffable tenderness in his handling", and that his "Herdsman" is "the finest landscape etching in the world for technical quality". In 1662 Claude's interest in etching revived, and he executed two large plates, "Mercury and Argus" and "Time, Apollo, and the Seasons". Claude was one of the few great artists to be appreciated during his life; and such a demand arose for his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> that numerous forgeries of them were passed off as "Claudes". To frustrate such <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">frauds</a> he made drawings, washed with sepia or bistre, of all his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>; and these, about two hundred in all, constitute the "Liber Veritatis" (a treasure now possessed by the Duke of Devonshire). This collection, however, is far from containing all of Claude's drawings. Claude was of a reserved, contemplative, and religious temperament, kindly in disposition and generous. His favourite relaxation was music. During the last twenty years of his life he was in precarious health and tormented with attacks of gout. At his death he provided liberally for his nephew and his ward, Agnes, and bequeathed noble pictures to various Roman churches, also to his friend and patron Cardinal Rospigliosi "for the good advice he has always given me". Claude was buried in the church of Trinit&aacute; dei Monti; but on the recommendation of <a href="../cathen/14635b.htm">M. Thiers</a>, his remains were transported to the French church of San Liii in 1840.

<p>Of the one hundred and seventy-five canvases in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the "Bouillon Claudes", "Nuptials of Isaac and Rebecca", and "Embarcation of the Queen of Sheba" are world-famed, and became conspicuous under the terms of Turner's will. The Hermitage possesses twelve fine examples, among them the great series: "Morning", "Noon", "Evening", and "Night". <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> has seventeen, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> six, and the Vanderbilt collection four fine canvases. In Dresden is the "Dido and &AElig;neas". His best-known etchings are the "Herdsman", the "Ford", and the "Firework" series.
