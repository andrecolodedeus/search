<h1>Claude de Sainctes</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> controversialist, b. at Perche, 1525; d. at Cr&egrave;vecoeur, 1591. At the age of fifteen he joined the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of Saint-Cheron, and was sent to the College of Navarre in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he received the degree of Doctor of Theology (1555) On account of the erudition of his early works and the aptitude which he showed for controversy, he was called to the Conference of Poissy held in 1561 between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>, at which Theodore of Beza and Father Lainez, general of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, were present. He was afterwards deputed to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> to represent, with Simon Vigor, the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. Upon his return he acquired a notabgreputation by his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> and his discussions with <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. He published a work against their spoliation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches and a vigorous declaration against the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> and Theodore of Beza; the latter replied and drew upon himself a new attack from Claude de Sainctes. At the same time he charged the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by his treatise on "L'ancien naturel des Fran&ccedil;ais" never to tolerate <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and against these latter he defended the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by an exhaustive treatise on the Eucharist. Through the patronage of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine, he was appointed to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/05671a.htm">Evreux</a> (1575). He was very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in his efforts to convert <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. He assisted at the provincial Council of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> (1581) and published its records in French. When the League became active he took sides with it and worked to gain partisans, but the royal troops took possession of <a href="../cathen/05671a.htm">Evreux</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was forced to flee. Unfortunately for him there were found among his papers writings in which he approved the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Henry III and maintained that one could likewise kill his successor. Arrested and arraigned before the Parlement of Caen, he was condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> as guilty of high treason. At the request of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Bourbon and of several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Henry IV commuted his sentence to life <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, and he was confined in the ch&acirc;teau of Cr&egrave;vecoeur where he died two months later. His works were published, some in Latin and others in French. The more important are: "Liturgiae sive missae SS. Patrum Jacobi, Basilii J. Chrysostomi" (Greek-Latin, Paris, 1560); "Discours sur le saccagement des &eacute;glises catholiques par les h&eacute;r&eacute;tiques anciens et nouveaux calvinistes" (Paris, 1562); "Trait&eacute; de l'ancien naturel des Fran&ccedil;ais en la religion chr&eacute;tienne" (Paris, 1567); "D&eacute;claration d'anciens ath&eacute;ismes de la doctrine de Calvin et de B&egrave;ze contre les premiers fondements de la chr&eacute;tient&eacute;" (Paris, 1567); "De rebus Eucharistiae controversis libri X" (Paris, 1575).
