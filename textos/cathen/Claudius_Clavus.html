<h1>Claudius Clavus</h1>  

<p>(Or NICHOLAS NIGER.)

<p>The latinized form of the name of the old <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> cartographer Claudius Clauss&ouml;n Swart, born in the village of Salling, on the Island of F&uuml;nen, 14 September, 1388; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of death unknown. He was the first man to make a map of North-Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, which, moreover, included the first map of <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenland</a>. He was apparently an <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastic</a>. In the course of his frequent journeys he went to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where in 1424 he aroused much interest among the Humanists of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by announcing that in the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Soroe, near Roeskilde, he had seen three large volumes which contained the "Ten Decades" of Livy; according to his own statement he had read the titles of the chapters (<em>decem Livii decades, quarum capita ipse legisset</em>). Through his intercourse with the Humanists he became acquainted with the maps and descriptions of Ptolemy, and was thus led to supplement the work of Ptolemy by adding to it a chart and description of the North-West country. Clavus first turned his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Scandinavia and Greenland to account in the geographical drawing and description which has been preserved in the Ptolemy <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of 1427 of Cardinal Filiaster. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is now in the public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>. Descriptions of it have been repeatedly given by Waitz, Nordenskjold, Storm and others. The facsimile of Clavus's map and his description of the parts contained, which were published by Nordenkiold and Storm, show that he gave Greenland and Iceland the correct geographical position, namely, west of the Scandinavian Peninsula.

<p>Far more important, however, for the history of cartography is the second map and description of North-Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and Greenland that Clavus produced. As yet, unfortunately, the original of this work has not been found, nor does any copy contain both the map and the description. This second map has been preserved in the works of the German cartographers, <a href="../cathen/11068a.htm">Donnus Nicholas Germanus</a> and Henricus Martellus Germanus, who lived at Florence in the second half of the fifteenth century. Until recently, second descriptive text belonging to the map has only been known by the citations of Schoner and Friedlieb (Irenicus); the complete text was not known until it was found by Bjornbo in two <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> in the imperial library at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Bjornbo's discovery is especially important as it is now certain that Claudius Clavus was actually in <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenland</a> and that he claims to have pushed his journey along the west coast as far as 70&#176;10' N. lat. Another fact that lends importance to this discovery is that an explanation has at last been found for the incomprehensible names on the old maps of <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenland</a>. Local names in <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenland</a> and Iceland, so entirely different from those that appear in the <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Icelandic</a> sagas, for a long time served the defenders of the zeni as an argument that the map of <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenland</a> was the work of the elder Zeno. It is now clear from the list of names given by Clavus that the <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Icelandic</a> names on the map are not the real designations of places, but merely the names of Runic characters. In the same manner, when he came to <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenland</a>, Claudius Clavus used the recessive words of the first stanza of an old <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> folk-song, the scene of which is laid in <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenland</a>, to designate the headlands and rivers that seemed to him most worthy of note as he sailed from the north-east coast of coast. In the linguistic form of the words the dialect of the Island of F&uuml;nen is still evident. The discovery also makes clear how the younger Zeno was able to add to the forged story of a journey made in 1558 a comparatively correct map of the northern countries, and how he came to make use of the lines beginning: <em>Thaer boer eeynh manh ij eyn Groenenlandz aa</em> etc., which run in English: <blockquote> There lives a man on Greenland's stream, <br>And Spieldebodh doth he be named; <br>More has he of white herrings <br>Than he has pork that is fat. <br>From the north drives the sand anew. </blockquote>

<p>The second map of Clavus exercised a great influence on the development of cartography. As Clavus in drawing his map of North-Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and Greenland made use of all authorities to be had in his time, e.g. Ptolemy's <em>portolanos</em> (marine maps) and itineraries, so the map-makers of succeeding centuries adopted his map, either directly or indirectly: thus, in the fifteenth century, <a href="../cathen/11068a.htm">Donnus Nicholas Germanus</a> and Henricus Martellus; in the sixteenth century, <a href="../cathen/15531a.htm">Waldseemuller</a>, Nicol&ograve; Zeno, Rusclli, Moletius, Ramusio, Mercator, <a href="../cathen/11328b.htm">Ortelius</a>; in the seventeenth century, Hondius, Blaeu, and others; in the eighteenth century, Homann and his successors. It is evident that scarcely any other map has exerted so permanent an influence as of <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenland</a> by Claudius Clavus, "the first cartographer of America".
