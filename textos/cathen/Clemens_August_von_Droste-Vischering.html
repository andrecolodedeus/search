<h1>Clemens August von Droste-Vischering</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, born 21 Jan., 1773, at <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; died 19 Oct., 1845, in the same city. Besides attending the <a href="../cathen/10639a.htm">University of M&uuml;nster</a>, he had as private tutor the well-known church historian Theodore Katerkamp (died 1834). At an early age he was introduced into the circle of learned men that gathered around Baron von F&uuml;rstenberg and the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and refined <a href="../cathen/06367a.htm">Princess Amelia Von Gallitzin</a>, where he imbibed the thoroughly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles which characterized him while <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. After completing his studies he began, in June, 1796, an extensive <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> journey under the direction of Katerkamp, through <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, returning to M&uuml;nster in Aug., 1797. The following year, on 14 May, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by his brother Caspar Maximilian, then Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>. In accordance with the wish of the aged Baron von F&uuml;rstenberg, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> and Administrator of the <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter elected Clemens August as his coadjutor on 18 Jan., 1807, and when F&uuml;rstenberg resigned six months later, Clemens August became his successor. As administrator he founded in 1808 an independent congregation of <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, the so-called Klemens-Schwestern, who, though practically confined to the <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a>, numbered 81 houses and 1126 members in 1904. When in 1813 M&uuml;nster became part of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> monarchy, the emperor appointed Baron von Spiegel as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a> without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but after <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> fall the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> restored Clemens August to his former office in March, 1815. Under <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> rule the administrator repeatedly came into conflict with the Government on account of his attitude towards <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> and the supervision of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. When by an agreement between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> were again supplied with <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Clemens August, who was not <em>persona grata</em> to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government, withdrew from public life and devoted himself to works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and charity. He remained in seclusion even after being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a> with the titular See of <a href="../cathen/03148c.htm">Calama</a> in 1827.

<p>After the death of Baron von Spiegel, the incumbent of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Cologne, the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government, to the surprise of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> alike, desired Clemens August as his successor. This unexpected move on the part of the Government was intended to conciliate the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nobility of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> and <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Rhenish Prussia</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, who began to lose confidence in the fairmindedness of the Government and justly protested against the open favouritism shown to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of Cologne, which had become accustomed to act as a passive instrument in the hands of the Government, elected Clemens August as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> on 1 Dec., 1835. He received the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation on 1 Feb., 1836, and was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> by his brother, Maximilian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, on 29 May. Soon after this he came into conflict with the adherents of <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermes</a> (died 1831), whose doctrines (see <a href="../cathen/07276b.htm">HERMES AND HERMESIANISM</a>) had been condemned by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> on 26 Sept., 1835. When many professors at the <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">University of Bonn</a> refused to submit to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>, Clemens August refused the imprimatur to their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> magazine, forbade the students of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> to attend their lectures, and drew up a list of anti-Hermesian theses to which all candidates for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and all <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> who wished to be transferred to new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to swear adherence. The Government was angered because the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> had enforced the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> without the royal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, but gave him to understand that it would allow him free scope in this affair, provided he would accede to its demands concerning <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>. Before Clemens August became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> he was asked by an agent of the Government whether, if he should be set over a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he would keep in force the agreement regarding <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, which was made "in accordance with the papal Brief of 25 March, 1830", between Archbishop von Spiegel and Minister Bunsen on 19 June, 1834. Clemens August did not then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what this agreement consisted, and misled by the words "in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a>", answered in the affirmative. After becoming <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> he discovered that the agreement in question, far from being in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a>, was in some essential points in direct opposition to it. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> forbade <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to celebrate <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> unless the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> training of the children was guaranteed, while in the agreement between von Spiegel and Bunsen no such guarantee was required. Under these circumstances it was the plain <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to be guided by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a>, and all attempts of the Government to the contrary were futile. His conscientious devotion to <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> finally caused the Government to have recourse to the most drastic measures.

<p>Advised by Minister Bunsen, Frederick William III ordered the arrest of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The order was carried out in all haste and secrecy on the evening of 20 Nov., 1837, and Clemens August was transported as a criminal to the fortress of <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>. If the Government thought it could overawe the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> by thus trampling under foot the religious liberty of its subjects, it speedily discovered its mistake. The Bishops of M&uuml;nster and <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, fired by the example of Clemens August, recalled the assent they had formerly given to the agreement; while <a href="../cathen/05192c.htm">Martin von Dunin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and Posen, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Kolberg for the same offence that had sent Clemens August to Minden. In an Allocution of 10 Dec., 1837, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> praised the course of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> and solemnly protested against the action of the Government. The <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> "Darlegung", or expos&eacute;, in which the Government attempted to defend its course by accusing the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of treason, was refuted by Joseph G&ouml;rres in his great apologetical work "Athanasius", and a declaration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> state of affairs was published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by order of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The Government saw its mistake and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was set free on 22 April, 1839. He was permitted to retain the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, but, in order to uphold the authority of the State in the public eye, was prevailed upon to select a coadjutor in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Johann von Geissel (q.v.), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, who henceforth directed the affairs of the archdiocese. The <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> accusations of the above-mentioned "Darlegung" were publicly retracted by Frederick William IV, who had meanwhile succeeded Lo the throne. In 1844 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was most kindly received by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, which was offered him by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he refused with thanks and returned to M&uuml;nster in October. Clemens August is the author of a few ascetical and ecclesiastico-political works. The most important is an exposition of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> entitled "Ueber den Frieden unter der Kirche und den Staaten", published at M&uuml;nster in 1843.
