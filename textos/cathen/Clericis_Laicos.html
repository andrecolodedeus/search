<h1>Clericis Laicos</h1>  

<p>The initial words of a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> issued 25 Feb., 1296, by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> in response to an earnest appeal of the English and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> for protection against the intolerable exactions of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">B<font size=-2>ONIFACE</font> VIII</a>.) The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was inserted among the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> and is found in Lib. Sextus, III, tit. 23. After a preamble in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> complains that the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> are, and have always been, bitterly hostile to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; that, although they possess no authority over <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> or <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, they impose all sorts of heavy burdens on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and seek to reduce them to servitude; that several <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and other dignitaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, more fearful of giving offence to their earthly rulers than to the majesty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, acquiesce in these abuses, without having obtained authority or permission from the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>; he, therefore, wishing to put an end to these iniquitous proceedings, with the consent of his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and by Apostolic authority decrees that all <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> or other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors who under whatsoever pretext or colour shall, without authority from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, pay to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> any part of their income or of the revenue of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; also all emperors, kings, dukes, counts, etc. who shall exact or receive such payments incur <em>eo ipso</em> the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> from which, except <em>in articulo mortis</em>, no one can absolve them without special faculties from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; no privileges or <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> to be of avail against the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two underlying principles of this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, viz. (1) that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should enjoy equally with the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> the right of determining the need and the amount of their subsidies to the Crown, and (2) that the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to be consulted when there was question of diverting the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to secular purposes, were by no means strange or novel in that age of Magn&aelig; Chart&aelig; and outside of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it was accepted without a murmur. But what excited the wrath of the two chief culprits, <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> and Edward I, was that from its fiery tone, from the express mention of sovereigns, and the grave <em>ipso facto</em> penalties attached, they felt that behind the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> there stood a new <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> resolved to enforce it to the letter. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> has been criticized for the unconventional vehemence of its tone, for its exaggerated indictment of the hostile attitude of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of all ages towards the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and for its failure to make clear the distinction between the revenues of the purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and the lay fees held by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> on <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> tenure. The unscrupulous advisers of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> were quick to take advantage of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> hasty language and, by forcing him to make explanations, put him on the defensive and weakened his prestige.
