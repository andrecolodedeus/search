<h1>Clerks Regular</h1>  

<h2>Canonical status</h2>

<p>By <em>clerks regular</em> are meant those bodies of men in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who by the very nature of their institute unite the perfection of the religious state to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, i.e. who while being essentially <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, devoted to the exercise of the ministry in preaching, the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth, and other spiritual and corporal works of mercy, are at the same time religious in the strictest sense of the word, professing solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and living a community life according to a rule solemnly approved of by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/04391a.htm"><em>Corpus Juris Canonici</em></a> the term <em>clerks regular</em> is often used for <em>canons regular</em>, and regular clerks are classed by authors as a branch or modern adaptation of the once world-famous <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of regular canons (see <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">CANONS AND CANONESSES REGULAR</a>). This is because of the intimate connection existing between the two; for while separated from the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> by their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and the observance of a community life and a rule, they form a distinct class in the religious state, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a>, in opposition to the monastic, which includes <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>.

<p>Clerks regular are distinguished from the purely monastic bodies, or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, in four ways: <ul> <li>They are primarily devoted to the sacred ministry; not so the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, whose proper work is contemplation and the solemn celebration of the liturgy. <li>They are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to cultivate the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>, which, if cultivated by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, are yet not imposed upon them by virtue of their state of life. <li>Clerks regular as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> must retain some appearance of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> dress distinct from the habit and cowl of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. <li>And lastly, because of their occupations, they are less given to the practice of austerity which is a distinct feature of the purely monastic life. </ul>

<p>They are distinguished from the <em>friars</em> in this, that though the latter are devoted to the sacred ministry and the cultivation of learning, they are not primarily <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Finally, clerks regular differ from <em>canons regular</em> in that they do not possess <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or collegiate churches, devote themselves more completely to ministerial work in place of choir-service, and have fewer penitential observances of rule.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> at which clerks regular appeared in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot be absolutely determined. Regular clerks of some sort, i.e. <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> devoted both to the exercise of the ministry and to the practice of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, are found in the earliest days of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity. Many eminent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> hold that the clerks regular were founded by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. In this opinion the Apostles were the first regular clerks, being constituted by Christ <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> <em>par excellence</em> of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and called by Him personally to the practice of the counsels of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> (cf. Francisco Su&aacute;rez). From the fact that St. Augustine in the fourth century established in his house a community of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, leading the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, for whom he drew up a rule, he has ordinarily been styled the founder of the regular clerks and canons, and upon his rule have been built the constitutions of the canons regular and an immense number of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, besides those of the clerks regular established in the sixteenth century. During the whole <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a> the clerks regular were represented by the regular canons who under the name of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> or Black Canons of St. Augustine, the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> or White Canons, Canons of St. Norbert, etc., shared with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> the possession of those magnificent <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> which, even though they are in ruins, compel the admiration of the beholder.

<p>It was not until the sixteenth century that clerks regular in the modern and strictest sense of the word came into being. Just as the conditions obtaining in the thirteenth century brought about a change in the monastic ideal, so in the sixteenth the altered circumstances of the times called for a fresh development of the ever fecund religious spirit in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This development, adapted to the needs of the times, was had in the various bodies of simple <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, who, desirous of devoting themselves more perfectly to the exercise of their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> ministry under the safeguards of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, instituted the several bodies which, under the names of the various orders or <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, constitute in themselves and in their imitators one of the most efficient instruments for good in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant today. So successful and popular and well adapted to all modern needs were the clerks regular, that their mode of life was chosen as the pattern for all the various communities of men, whether religious or secular, living under rule, in which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has in recent times been so prolific. The first order of clerks regular to be founded were the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a> established at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1524; then followed the Clerks Regular of the Good Jesus, founded at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> in 1526, and abolished by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> in 1651; the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> or Clerks Regular of St. Paul, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1530; The <a href="../cathen/14140a.htm">Somaschi</a> or Clerks Regular of St. Majolus, Somasca, 1532; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> or the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, Paris, 1534; the <a href="../cathen/04052b.htm">Regular Clerks of the Mother of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, 1583; the Regular Clerks Ministering to the Sick, Rome, 1584; the Minor Clerks Regular, Naples, 1588; and the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a> or Regular Clerks of the Mother of God of the Pious Schools, Rome, 1597. Since the close of the sixteenth century no new orders have been added to the number, though the name Clerks Regular has been assumed occasionally by communities that are technically only religious, or <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, congregations (see RELIGIOUS CONGREGATIONS).
