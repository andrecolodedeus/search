<h1>Clerks Regular of the Mother of God of Lucca</h1>  

<p>Clerks Regular of the Mother of God of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, a congregation founded by the Blessed Giovanni Leonardi, son of middle-class <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who was born in 1541 at Diecimo, a small township in the Republic of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, though at that time the chief place of a fief of the same name held by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> from the republic. At seventeen years of age he was sent to Lucca to learn the apothecary's trade, but having from a tender age been most piously inclined, he, after many difficulties, including the necessity of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> himself, embraced the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> state, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 22 December, 1572. His congregation may be said to have begun in 1574. Two or three young <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, attracted by his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and the sweetness of his character, had gathered round him to submit themselves to his spiritual guidance and help him in the work for the reform of manners and the saving of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which he had begun even as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. Giovanni rented the beautiful little church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> della Rosa, and in a quarter close by, something like community life was started. It was here, when it became evident that Giovanni's lay helpers were preparing for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and that something like a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order was in process of formation, that a storm of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> broke out against the devoted founder. The Fathers of the republic seem to have had a real fear that a native <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, if spread over <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, would cause the affairs of the little state to become too well known to its neighbours. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, however, was so effective and lasting, that the Blessed Leonardi practically spent the rest of his life in banishment from <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, only being now and again admitted by special <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Senate, unwillingly extracted under <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> pressure. In 1580 Giovanni acquired secretly the ancient church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Cortelandini (popularly known as Santa Maria Nera) which his sons hold to this day. In 1583 the congregation was canonically erected at the instigation of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> by Bishop Alessandro Guidiccioni, of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, and confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> "Ex quo divina majestas", 13 October, 1595.

<p>The congregation at this time only took simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of chastity, perseverance, and obedience, and was known as the "Congregation of Clerks Secular of the Blessed Virgin". In 1596 <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> nominated the Blessed Giovanni commissary Apostolic for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Order of <a href="../cathen/10538b.htm">Monte Vergine</a>, and in 1601 the <a href="../cathen/03341a.htm">cardinal protector</a> appointed him to carry out a similar work among the <a href="../cathen/15262a.htm">Vallombrosans</a>. In 1601 he obtained the church of S. Maria in Portico in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the same year Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> became protector of the congregation. Giovanni died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 9 October, 1609, aged sixty-eight, and was buried in Santa Maria in Portico. The present church of the congregation in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, obtained in 1662, is Santa Maria in Campitelli (called also Santa Maria in Portico) interesting to Englishmen as the first titular church of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of York. The body of the founder was removed to this church and lies there under the altar of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>. Giovanni Leonardi was declared Venerable in 1701, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1861. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, in 1893, caused his name to be inserted in the Roman Martyrology and ordered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to say his <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> and <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a>, an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> accorded to no other Blessed in that city except the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. In 1614 <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> confided to the congregation the care of the so-called Pious Schools. It is in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Inter Pastoralis" that the congregation is first called "of the Mother of God", having until then been known by its original name of "Clerks Secular of the Blessed Virgin". The care of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> being considered outside the scope of the congregation, it was relieved of their charge by the same pontiff in 1617.

<p>It was not until 1621 (3 November) that <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, carrying out what was always in the founder's mind, erected the congregation into a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order proper by permitting its members to take solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and it henceforth became the <a href="../cathen/04051d.htm">Clerks Regular</a> of the Mother of God. The Blessed Leonardi received many offers of churches during his life, but with a view of conciliating the governing body of the republic thought it better to refuse them. In all its history the order has never had more than fifteen churches, and never more than seven at one time. It was introduced into <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> in 1632, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> 1669, and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> 1709. The only churches of the order now existing are Santa Maria Cortelandini, Lucca; Santa Maria in Campitelli, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; Santa Maria in Portico di Chiaja, and Santa Brigida, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; the Madonna della Stella Migliano (1902); and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of S. Carlo in Monte Carlo (1873), the only church of the order outside the borders of modern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Cortelandini is preserved a large portion of a hair-shirt of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a> whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated there with considerable <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>; in 1908 half of this <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was presented to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of St. Thomas, Erdington, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The former residence of the clerks, who kept a large boys' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> until the suppression in 1867, is now the public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>. Two of the original companions of the holy founder, Cesare Franciotti and Giovanni Cioni, have been declared Venerable. The order justly enjoys great fame for its learning and its numerous scholars and writers. Suffice it to mention Giovanni Domenico <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, editor of the "Councils" and a hundred other works. The arms of the order are azure, Our Lady Assumed into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>; and its badge and seal the monogram of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> in Greek characters.
