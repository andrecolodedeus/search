<h1>Cleveland</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of Cleveland (Clevelandensis), established 23 April, 1847, comprises all that part of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> lying north of the southern limits of the Counties of Columbiana, Stark, Wayne, Ashland, Richland, Crawford, Wyandot, Hancock, Allen, and Van Wert, its territory covering thirty-six counties, an area of 15,032 square miles.
<h2>Early history</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> Potier and Bonnecamp were the first missionaries to visit the territory now within the limits of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. They came from Quebec in 1749 to evangelize the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron Indians</a> living along the Vermilion and Sandusky Rivers in Northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. Two years later they received the assistance of another <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father de la Richardie, who had come from <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, to the southern shore of Lake Erie. Shortly after his arrival he induced a part of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> tribe to settle near the present site of Sandusky, where he erected a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> &#151; the first place of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship within the present limits of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. These <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> assumed the name of Wyandots when they left the parent tribe. Although checked for a time by Father Potier, they took part in the Indian-French War. Soon they became implicated in the conspiracy of Pontiac, in consequence of which the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> forced in 1752 to leave the territory of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, Father Potier being the last <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary among the Western <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a>. The Indian missions, established and cared for by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> for nearly three years, had now to depend exclusively on the chance visits of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attached to the military posts in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and Southern Michigan. Despite the spiritual deprivation which this implied, the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> (Wyandots) kept the Faith for many years, although their descendants were ultimately lost to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through the successful efforts of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionaries. After the forced retirement of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> no systematic efforts were made to continue the missionary work begun by them until 1795, when the Rev. Edmund Burke, a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> from Quebec, came as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the military post at Fort Meigs, near the present site of Maumee. Father Burke remained at the post until February, 1797, ministering to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> soldiers at the fort, and endeavouring though with little success, to Christianize the Ottawa and <a href="../cathen/03690a.htm">Chippewa</a> Indians, in the neighbourhood.

<p>In the meantime the See of Bardstown was erected (1810), embracing the entire <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">State of Ohio</a>, as well as Michigan and Kentucky. Bishop Flaget sent (1817) the Rev. Edward Fenwick, O.P. (later first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>), from the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Somerset, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, to attend the few <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> who had settled in Columbiana and Stark Counties, in the north-eastern part of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. From that time forward he and other <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers, especially the Revs. Nicholas D. Young and John A. Hill, continued to visit at regular intervals the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in that section of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> (notably in Columbiana, Stark, Mahoning, and Wayne Counties), then very sparsely settled. It is, therefore, from this period that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in Northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> really dates its beginning. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers gradually gave up to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> their pastoral charges in the above-named counties until, in 1842, they withdrew altogether. St. John's, Canton, was their last mission. Meanwhile the central portion of Northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> (Huron, <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Erie</a>, Sandusky, and Seneca Counties) had received a considerable influx of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigrants, principally from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Similar conditions were obtaining elsewhere in the State, and the need of more compact organization to minister to growing wants made Cincinnati an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> in 1822, with the entire State for its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Little seems to have been done, however, for the northern part of the State, and but little could be done, as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were so few, until the advent of its second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">John B. Purcell</a>. He succeeded (13 Oct., 1833) the saintly Bishop Fenwick, who, while engaged in a confirmation tour, died at Wooster, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> (26 September, 1832) of cholera, then raging in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. In 1834 <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell</a> commissioned the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a>, who had just arrived in America, to take charge of the widely scattered German missions then existing in these counties, and to organize others where needed. The Rev. Francis X. Tschenhens, C.SS.R., was the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> assigned to this task. Later on he was assisted by other members of his community, among them the Revs. Peter Czakert, Francis Haetscher, Joseph Prost, Simon Saenderl, Louis M. Alig, and John N. Neumann (later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia). The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> remained in Northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> until November, 1842. They were succeeded, January, 1844, by seven Sanguinist Fathers, (the Revs. <a href="../cathen/03012a.htm">Francis S. Brunner</a>, M.A. Meier, J. Wittmer, J. Van den Broek, P.A. Capeder, J. Ringele, and J.B. Jacomet), who came from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> at that time at the solicitation of <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell</a>. They settled at St. Alphonsus church, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, Huron County, whence they attended all the missions formerly under the care of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>. They also accepted charge of the scattered missions in Lorain, Medina, and Wayne Counties, besides attending the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Germans in Cleveland. Their advent was hailed with delight wherever they went, and their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> labours were signally blessed. Under their vigilant care religion flourished, so that the healthy growth of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in Northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> may justly, under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be ascribed in large measure to their untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and self-sacrifice.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> are no less deserving of mention, as they, too, laboured in this part of the Lord's vineyard, amid trials and difficulties, often side by side with their brethren of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and more often alone in the widespread missions of Northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. They did yeoman service, blazing the way for those who succeeded them, and laying the foundations for many missions, which have long since developed into vigorous and prosperous congregations. The first of these <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> was the Rev. Ignatius J. Mullen of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. Between 1824 and 1834 he frequently attended the missions in Stark, Columbiana, Seneca, and Sandusky Counties. Other pioneer <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> of prominence were the Revs. Francis Marshall (1827), John M. Henni (later Bishop and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>), resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Canton (1831-34), Edmund Quinn, at Tiffin (1831-35), William J. Horstmann, at Glandorf (1835-43), James Conlon, at Dungannon (1834-53), Matthias Wuerz, at Canton (1835-45), John Dillon, first resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Cleveland (1835-36), Basil Schorb, in charge of missions in Stark, Wayne, and Portage Counties (1837-43), Patrick O'Dwyer, second <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Cleveland (1836-38), where he built the first church in 1838, Michael McAleer, in Stark and Columbiana Counties (1838-40), Joseph McNamee, at Tiffin (1839-47), Projectus J. Machebeuf (later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04733c.htm">Denver</a>), at Tiffin and Sandusky (1839-51), Amadeus Rappe (later first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cleveland), stationed at Maumee for a short time, and then, as first resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, at Toledo (1840-47), Louis de Goesbriand (later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, Vermont), at <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, Toledo, and Cleveland (1840-53), Peter McLaughlin, resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Cleveland (1840-46), Maurice Howard, at Cleveland and later at Tiffin (1842-52), John J. Doherty, at Canton (1843-48), John H. Luhr, at Canton, and later at Cleveland (1844-58), John O. Bredeick, founder of Delphos and its first <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> (1844-58), Cornelius Daley, first resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Akron, and later stationed at Doylestown (1844-47), Philip Foley, at Massillon and Wooster (1847-48). The <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Rev. Stephen Badin</a>, proto-priest of the thirteen original <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and the Rev. Edward T. Collins occasionally came from <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, between 1835 and 1837, to attend the missions in Northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, the former those of Canton, Fremont, and Tiffin, and the latter those of Dungannon, Toledo, and along the Maumee River. The first permanent church in Northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> was erected near the present village of Dungannon, in 1820, under the direction of the Rev. Edward Fenwick, O.P., the "Apostle of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>," and later the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. Until 1847 churches of brick or wood were built in the following places: Canton (St. John's, 1823), Chippewa (1828), Randolph, Canal Fulton (1831), Tiffin (St. Mary's, 1832), Glandorf, <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, New Riegel (1833), <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> (1834), <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, La Porte (1835), Shelby Settlement (1836), McCutchenville (1837), Thompson (1839), Cleveland, East Liverpool (1840), Toledo, Maumee, New Washington, Norwalk (1841), Sandusky (Holy Angels), Landeck, Liberty, <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, Sheffield (St. Stephen's, 1842), Delphos, Massillon (St. Mary's), Akron (St. Vincent's), Fremont (St. Anne's), French Creek (1844), Canton (St. Peter's), <a href="../cathen/07143a.htm">Harrisburg</a>, New Berlin, Tiffin (St. Joseph's), Providence (1845), Sherman (1846), Poplar Ridge (1847).

<p>From 1922 until October, 1847, Northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> was part of the <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Diocese of Cincinnati</a>, of which the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Edward Fenwick (1822-32), and its second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">John B. Purcell</a>, who succeeded in October, 1833. He petitioned the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in 1846, for a division of his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, then comprising the entire <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">State of Ohio</a>. The petition was granted (23 April, 1847), by the appointment of the Rev. Louis Amadeus Rappe as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cleveland, and the assignment to his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of "all that part of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> lying north of 40 degrees and 41 minutes, N.L." As this division intersected several counties it was changed in January, 1849, to the present limits, as described at the beginning of this article.
<h2>Bishops of Cleveland</h2>

<p>(1) LOUIS AMADEUS RAPPE, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 10th October, 1847, was born 2 Feb., 1801, at Andrehem, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 14 March, 1829. His <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> was St. Mary's on the "Flats," Cleveland, the first, and at that time the only, church in his episcopal city. In November, 1852, he completed the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, an imposing brick structure of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>, still ranking with the many fine churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. During his administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which ended in August, 1870, he convoked five <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> (1848, 1852, 1854, 1857, 1868). He established the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1848), St. John's College, Cleveland (1854), St. Louis College, Louisville (1866); these two colleges, however, being closed a few years later, owing to lack of patronage. Under his direction the following <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> were also established: in Cleveland, the Ursuline Academy; St. Vincent's Orphanage, for boys; St. Mary's Orphanage, for girls (1861); St. Joseph's Orphanage, for girls (1862); Charity Hospital (1865); House of the Good Shepherd (1869); Home for the Aged Poor (1870).

<p>In Toledo, Ursuline Academy (1854), St. Vincent's Orphanage (1855); in Tiffin, Ursuline Academy (1863), St. Francis' Asylum and Home for the Aged (1867). He founded the community of Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine (1851), whose work is the care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, waifs, and the sick. In 1869 he introduced into the diocese the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Fathers, giving to the former the care of St. Joseph's church, Cleveland, and to the latter St. Mary's, Toledo. Wherever possible he insisted on the support of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. He was a strong advocate of total abstinence, which he practised from the time he was a missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in North-Western <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> until his death. He never spared himself in the discharge of his manifold and exacting <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. By his affability and disinterestedness he gained the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of his people, as also the respect of his fellow-citizens regardless of creed. He resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in August, 1870, and retired to the <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Diocese of Burlington</a>, <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, where he did missionary work almost to the day of his death (8 September, 1877). Between the time of Bishop Rappe's resignation and the appointment of his successor, the Very Rev. Edward Hannin administered the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>(2) RICHARD GILMOUR, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 14 April, 1872. In November of the same year he convoked the Sixth Diocesan Synod, in which many of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is at present governed were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. It also embodied considerable of the legislature of previous <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, notably that of 1868. This synod made provision for a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> fund for the support of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, etc., and another for the support of sick and disabled <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, by annual assessments on the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Among other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> published then were those urging anew the support of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, regulating the financial affairs of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and the manner of electing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> councilmen and of conveying <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. Bishop Gilmour established "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Universe," its first issue appearing 4 July, 1874. In 1875 he organized "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Central Association," composed of representatives from all the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and church <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in Cleveland; its influence for the betterment of social and religious conditions and for the defence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests was soon felt not only in Cleveland, but elsewhere as well, and continued during almost its entire existence of nearly eighteen years. It also <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a tower of strength to its organizer in his forced contention for the civic <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, in the face of bitter opposition from bigotry and a hostile press. In 1875 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in Cleveland was placed on the tax duplicate in spite of the decision (1874) of the Supreme Court of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, that such <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was not taxable. A suit of restraint was entered by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and finally carried to the Supreme Court, which reaffirmed its former decision. The present episcopal residence was begun in 1874 and completed two years later. It serves also as the residence of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<p>In 1872 the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, and in 1874 the Sisters of Notre Dame, were welcomed to the diocese. Both communities have flourishing academies in connexion with their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, besides supplying many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with efficient teachers. The same also is the case with the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> of Cleveland, Tiffin, Toledo, and Youngstown, and the Sisters of the Humility of Mary.

<p>The following institutions were established between 1873 and 1891: St. Anne's Asylum and House of Maternity, Cleveland (1873); <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Convent, Youngstown (1874); St. Vincent's Hospital, Toledo (1876); St. Joseph's <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> College, Cleveland (1876-80); Convent of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> (1877); Ursuline Academy, Nottingham (1877); St. Alexis' Hospital, Cleveland (1884); St. Louis' Orphanage, Louisville (1884); <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, Toledo (1885); St. Ignatius' College, Cleveland (1886); St. Joseph's Seminary, for young boys, Nottingham (1886). The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was remodelled and considerably enlarged in 1884-85. A <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">diocesan chancery office</a> was established (1877) for the transaction of the official business of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1878 the first attempt was made to gather historical data in connexion with every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and institution in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and in a few years a great mass of matter, covering the history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in Northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> and the Diocese of Cleveland as far back as 1817, was collected and is now a part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> archives. In May, 1882, the Seventh Diocesan Synod was held, which resulted in the legislation at present in force. With the exception of about half a dozen of its 262 <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, it is in perfect harmony with the decrees of the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, held in November, 1884. Like his predecessor, Bishop Gilmour made it <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> at all financially able to support a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In consequence, the Diocese of Cleveland has more <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, in proportion to its number of churches and its population, than any other diocese in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and many of its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> buildings vie, in size, appointments, and beauty of architecture, with the public-school buildings. With very few exceptions the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are in charge of teachers belonging to male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, Bishop Gilmour had an eventful episcopate, lasting nineteen years. He left his strong, aggressive <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> indelibly stamped, upon the diocese he had ruled. During the interim between his death (13 April, 1891) and the appointment of his successor, the Rev. Monsignor F.M. Boff was administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>(3) IGNATIUS FREDERICK HORSTMANN, chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/11793b.htm">Archdiocese of Philadelphia</a>, was appointed to succeed Bishop Gilmour. Born in Philadelphia, 16 December, 1840, after graduating from the Central High School, he attended St. Joseph's College and then entered the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> Seminary. In 1860 he was sent by Bishop Wood to the American College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 10 June, 1865. In the following year he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity and returning to Philadelphia became a professor in St. Charles's Seminary where he remained eleven years and was then appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Mary's church, Philadelphia. In 1885 he was made chancellor. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cleveland took place in Philadelphia, 25 February, 1892. He died suddenly of heart disease on 13 May, 1908, while on an official visit to Canton, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. He had proved himself a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, a wise and prudent ruler, a fearless defender of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Among the noteworthy accomplishments of his episcopate were the founding of Loyola High School, Cleveland (1902); St. John's College, Toledo (1898); and the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> band of missionaries &#151; the first in any diocese of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. He was foremost in encouraging every missionary movement, and his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was one of the dominant purposes of his life. He served as a trustee of the Catholic University and in spite of many <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> found time to contribute to the "American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Review" and other periodicals and to edit the American edition of "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Doctrine As Defined by the Council of Trent" and "Potter's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Bible."

<p>A few months before he died he asked for an <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the growing foreign population, especially of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> races, in the diocese. The Rev. Joseph M. Koudelka, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Michael's church, Cleveland, was named, 29 Nov., 1907, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 25 Feb., 1908, being the first <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> of special <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> appointed for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. He was born in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, 15 August, 1852, and <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> when sixteen years of age. After making his studies at St. Francis's Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 8 October, 1875. He was for some time editor of "Hlas" (Voice), a <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly paper, and compiled a series of textbooks for <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.
<h2>Recent times</h2>

<p>In 1894 the "St. Vincent's Union," composed of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> who contribute towards the support of St. Vincent's Orphanage, Cleveland, was organized; and it has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of great financial assistance to that institution. In 1893 Bishop Horstmann opened the Calvary Cemetery, which covers nearly 250 acres, near the southern limits of Cleveland. About fifty acres of the cemetery's whole area are improved. In 1892 the Cleveland Apostolate was established, an association of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, having for its object the giving of lectures and missions to non-Catholics. Besides making many converts this association has removed much prejudice and brought about a kindlier feeling towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its members. The Golden Jubilee of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was celebrated, 13 October, 1897. It was a memorable event, observed with great religious pomp in Cleveland, Toledo, and elsewhere. At the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> solicitation the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> of Toledo opened (September, 1898) St. John's College. In the same city a home for fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was established (1906) by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. A fine <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> building was erected (1906) in connexion with St. Vincent's Asylum, Cleveland, in which the boys have every facility for a thorough <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is in a prosperous condition, spiritually and financially, and healthy growth is apparent in every direction.
<h2>Causes of growth</h2>

<p>The growth of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> population down to 1860 was due chiefly to emigration from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Since 1870 it has been receiving other large accessions, but from quite another source. The <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> race, manifold in its divisions, has been pouring in, more notably since 1895. The early immigrants were drawn hither by the market for their labour which the opening of a new country offered. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> found employment on public works, such as the construction of canals and railroads; the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> turned more to agriculture. The various branches of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> race are engaged in foundries, mills, and factories, and many are also employed as longshoremen and at common labour. The same holds also for the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, of whom there is a large percentage. Nearly all the recent immigration has settled in cities like Cleveland, Toledo, Youngstown, Lorain, and Ashtabula, where employment is had in abundance and at a fair wage.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>In December, 1907, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> numbered 388, of whom 315 were <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 73 regulars (Sanguinists, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>). There were 21 Brothers of Mary and 5 <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, teaching in 6 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The Sisters (Sanguinists, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine, Sisters of Notre Dame, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, Ladies of the Sacred Heart of Mary, Sisters of the Humility of Mary, <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a>, Sisters of the Good Shepherd, <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Sisters of St. Agnes, Sisters of Charity, Sisters of Loretto, <a href="../cathen/06027b.htm">Felician Sisters</a>, Sisters of St. Benedict, Sisters-Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary) number 1141, of whom 684 teach in 138 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> number 241; mission churches, 60; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 186; attendance, 43,544; 1 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 96 students; <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> students in colleges and other <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, 45; colleges and academies for boys, 4; attendance, 515 pupils; academies for girls, 11; attendance, 2113 pupils; 9 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and one <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylum</a>, total number of inmates, 1251; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 9; homes for the aged, 3; Houses of Good Shepherd, 2.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is about 330,000, and is composed of 13 nationalities, exclusive of native Americans, viz., Irish, German, Slovak, Polish, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, Magyar, Slovenian, Italian, Lithuanian, Croatian, <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumanian</a>, Ruthenian, Syrian.
