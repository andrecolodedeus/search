<h1>Clifton</h1>  

<p>(Cliftoniensis).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, consisting of Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, and Wiltshire. It was founded by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> when he restored the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1850. Previously to that the diocese formed part of the Western District, one of the four vicariates established by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> in 1688, and including <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> and the six south-western counties of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In 1840 <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> became a separate vicariate, and thenceforth the district consisted of the English counties only. As the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> resided chiefly at <a href="../cathen/02347a.htm">Bath</a> in Somerset, when the district was divided into the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Clifton and Plymouth, it was fitting that the last <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Western District, Dr. Joseph William Hendren, O.S.F. (1791-1866), <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1848, should become the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Clifton. Thus the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is, in a special sense, the representative of the old vicariate. In this capacity the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Clifton retains possession of the archives of the Western District, one of the most important sources of information for the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> from 1780 to 1850. The papers earlier in date perished during the <a href="../cathen/06649c.htm">Gordon Riots</a> in 1780. Besides these valuable archives there is at Bishop's House an interesting series of portraits of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> of the Western District and of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Clifton.

<p>A year after the foundation of the new diocese Dr. Hendren was translated to the <a href="../cathen/11133a.htm">See of Nottingham</a> and was succeeded by Dr. Thomas Burgess (1791-1854). On 28 June, 1852, a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, consisting of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and ten canons, was erected. On the death of Bishop Burgess, 27 Nov., 1854, there was a long vacancy, and the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was given provisionally to Archbishop Errington, coadjutor to <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>. This arrangement lasted until Feb., 1857, when the Hon. and Rev. William Joseph Hugh Clifford (1823-1893), son of the seventh Lord Clifford, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> in person. His long pontificate lasted for thirty-six years, ending with his death, 14 Aug., 1893. His successor was Dr. William Robert Brownlow (1836-1901), famous as an archaeologist, and whose well-known work on the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, written conjointly with <a href="../cathen/11111a.htm">Dr. James Spencer Northcote</a>, is a classical work of reference. Dr. Brownlow died 9 Nov., 1901, and was succeeded by the Rt. Rev. George Ambrose Burton, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1 May, 1902. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which is under the patronage of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">"Our Lady Conceived without Sin"</a> and Sts. Peter and Paul, is divided into six rural deaneries. There are 57 public <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, besides 24 private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> belonging to communities. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> number about 50 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and about 80 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regulars</a>, the latter including the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of the famous <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> are also represented in the diocese. The College of Sts. Peter and Paul, Prior Park, founded by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and afterwards conducted by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, is now in the hands of the Fathers of the Society of the Holy Ghost.
