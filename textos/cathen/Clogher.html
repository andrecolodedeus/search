<h1>Clogher</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF CLOGHER (CLOGHERENSIS)

<p>A suffragan of Armagh, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, which comprises the County Monaghan, almost the whole of Fermanagh, the southern portion of Tyrone, and parts of Donegal, Louth, and Cavan. It takes its name from Clogher, the seat of the Prince of Oriel, with whose territory the old Diocese of Clogher was, practically speaking, coextensive. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was founded by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, who appointed one of his household, St. Macarten, as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. There does not seem to be any evidence that <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> governed Clogher as a distinct diocese before taking up his residence at <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, as is stated by Jocelyn. There is great difficulty in tracing the succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in Clogher, as indeed in every <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> diocese from the sixth to the eleventh century, on account of the confusion of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the monastic establishments; the difficulty is increased in Clogher in view of the diversity existing between the lists as given in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Annals, and the "Register of Clogher", compiled by Patrick Culin, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Clogher (1519-34), and Roderick Cassidy, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The "Register of Clogher" is of very little historical value.

<p>In 1241 Henry III ordered that Clogher should be united to <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, on account of the poverty of both <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, but this was not carried out, though under Bishop David O'Brogan large portions of Tyrone were cut off from Clogher and given to Ardstraw (now united with Derry), while the greater part of the present County Louth, including Dundalk, Drogheda, and Ardee, was taken over by Armagh. In 1535 Bishop Odo, or Hugh O'Cervallan, was appointed to the See of Clogher by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, and on the submission of his patron Con O'Neill to <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> seems to have accepted the new teaching and was superseded by Raymond MacMahon, 1546. From his time there are two lines of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in Clogher, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> Miler Magrath was appointed <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by Queen Elizabeth in 1570, but on his promotion to <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, resigned Clogher in the same year. <a href="../cathen/16058a.htm">Heber or Emer MacMahon</a> (1643-50) took a prominent part in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Confederates, and on the death of <a href="../cathen/11253a.htm">Owen Roe O'Neill</a>, was chosen general of the Confederate forces. He was defeated at Scariffhollis near Letterkenny, taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by Coote, and beheaded at Enniskillen. Owing to the persecutions of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Clogher was governed by vicars during the periods 1612-43, 1650-71, 1687-1707, 1713-27. The chapter of Clogher was allowed to lapse, but towards the end of the eighteenth century it was re-established by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a>.

<p>A very important provincial synod was held at Clones in 1670 by <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Oliver Plunkett</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a> (see Moran, Life of Plunkett). The most remarkable shrines of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are at St. Patrick's, Lough Derg, near Pettigo, still frequented by thousands of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> from all parts of the world (see <a href="../cathen/12580a.htm">ST. PATRICK'S PURGATORY</a>); Devenish Island in Lough Erne (see McKenna, Devenish, its History and Antiquities, Dublin, 1897); Innismacsaint, also in Lough Erne, where the "Annals of Ulster" were composed; Lisgoole, Clones, and Clogher. The most celebrated works of ancient ecclesiastical art connected with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are the Domnach Airigid, a shrine enclosing a copy of the Gospels, said to have been given by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> to St. Macarten, and the Cross of Clogher, both of them now in the National Museum in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is 101,162, distributed in forty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and ministered to by about 100 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
