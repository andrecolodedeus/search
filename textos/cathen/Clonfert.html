<h1>Clonfert</h1>  

<p>(Clonfertensis, in Irish <em>Cluain-fearta Brenainn</em>).

<p>The Diocese of Clonfert, a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> province of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, was founded in 557 by <a href="../cathen/02758c.htm">St. Brendan</a> the Navigator, in a sheltered <em>cluain</em> or meadow near the Shannon shore, at the eastern extremity of the County <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was nearly coextensive with the tribe-land of the Hy Many or O'Kelly country. It still contains twenty-four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the south-east of the County <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, including one small <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> east of the Shannon, which formed a part of the ancient Hy Many territory. The renown of Brendan as a saint and traveller by land and sea attracted from the very beginning many <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and students to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Clonfert, so that it became a very famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning, numbering at one time, it is said, no less than three thousand students. Brendan was not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself, but he had as coadjutor, his nephew, Moinenn, who, after his death, became an abbot-bishop and head of the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. At a later period a still more celebrated man, Cummian Fada, or Cummian the Tall, presided over the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and Diocese of Clonfert. He took a leading part in the famous Paschal controversy and wrote a very learned work on the subject, known as his "Paschal Epistle", which fortunately still survives (P.L., LXXXVIII) and furnishes conclusive evidence of the varied learning cultivated in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Clonfert.

<p>Clonfert being on the highway of the Shannon suffered greatly from the ravages of the Danes, and also of some <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> chieftains who imitated their bad example; yet the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> lived on through those stormy times, and we have a fuller list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Clonfert than we have of any other see, at least in the West of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. It was richly endowed with large estates of fertile land, and hence we find that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Clonfert, according to a scale fixed in 1392, paid to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury on his appointment three hundred florins in gold, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a> being taxed only at two hundred florins. At the <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">general suppression of religious houses</a> by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, the Abbot O'Gormacan, with the help of Clanrickarde, contrived to hold the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> lands of Clonfert until his death in spite of royal decrees. Roland de Burgo became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1534, and being an uncle of the Earl of Clanrickarde was able to keep his lands and his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for more than forty years under Henry, Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth. He was always a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, although it is probable that he took the Oath of Supremacy in order to get the temporalities from <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. Queen Elizabeth wrote to Sir H. Sydney suggesting the founding of a national <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at Clonfert, on account of its central position on the highway of the lordly river, to be endowed with the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> lands. But the project was never carried out.

<p>The old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Clonfert still exists, and is one of the few ancient churches still used for religious worship, for it was seized by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in the reign of Elizabeth and has continued since in their hands. There is, however, practically no <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> congregation. The church was small, being only fifty-four by twenty-seven feet in the clear, but its two characteristic features, the west doorway and the east windows, are very beautiful examples of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Romanesque. Brash, and expert authority, has described the doorway with great minuteness, and declares that in point of design and execution it is not excelled by any similar work that he has seen in these islands. Of the east altar-window he says, "the design is exceedingly chaste and beautiful, the mouldings simple and effective, and the workmanship superior to any I have seen either of ancient or modern times." He attributes the building of this beautiful Romanesque church to Peter O'Mordha, a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Boyle and afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Clonfert. He belonged to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the highest artistic genius, to whom we also owe the noble arches of the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, and the beautiful <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cong.

<p>In 1266, as we learn from the annals of Lough Ce', a certain John was sent over from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as Bishop-elect of the See of Clonfert. He must have received the sanction of the crown, and could not have been inducted to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> without the help of Walter de Burgo, Earl of Ulster. Hence we are told he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at the English town of <a href="../cathen/02043a.htm">Athenry</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Clonfert. This was on the Sunday before <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1266. He was also appointed <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a>, and we find (apud <a href="../cathen/14565b.htm">Theiner</a>) a letter from <a href="../cathen/08429c.htm">Pope John XXI</a> (1276) authorizing him to collect the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders'</a> tax for the recovery of the Holy Land. This John, one of the few <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> ever appointed to an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> see, was a great benefactor to his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, and he is believed to have erected the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and other carvings which decorate the western end of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. This can hardly be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, so far as the Romanesque doorway is concerned, for the Romanesque had then gone out for at least half a century as a feature in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> architecture, and given place to the pointed style. It is said that he governed Clonfert for no less than 30 years, and was then transferred by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, about 1296. It is doubtless <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that John, with his artistic Italian tastes, finding in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the best type of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Romanesque, probably a hundred years old, did much to renovate and decorate with statuary the beautiful building. This no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> would explain the ancient tradition that connects his name with the glories of the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. It is interesting to note in conclusion that Concors, an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clonfert, was one of the three plenipotentaries who were sent by Roderick O'Connor, the last King of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, to conclude the Treaty of Windsor, in the year 1175, by which Roderick renounced forever the sceptre and Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The city of <a href="../cathen/02758c.htm">St. Brendan</a> is now a vast solitude. The episcopal palace is falling into ruins; the beautiful church is there, but there is no resident <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, and only two houses &#151; that of the <a href="../cathen/13748a.htm">sexton</a> and the police barrack.
