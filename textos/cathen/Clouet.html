<h1>Clouet</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> name of several generations of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>.
<h2>Jean (Jean the Younger)</h2>

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1485; died, probably at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, between 1541 and 1545. He was the son and pupil of Jean the Elder, a <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> who went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> from <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1460 and afterwards settled at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> made the son court <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and, in 1518, a valet de chambre, a post of distinction. The court called him familiarly "Janet", a name which became generic, comprising his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, his son Fran&ccedil;ois, and their numerous imitators. <a href="../cathen/13180b.htm">Ronsard</a> sang:

<blockquote><p>Peins moy, Janet, peins moy je t'en supplie.</p></blockquote>

<p>His numerous portraits of royalty and nobility are all in the antique, or Gothic, style, like that of the <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Van Eycks</a>. His outlines are sharp and precise, all the lines are clear, and he gives great attention to details. Clouet <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> his sitter with fidelity and avoided theatrical (Italian) effects, hence the result is a portrait, simple, reticent, and naive. Much of his work was until recently attributed to <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbein</a>. In 1524 he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the celebrated portrait of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> in full armour on horseback, and in 1528 another, a life-size bust (now at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>), long ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06663b.htm">Mabuse</a>. Some authorities claim that of his many pictures only one is authentic: the portrait of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> in the Louvre. Other notable works of Clouet's are "Eleanor of Spain" (wife of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>) in Hampton Court, and "Margaret of Valois" in Liverpool.
<h2>Fran&ccedil;ois, called Fran&ccedil;ois Janet and Maitre Jehannet</h2>

<p>Born probably at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, between 1500 and 1520; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, between 1570 and 1580. He was the son and pupil of Jean the Younger and was naturalized in 1541. At the age of thirty-five he succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> as court <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> to <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, to whom he was also appointed a valet de chambre. Fran&ccedil;ois was also court <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> to Charles IX, at the close of whose reign all traces of him disappear. Clouet's work in oil, while <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> in its scrupulous attention to details, is, however, distinctively French, and he carried to its highest the fame of "the Janets". He was the last of the French <em>primitifs</em>. His pictures are <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> solidly, in pale, delicate tones, and without chiaroscuro. Clouet's portraits are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, accurate, and devoid of sentimentality; they show forth the moral and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> qualities of each sitter; and they "have the charm of <em>intime</em> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>" (Blanc). Two portraits of great brilliancy and distinction are the "Francis II as a Child" (1547) now at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, and "Henry II" (1553) in the Louvre; but Berlin possesses what are, perhaps, his masterpieces: "Francis II" and the "Duc d'Anjou" (Henry III). Clouet's office required him to depict every great court function, and as late as 1709 such a group of pictures was in existence. He made many sketches in black and red chalk, showing perfect draughtsmanship and splendid modelling. Castle Howard contains eighty-eight such drawings, all in the manner of <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbein</a>. Clouet also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> miniatures; that of greatest historical interest is "Mary Queen of Scots" (Windsor Castle), which has never been out of royal possession since catalogued, in the time of Charles, as "by Jennet a French limner". It is probably the only authentic picture of the unhappy Mary. Clouet's work was highly valued during his lifetime, and he was a power at the courts of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, Henry II, Francis II, and Charles IX. The brilliant men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> about these monarchs felt that "the Janets" had elevated art and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Today their pictures are so highly prized that many forgeries are made of them. Besides those mentioned, other great canvases by Fran&ccedil;ois are "Elizabeth of Austria", "Charles IX", both in the Louvre, and four portraits in Stafford House (London). Collections of his drawings are in the Louvre, British Museum, and Albertina Museum (Vienna).
