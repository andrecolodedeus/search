<h1>Coelchu</h1>  

<p>Also COLGA, COLCU (Latin <em>Colcus</em>)

<p>A distinguished <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04065a.htm">School of Clonmacnoise</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, who flourished during the latter half of the eighth century. He had been a student of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and had devoted himself especially to the study of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, whom he looked upon as his special <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a>. Coelchu was remarkable for his learning, and was surnamed the Scribe, and also the Wise. <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a> (Acta Sanctorum Hiberni&aelig;) mentions one tract from the pen of Coelchu which was then extant, and which was entirely of a devotional character. He is generally assumed to be the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with whom <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> apparently had some correspondence. A letter of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> to him has been published by Ussher (Sylloge, Ep. xviii) and republished by <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a>. It is headed "Albini Magistri ad Colcum lectorem in Scotia. Benedicto magistro et pio patri Colcu Alcuinus humilis levita salutem". There can hardly be any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the Colcu spoken of was the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clonmacnoise, and that the writer of the letter was <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, not Albin the companion of Clement, though there is no reason for concluding from the style of the address that <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> had ever been a student of Coelchu's at <a href="../cathen/04065a.htm">Clonmacnoise</a>. In this letter <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> gives Coelchu an account of the state of religion on the Continent, mentions Joseph, one of Coelchu's pupils then in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, speaks of disputes between King Charles and <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa of Mercia</a>, on account of which he himself was likely to be sent as negotiator into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. This clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> that the letter was written shortly before 790. He sends Coelchu presents of money from King Charles and from himself for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/04065a.htm">Clonmacnoise</a> and for other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and asks their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for himself and the king. There is another reference to Coelchu in <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> letter to Joseph, mentioned already in the letter to Coelchu. Though Coelchu was spoken of as the Scribe or Doctor of all the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, none of his writings have come down to us.
