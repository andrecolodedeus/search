<h1>Cola di Rienzi</h1>  

<p>(i.e., NICOLA, son of Lorenzo)

<p>A popular tribune and extraordinary historical figure. His father was an innkeeper at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the vicinity of the Trastevere; though it was believed that he was really the son of the Emperor Henry VII. His childhood and youth were passed at <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, with some relatives to whom he was sent on the death of his mother. Though he was thus brought up in the country he succeeded in acquiring a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of letters and of Latin, and devoted himself to a study of the history of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the Latin authors, Livy, Valerius Maximus, Cicero, Seneca, <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, and the poets. When his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> died he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and practised as a notary. The sight of the remains of the former greatness of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> only increased his admiration for the city and the men described in his favourite authors. Contemplating the condition in which <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> then was in the absence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, torn by the factions of the nobles who plundered on all sides and shed innocent blood, he conceived a desire of restoring the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and splendour of former days. His plans became more definite and settled when his brother was slain in a brawl between the Orsini and the Colonna. Thenceforth he thought only of the means of breaking the power of the barons. To accomplish this he had first to win the favour of the populace by upholding the cause of the oppressed.

<p>In consequence of this and on account of the eloquence with which he spoke in Latin, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1343 to <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, by the captain of the people, to ask him to return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and grant the great jubilee every five years. Cola explained to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the miserable condition of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Clement was much impressed, and appointed him to the office of notary (secretary) of the Camera Capitolina, in which position he could gain a better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the misfortunes of the city. Cola then by his public discourses and private conversations prepared the people; a conspiracy was formed, and on 19 May, 1347, he summoned the populace to assemble the following day in the Campidoglio. There Cola explained his plans and read a new democratic constitution which, among other things, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> the establishment of a civic militia. The people conferred absolute power on him; but Cola at first contented himself with the title of tribune of the people; later, however, he assumed the bombastic titles of <em>Candidatus Spiritus Sancti, Imperator Orbis, Zelator Itali&aelig;, Amator Orbis et Tribunus Augustus</em> (candidate of the Holy Spirit, emperor of the world, lover of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, of the world, august tribune). He was wise enough to select a colleague, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> vicar, Raymond, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>. The success of the new regime was wonderful. The most powerful barons had to leave the city; the others <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> fealty to the popular government. An era of peace and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> seemed to have come. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, on learning what had happened, regretted that he had not been consulted, but gave Cola the title and office of Rector, to be exercised in conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>. His name was heard everywhere, princes had recourse to him in their disputes, the sultan fortified his ports.

<p>Cola then thought of reestablishing the liberty and independence of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, by restoring the Roman Empire with an Italian emperor. In August, 1347, two hundred deputies of the Italian cities assembled at his request. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was declared free, and all those who had arrogated a lordship to themselves were declared fallen from power; the right of the people to elect the emperor was asserted. Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> and Charles of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> were called upon to justify their usurpation of the imperial title. Cola flattered himself secretly with the hope of becoming emperor; but his high opinion of himself <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his ruin. He was a dreamer rather than a man of action; he lacked many qualities for the exercise of good government, especially foresight and the elements of political <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. He had formed a most puerile concept of the empire. He surrounded himself with <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> luxury, to pay for which he had to impose new taxes; thereupon the enthusiasm of the people, weary of serving a theatrical emperor, vanished. The barons perceived this, and forgetting for the moment their mutual discord, joined together against their common enemy. In vain the bell summoned the people to arms in the Campidoglio. No one stirred. Cola had driven out the barons, but he had not thought of reducing them to inaction; on the contrary he had rendered them more hostile by his many foolish and humiliating acts. Lacking all military <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he could offer no serious resistance to their attacks. The discontent of the people increased; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, the other Rector of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who had already protested against what had occurred at the convention of the Italian deputies, abandoned the city; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> repudiated Cola in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Thus deserted, and not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> himself safe, he took refuge in the Castle of S. Angelo, and three days later (18 Dec., 1347) the barons returned in triumph to restore things to their former condition.

<p>Cola fortunately succeeded in escaping. He sought refuge with the Spiritual <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> living in the hermitages of Monte Maiella. But the plague of 1348, the presence of bands of adventurers and the jubilee of 1350 had increased the <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> of the people and still more of the Spirituals. One of the latter, Fra Angelo, told Rienzi that it was now the proper moment to think of the common weal, to co-operate in the restoration of the empire and in the purification of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: all of which had been predicted by <a href="../cathen/08406c.htm">Joachim of Flora</a>, the celebrated Calabrian <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and that he ought to give his assistance. Cola betook himself thence to Charles IV at Prague (1350), who <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> him, either as a madman or as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. After two years Cola was sent at the request of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where through the intercession of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, his admirer, though now disillusioned, he was treated better. When <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> sent Cardinal Albornoz into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (at the beginning of 1353) he allowed Cola di Rienzi to accompany him. The Romans, who had fallen back into their former state of <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, invited him to return, and Albornoz consented to appoint him senator (<em>sindaco</em>) of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 1 Aug., 1354, Rienzi entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in triumph. But the new government did not last long. His luxury and revelry, followed by the inevitable taxation, above all the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> killing of several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (among whom was Fra Moriale, a brigand, in the service of Cola), provoked the people to fury. On 8 Oct., 1354, the cry of "Death to Rienzi the traitor!" rose in the city. Cola attempted to flee, but was recognized and slain, and his corpse dragged through the streets of the city. Cola represented, one might say, the death agony of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> (papal-national-democratic) <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and the rise of the classical (imperial and &aelig;sthetic) <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>.
