<h1>Collections of Ancient Canons</h1>  

<p>While the essential principles of the constitution and government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were immutably fixed by her Divine Founder, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation, emanating as it does from the authority established by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, has shared all the vicissitudes of the latter. This means that it was not a finished product from the beginning, but rather a gradual growth, each phase of which was dictated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> wisdom of the time. This is especially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the earlier <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> centuries, when as yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> lived largely on tradition and custom, and when such written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as existed were not originally universal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> but local or provincial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, to which later a broader <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> was added through the express or tacit <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the legitimate authority. Hence arose the necessity of collecting, or in a way codifying, such legislation.
<h2>Classification</h2>

<p>These ancient collections may be classified either according to their <em>historical authority</em> or according to the <em>method of the compiler</em>.
<h3>Authority</h3>

<p>If we consider only their historical authority these collections are genuine (e.g. the "Versio Hispanica"), or <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, i.e. made with the help of documents forged, interpolated, wrongly attributed, or otherwise defective (e.g. the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore collection</a>). If we consider their juridical authority they are official, authentic, i.e. <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by competent authority, or private, the work of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and owning no value other than their intrinsic worth or that derived from habitual usage.
<h3>Method</h3>

<p>If we consider the method of the compiler, these collections are chronological, in case their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are classified according to the time of <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, or systematic (logical, methodical), if the collection follow a rational order. Naturally, in the earlier centuries the collections are brief and contain few <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> chronologically certain. Only with the increase of legislation did a methodical classification become <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, or at least the addition of methodical tables (see below, African and Spanish collections).

<p>In this article we shall describe the ancient collections of canons; <ul><li>(1) From the earliest Christian times to the period of the apocryphal collections (middle of the ninth century); <li>(2) From the end of the ninth century to the Decretum of Gratian (1139-50).</ul>

<p>The forged collections of the middle of the ninth century will be treated in the article, <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">FALSE DECRETALS</a>. Much of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these matters is owing to the historical researches begun at the end of the sixteenth century, whence issued the critical editions of the Fathers, the councils, and the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a>. We are particularly indebted, however, to two works of primary importance: <ul><li>(1) the dissertation (P.L., LVI) of the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini brothers</a> of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> (eighteenth century) "Concerning the ancient collection and collectors of Canons as far as Gratian" &mdash; a study quite unique for its erudition and critical acumen; <li>(2) the history of the sources and literature of canon law by <a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Frederic Maassen</a> (Geschichte der Quellen und Literatur des Canonischen Rechts, Gratz, 1870, vol. I), in which the learned professor of Gratz took up this subject where the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a> had left it, but with a far richer supply of documents. Unfortunately he stops at <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore</a>.</ul>
<h2>From the earliest times to the apocryphal collections</h2>
<h3>Collections of the apostolic Period</h3>

<p>The Apostles certainly issued disciplinary regulations, either as inspired authors (Divine Apostolic law, pertaining to the immutable deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>), or simply as <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation (human Apostolic law). In the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ages there were current divers collections attributed to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. These collections were <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, although there may be in it some regulations of really Apostolic origin. It is all very interesting, partly because of the vestiges it offers of the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, and partly because, <em>de facto</em>, many of these regulations were long considered truly Apostolic and, as such, influenced seriously the formation of ecclesiastical law. The most important of these collections are the Doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>, the Apostolic Constitutions, and the <a href="../cathen/03279a.htm">Apostolic Canons</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03279a.htm">APOSTOLIC CANONS</a>). The Apostolic Constitutions, though originally accepted throughout the Orient, were declared <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan (Quinisext) Council of 692</a>; they were never accepted as ecclesiastical law in the West. The <a href="../cathen/03279a.htm">Apostolic Canons</a> (eighty-five) were, on the other hand, approved by the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan Council</a>. Dionysius Exignus, a Western canonist of the first half of the sixth century, noted that "many accept with difficulty the so-called canons of the Apostles". Nevertheless he admitted into his collection the first fifty of these canons. The so-called Decretum Gelasianum, <em>de libris non recipiendis</em> (about the sixth century), puts them among the apocrypha. From the collection of <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a> they passed into divers Western collections, though their authority was never on one level. We find them admitted at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the ninth century in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> decisions; in the eleventh century Cardinal Humbert accepts only the first fifty (Adversus Simoniacos, I, 8, and Contra Nic&aelig;tam, 16 P.L., CXLIII). Only two of them (20, 29) found their way into the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gregory IX.
<h3>Papal decretals</h3>

<p>In primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> centuries the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> carried on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government by means of an active and extensive correspondence. We learn from a synod of the year 370, under Pope Damasus, that the minutes of their letters or <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> were kept in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> archives. These archives (see VATICAN ARCHIVES) have perished up to the time of <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> (died 882). In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries attempts were made to reconstruct them; the most successful is that of Jaff&eacute; ("Regesta RR. Pont.", 2nd ed., 1885; cf. the important revision of Jaff&eacute; by P. Kehr, "Italia Pontificia", <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1906 sqq.). During the period under discussion (i.e. to the middle of the eleventh century) we shall note a constant use of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> by the compilers of canonical collections from the sixth century on.


<h3>Greek collections</h3>

<ul><li>(1) In 451 there was quoted at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> a collection of councils no longer extant, nor has the name of the compiler ever transpired. It seems to have been based on the canons of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> (314) and Neo-C&aelig;sarea (314-25), to which were added later those of <a href="../cathen/06377b.htm">Gangra</a> (36-70). At the beginning of the collection were then placed the decrees of Nic&aelig;a (325); subsequently the canons of Antioch (341) were included, in which shape it was known to the Fathers of Chalcedon. In the latter part of the fifth century the canons of Laodic&aelig;a (343-81), Constantinople (381), Ephesus (431), and Chalcedon (451), were incorporated with this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> code, and finally (after the canons of Neo-C&aelig;sarea) the decrees of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> (343-44), in which form the collection was in use during the sixth century. Though unofficial in character, it represents (inclusive of sixty-eight canons taken from the "Canonical Epistles" of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, I, III) the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> discipline of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> between 500 and 600. <li>(2) This collection was chronological in order. Towards 535 an unknown compiler classified its materials in a methodical way under sixty titles, and added to the canons twenty-one imperial constitutions relative to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters taken from the Code of Justinian. This collection has been lost. <li>(3) Some years later (540-550) Johannes Scholasticus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, made use of this code to compile a new methodical collection, which he divided into fifty books. It is printed in the second volume of Voel and Justel, "Bibliotheca Juris Canonici veteris" (Paris, 1661). After the emperor's death (565), the patriarch extracted from ten of the former's constitutions, known as "Novell&aelig;", some eighty-seven chapters and added them to the aforesaid collection. <li>(4) In this way arose the mixed collections known as Nomocanons (Gk. <em>nomoi</em>, "laws", <em>kanones</em>, "canons"), containing not only ecclesiastical laws but also imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> pertaining to the same matters. The first of these was published under Emperor Maurice (582-602); under each title were given, after the canons, the corresponding civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. This collection (wrongly attributed to the afore-mentioned patriarch) is also found in the second volume of Voel and Justel (op. cit.). <li>(5) The <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Quinisext Council</a> (692) of Constantinople, called Trullan from the hall of the palace (<em>in trullo</em>) where it was held, issued 102 disciplinary canons; it included also the canons of the former councils and certain patristic regulations, all of which it considered constitutive elements of the ecclesiastical law of the East. This collection contains, therefore, an official enumeration of the canons which then governed the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, but no official <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of a given collection or particular text of these canons. It is to be noted that the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> never fully approved this council. In 787 a similar recapitulation of the ancient canons was made by the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>.</ul>
<h3>Italo-Latin collections</h3>

<h4 id="i">Latin version of the canons of Nic&aelig;a and Sardica</h4>

<p>The former council (325) was always held in the highest repute throughout the West, where its canons were in vigour together with those of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>, the complement of the anti-Arian legislation of Nic&aelig;a, and whose decrees had been drawn up originally in both Latin and Greek. The canons of the two councils were numbered in running order, as though they were the work of but one council (a trait met with in divers Latin collections), which explains why the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> is sometimes called &oelig;cumenical by earlier writers, and its canons attributed to the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>. For the text of the version as found in the various collections see <a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, op. cit., p. 8 sqq. The oldest versions of these canons quoted in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> are no longer extant.

<h4 id="ii">The "Hispana" or "Isidoriana" version</h4>

<p>Towards the middle of the fifth century, perhaps earlier, there appeared a Latin version of the afore-said canons of Nic&aelig;a, <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, Neo-C&aelig;sarea, and Gangra, to which were added a little later those of Antioch, Laodic&aelig;a, and Constantinople; the canons of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> were inserted about the same time after those of <a href="../cathen/06377b.htm">Gangra</a>. <a href="../cathen/16010a.htm">Bickell</a> considers it possible that this version was made in Northern Africa, while Walter inclines to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; it is now generally believed that the version was made in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. It was long believed, however, that it came from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, hence the name of "Hispana" or "Isidoriana", the latter term derived from its insertion in the collection attributed to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a> (see below, <em>Spanish Collections</em>), in which it was edited, of course according to the text followed by the Spanish compiler.

<h4 id="iii">"Prisca" or "Itala" version</h4>

<p>This, too, seems to have grown up gradually in the course of the fifth century, and in its present shape exhibits the afore-mentioned canons of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, Neo-C&aelig;sarea, Nic&aelig;a, <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>, <a href="../cathen/06377b.htm">Gangra</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, and Constantinople. It came to be known as "Itala" from the place of its origin, and as "Prisca" because of an overhasty conclusion that <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a> referred to it in the preface of his first collection when he wrote: "Laurentius offended by the confusion that reigned in the ancient version [<em>prisc&oelig; versionis</em>]." It was edited by Voel and Justel in the first volume of their above-quoted "Bibliotheca juris canonici veteris"; a better text is that of the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini brothers</a> in the third volume of their edition of the works of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> (P.L., LVI, 746).

<h4 id="iv">Collection of Dionysius Exiguus</h4>

<p>The collections we have now to describe were justified and called for by the increasing canonical material of the Latin West in the course of the fifth century. It may be said at once that they were far from satisfactory. Towards 500 a Scythian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, known as <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>, who had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after the death of Pope Gelasius (496), and who was well skilled in both Latin and Greek, undertook to bring out a more exact translation of the canons of the Greek councils. In a second effort he collected <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> from Siricius (384-89) to Anastasius II (496-98), inclusive, anterior therefore, to Pope Symmachus (514-23). By order of Pope Hormisdas (514-23), Dionysius made a third collection, in which he included the original text of all the canons of the Greek councils, together with a Latin version of the same. Of this collection the preface alone has survived. Finally, he combined the first and second in one collection, which thus united the canons of the councils and the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a>; it is in this shape that the work of Dionysius has reached us. This collection opens with a table or list of titles, each of which is afterwards repeated before the respective canons; then come the first fifty canons of the Apostles, the canons of the Greek councils, the canons of Carthage (419), and the canons of preceding African <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> under Aurelius, which had been read and inserted in the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>. This first part of the collection is closed by a letter of <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Pope Boniface I</a>, read at the same council, letters of <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a> and Atticus of Constantinople to the African Fathers, and a letter of <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Pope Celestine I</a>. The second part of the collection opens likewise with a preface, in the shape of a letter to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Julian, and a table of titles; then follow one <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a> of Siricius, twenty-one of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a>, one of Zozimus, four of <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Boniface I</a>, three of <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Celestine I</a>, seven of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>, one of Gelasius I, and one of Anastasius II. The additions met with in Voel and Justel (op. cit.) are taken from inferior <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.

<p>There were gaps in the work of Dionysius; he seems, in particular, to have taken the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a>, not from the archives of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, but from previous compilations, hence certain omissions, which need not arouse any suspicion of the authenticity of documents not quotes. In spite of its defects this collection far surpassed all previous efforts of the kind, not alone by its good order, but also by the clear, intelligible text of its version, and by the importance of its documents. Very soon it superseded all earlier collections and was much used (<em>celeberimo usu</em>), especially in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, says <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>. It became popular in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Africa and even before <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> had found its way into Gaul and Britain. It was the medium by which the African canons reached the East. Copyists used it to correct the text of the other collections, a fact not to be lost sight of at the risk of taking an interdependence of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> for an interdependence of collections. Despite its authority of daily use and its occasional service in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery, it never had a truly official character; it even seems that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were wont to quote their own <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal letters</a> not from Dionysius, but directly from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> registers. In time the "Collectio Dionysiana", as it came to be known, was enlarged and some of these additions entered the "Collectio Hadriana", which <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> sent (774) to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and which was received by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the empire at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aix-la-Chapelle</a> (Aachen) in 802. It is none other than the "Collectio Dionysiana", with some additions in each of its two parts. In this shape it acquired and kept the title of "Codex Canonum". Neither the action of Pope Adrian nor the acceptance by the Synod of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aix-la-Chapelle</a> conferred on the book an official character, or made it a code of universally <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; with much greater reason may it be said that it did not thereby become an exclusively authoritative code of ecclesiastical law. It was first printed in the first volume of Voel and Justel (op. cit.), re-edited by Lepelletier (Paris, 1687), and reprinted in P.L., LXVII. A new and more satisfactory edition is that of Cuthbert Hamilton Turner, in "Ecclesi&aelig; Occidentalis Monumenta Juris Antiquissima" (Oxford, 1899- 1908), vol. II, fasc. II.

<h4 id="v">The "Avellana" collection</h4>

<p>The Avellana Collection, so-called because its oldest known <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> was bought for the abbey of Santa Croce Avellana by <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> (died 1073). The collection probably dates from the middle of the sixth century. It follows neither chronological nor <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> order, and seems to have grown to its present shape according as the compiler met with the materials that he has transmitted to us. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a> pronounce it a very valuable collection because of the great number of early canonical documents (nearly 200) that are found in no other collection. All its texts are authentic, save eight letters from divers <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to Peter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. The "Avellana" has never been edited as such, though all its documents have passed into the great works of <a href="../cathen/14027c.htm">Sirmond</a>, <a href="../cathen/04454a.htm">Coustant</a>, <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, and Foggini, with the exception of two letters whose text is given by the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a>, in whose work, quoted above, are also indicated the places where the various texts of the "Avellana" may be read.

<h4 id="vi">Various other collections</h4>

<p>Despite the exceptional popularity of <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>, which caused the previous compilations to be disused and soon forgotten, several of them were preserved, as also were some other contemporary collections &mdash; among them several that still offer a certain interest. See the above-quoted dissertation of the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a>, II, iv, and <a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a> (op. cit., 476, 526, 721). It will suffice to mention the collection known as the "Chieti" or "Vaticana Regin&aelig;", through which a very old and distinct version of the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> has reached us. It has been edited by the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a> (P.L., LVI, 818).
<h3>Collection of the African Church</h3>

<h4 id="i">Canons of the African councils</h4>

<p>From the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> Northern Africa received only the decrees of Nic&aelig;a (325), which it owed to C&aelig;cilianus of Carthage, one of the Nicene Fathers. The African Church created its domestic code of discipline in its own councils. It was customary to read and confirm in each council the canons of preceding councils, in which way there grew up collections of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees, but purely local in authority. Their moral authority, however, was great, and from the Latin collections they eventually made their way into the Greek collections. The best-known are: <ul><li>(a) the Canons of the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (Aug., 397) which confirmed the "Breviarium" of the canons of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> (393), one of the chief sources of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>; <li>(b) the Canons of the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (419), at which were present 217 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and among whose decrees were inserted 105 canons of previous councils.</ul>

<h4 id="ii">"Statuta Ecclesi&aelig; Antiqua"</h4>

<p>In the second part of the "Hispana" (see below) and in other collections are found, together with other <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">African councils</a>, 104 canons which the compiler of the "Hispana" attributes to a Pseudo-Fourth <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> of 398. These canons are often known as "Statuta Ecclesi&aelig; Antiqua", and in some <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are entitled "Statuta antiqua Orientis". Hefele maintains that in spite of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> attribution, these canons are authentic, or at least summaries of authentic canons of ancient <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">African councils</a>, and collected in their present shape before the end of the sixth century. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, Mgr. Duchesne, and Abb&eacute; Malnory believe them a compilation made at Arles in the first part of the sixth century; Malnory specifies St. C&aelig;sarius of Arles (q.v.) as their author.

<h4 id="iii">The "Breviatio Canonum" of Fulgentius Ferrandus</h4>

<p>It is a methodical collection and under its seven titles disposes 230 abridged canons of Greek ("Hispana" text) and <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">African councils</a>. It was compiled towards 546 by Fulgentius, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Carthage and a disciple of <a href="../cathen/06315a.htm">St. Fulgentius</a> of <a href="../cathen/13230c.htm">Ruspe</a>; the text is in P.L., LXVII.

<h4 id="iv">The "Concordia" of Cresconius</h4>

<p><a href="../cathen/04486a.htm">This writer</a>, apparently an African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, compiled his collection about 690. It is based on that of <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>; only, in place of reproducing in full each canon, it cuts it up to suit the demands of the titles used; hence its name of "Concordia". Between the preface and the text of the collection the writer inserted a resume of his work. This took on the name of "Breviatio Canonum" which led some to imagine that the latter title implied a work other than the "Concordia", whereas it meant only a part or rather the preamble of the latter, whose text is in P.L., LXXXVIII.
<h3>Collections of the Spanish Church</h3>

<p>Under this heading the historian of canon law generally understands the collections that arose in the lands once under <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> rule &mdash; <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and Southern Gaul. In this territory councils were very frequent, especially after the conversion of King Reccared (587), and they paid much attention to <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. Naturally the need of canonical collections was soon felt. As a rule, such collections contain, besides the decrees of Spanish <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, the canons also of Nic&aelig;a and Sardica (accepted in the Spanish Church from the beginning), those of the Greek councils known through the "Itala", and those of the Gallican and African Councils, quite influential in the formation of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. Three of these collections are important: &mdash;

<h4 id="i">The "Capitula Martini"</h4>

<p>It is divided into two parts, one dealing with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the other relative to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>; in both the author classifies methodically the canons of the councils in eighty-four chapters. He says himself in the preface that he does not pretend to reproduce the text literally, but with set purpose breaks up, abridges, or glosses the same, in order to make it more intelligible to "simple people"; possibly he has occasionally modified it to suit the Spanish discipline of his time. Though much has been borrowed from Latin, Gallican, and African Councils, it is the Greek Councils that furnish the greater part of the canons. The "Capitula" were read and approved at the Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (572). Some writers, misled by the name, attributed them to <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Pope Martin I</a>; they are in reality the work of Martin of Pannonia, better known as <a href="../cathen/09731b.htm">Martin of Braga</a>, of which place he was <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in the sixth century. Their text was incorporated with the "Isidoriana", from which they were taken and edited apart by Merlin and by Gaspar Loaisa, and in the first volume of the oft-quoted work by Voel and Justel, after collation of the variants in the best <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.

<h4 id="ii">The Spanish "Epitome"</h4>

<p>The Epitome is the name of the collection edited by the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a> (op. cit., III, IV) from two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (Verona and Lucca). It has two parts: one includes the canons of Greek, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a>, Gallican, and Spanish councils; the other divers <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> from Siricius to Vigilius (384-555), with two <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> texts of St. Clement and an extract from <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. The compiler designedly abridged his texts, and mentions only three sources, a Braga collection (the "Capitula Martini", his first chapter being a resume of that work), an Alcal&aacute; (Complutum) collection, and one of Cabra (Agrabensis). Though characterized by lack of order and exactness, the "Epitome" interests us because of the antiquity of its sources. <a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a> thinks it connected with the "Codex Canonum", the nucleus of the group of collections whence eventually issued the "Hispana", and of which we shall treat apropos of the latter.

<h4 id="iii">The "Hispana" or "Isidoriana"</h4>

<p>This collection must not be confounded with the above-described "Versio Hispanica" or "Isidoriana", among the earlier Latin collections, and which contained only canons of Greek councils. The collection in question, like that of <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a> on which it is based, contains two parts: the first includes canons of Greek, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a>, Gallican, and Spanish councils, with some letters of <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> and Atticus of Constantinople, while the second has the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> as found in Dionysius, together with some others, most of the latter addressed to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This is the chronological "Hispana". Somewhat later, towards the end of the seventh century, it was recast in <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> order, by some unknown writer, and divided into ten books, which were again subdivided into titles and chapters. This is the methodical "Hispana". Finally, the copyists were wont to place at the beginning of the chronological "Hispana" a table of contents of the methodical collection, but with references to the text of the chronological: in this shape it was known as the "Excerpta Canonum". The chronological "Hispana" seems to have been originally the "Codex Canonum" mentioned at the Fourth Council of Toledo (633), with later additions. In the ninth century it was attributed, with insufficient evidence, to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a>. In spite of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> attribution, the "Hispana" contains very few documents of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity. Later on, additions were made to it, the latest being taken from the seventeenth council of Toledo (694). In this enlarged form, i.e. the "Codex Canonum", the "Hispana" was approved by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> as authentic (<a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, Ep. 121, to Peter, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Compostella). Until the thirteenth century, its authority was great in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore</a> (see below) made a generous use of its materials. (See the text in P.L., LXXXXIV, reprinted from the edition of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1808-21, executed at the Royal Printing House).
<h3>Gallican collections</h3>

<h4 id="i">The "Collectio Quesneliana"</h4>

<p>The close relations of the churches of Gaul with those of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> familiarized the former at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> with the canonical collections of the latter churches, to which were added the canons of their own Gallican <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. At the beginning of the sixth century there arose in Gaul an extensive collection, based apparently on the "Antiqua Isidoriana", the "Prisca", the "Chieti" collection (see above), and the African collections, and which, besides the earliest Eastern and the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">African councils</a>, includes <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a>, letters of Gallican <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and other documents. It is of Gallican origin, though it includes no councils of Gaul. Its name is derived from the Oratorian, P. <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, its first editor, who wrongly entitled it "Codex Canonum ecclesi&aelig; Roman&aelig;", and tried to prove that it was an official collection of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. It cannot, therefore, serve as authentic confirmation of the usages of that Church or of the churches of Africa. The <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a> reprinted it in the third volume of their edition of the works of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo I</a>, with excellent dissertations against <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> (P.L., LVI). During the sixth and succeeding centuries the canonical compilers kept at their task; they received the African canons, those of Gallican councils, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> and letters of national <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Some of these collections were chronological, others methodical (see the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a>, II, x and <a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, op. cit., 556, 821). We have already called attention to the importance (after 802) of the "Collectio Dionysio-Hadriana".

<h4 id="ii">The "Codex Carolinus"</h4>

<p>A collection of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> addressed to <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, Pepin, and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, compiled by the latter's order in 791 (P.L., XCVIII), not to be confounded with the "Libri Carolini" (see <a href="../cathen/03371b.htm">CAROLINE BOOKS</a>) in which were set forth for <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a> various <em>dubia</em> concerning the veneration of images.
<h3>English and Irish collections</h3>

<p>Before the seventh century we meet with no collections of canons particular to the English and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Churches. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> is at this time based on the provincial councils, which draw their inspiration from the <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>, and are reinforced by the ordinances of the Anglo-Saxon kings. Roman collections appear in 678 when <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a> is quoted at the Council of Herford. Thenceforth appear various collections of local origin, e.g. the "De Jure Sacerdotali" (P.L., LXVIII) and the "Exceptiones" attributed (but without sufficient reason) to <a href="../cathen/05326a.htm">Egbert of York</a> (died 767). The most celebrated of these collections is the "Synodus Patritii" or "Collectio Hibernensis", of the early part of the eighth century, whose compiler put together previous <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation in sixty-four to sixty-nine chapters, preceded by extracts from the "Etymologi&aelig;" of St. Isidore concerning synodal regulations. The preface states that for the sake of brevity and clearness, and to reconcile certain juridical antinomies, effort is made to render the sense of the canons rather than their letter. It is a methodical collection to the extent that the matters treated are placed in their respective chapters, but there is much confusion in the distribution of the latter. In spite of its defects this collection made its way into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and until the twelfth century influenced the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation of churches in both countries (Paul Fournier, De l'influence de la collection irlandaise sur les collections canoniques).
<h3>Particular collections</h3>

<p>Apart from the above-described general collections there are some special or particular collections that deserve brief mention. <ul><li>(1) Some of them deal with a particular <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, e.g. the collections of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, those of Notre Dame, of Rustiens, the Novaro-Vaticana, and the "Codex Encyclius" relative to <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, the "Veronensis" and the "Virdunensis" in the affair of Acacius. <li>(2) Others contain the documents and juridical texts that concern an individual church or country, e.g. the collection of Arles, in which were gathered the privileges of that Church, the collections of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, Saint-Amand, F&eacute;camp, etc., in which were brought together the canons of the councils of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <li>(3) In the same category may be placed the <em>capitula</em> or episcopal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, i.e. decisions and regulations collected from Various quarters by local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the use and direction of their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (see CAPITULARIES), e.g. the "Capitula" of Theodulf of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, end of the eighth century (P.L., CV), of <a href="../cathen/07115a.htm">Hatto of Basle</a> (882, in Mon. Germ. Hist: Leges, 1, 439-41), of Boniface of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (745, in D'Ach&eacute;ry, Spicilegium, ed. nova I, 597). Still other collections deal with some special point of discipline. Such are the ancient <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> collections called by the Greeks "Euchologia" (q.v.) and by the Latins "Libri mysteriorum", or "sacramentorum", more usually "Sacramentaries" (q.v.), also since the eighth century the "Ordines Romani" (q.v.) found in P.L., LXXVIII. Here, too, belong the collections of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> formul&aelig; (see <a href="../cathen/06141a.htm">BOOKS OF FORMULARIES</a>), especially the <a href="../cathen/09215c.htm">"Liber Diurnus"</a> of the Roman Chancery, compiled probably between 685 and 782 (P.L., CV, 11), edited by Garnier (Paris, 1680) and anew by M. de Rozi&egrave;res (Paris, 1869), and by Th. Sickel (Vienna, 1889). Special mention is due to the "Penitentials" (Libri P&oelig;nitentiales), collections of penitential canons, councils, and catalogues of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sanctions, to which were gradually added rules for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. This important subject will be treated more fully under the article PENITENTIAL BOOKS.</ul>
<h3>Collections of ecclesiastico-civil laws</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, as such, has no standing in the canonical forum. Yet in the first centuries of her existence the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> often rounded out her own legislation by adopting certain provisions of the secular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Moreover, either by mutual agreement, as under the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> kings, or by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power's</a> usurpation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> domain, as frequently happened under the Byzantine emperors, the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> legislated on matters in themselves purely canonical; such <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> it behooved an ecclesiastic to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> often needs some acquaintance with the pertinent <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> in order to decide properly even in purely secular matters that are occasionally submitted to him. Hence the utility of collections of civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters or the administration of the canonical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> (<em>praxis canonica</em>). We have already noted in the East the collections known as "Nomocanones"; the West also had mixed collections of the same nature.

<h4 id="i">Collections of Roman Law</h4>

<p>This law interested quite particularly the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of the barbarian kingdoms that rose on the ruins of the Western Empire, since they continued to live by it (<em>Ecclesia vivit lege romana</em>); moreover, apart from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Anglo-Saxons, the legislation of all the barbarian peoples of Gaul, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was profoundly Influenced by the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>. (a) The "Lex romana canonice compta", apparently compiled in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> during the ninth century, and handed down in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It includes portions of the "Institutiones" of the "Codex" of Justinian, and of the "Epitome" of Julian.

<h4 id="ii">Capitularies of the Frankish kings</h4>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the latter were very favourable to religious interests; not a few of them were the result of the mutual deliberations of both the civil and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> power. Hence the exceptional authority of the royal capitularies (q.v.) before <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunals. In the first half of the ninth century Ansegisus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fontenelles (823-33), collected in four books capitularies of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, Louis the Pious, and Lothaire; the first two books contain provisions concerning the "ecclesiastical order", the latter two exhibit the "law of the world". Ansegisus himself added three appendixes. His work was widely used in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and was quoted in diets and councils as an authentic collection.

<p>This rapid sketch exhibits the vitality of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the earliest centuries, and her constant activity for the preservation of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. During this long elaboration the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> unifies her legislation, but accepts little from beyond her own boundaries. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, with perhaps the sole exception of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, makes progress in the development of local discipline and exhibits an anxiety to harmonize particular legislation with the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, the canons of <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>, and the special legislation of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Doubtless in the above-described collection of canons, the result of this long disciplinary development, we meet with forged decrees of councils and <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, even with forged collections, e.g. the collections of pseudo-Apostolic legislation. Nevertheless the influence of these <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> works on other canonical collections was restricted. The latter were, almost universally, made up of authentic documents. Canonical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in the future would have been nourished exclusively from legitimate sources had not a larger number of forged documents appeared about the middle of the ninth century (Capitula of Benedict Levita, Capitula Angilramni, Canons of Isaac of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, above all the collection of Pseudo-Isidore. See <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">FALSE DECRETALS</a>). But <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vigilance did not cease; in the West especially, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> kept up an energetic protest against the decay of her discipline; witness the many councils, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and mixed assemblies of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and civil officials, also the numerous (over forty) new canonical collections from the ninth to the beginning of the twelfth century and whose methodical order foreshadows the great juridical syntheses of later centuries. Being compiled, however, for the most part not directly from the original canonical sources, but from immediately preceding collections, which in turn often depend on <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> productions of the ninth century, they appear tainted to the extent in which they make use of these forgeries. Such taint, however, affects the critical value of these collections rather than the legitimacy of the legislation which they exhibit. While the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">"False Decretals"</a> affected certainly <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, it is now generally recognized that they did not introduce any essential or constitutional modifications. They gave a more explicit formulation to certain principles of the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or brought more frequently into practice certain rules hitherto less recognized in daily use. As to the substance of this long development of disciplinary legislation, we may recognize with Paul Fournier a double current. The German collections, while not failing to admit the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy, are seemingly concerned with the adaptation of the canons to actual needs of time and place; this is particularly visible in the collection of <a href="../cathen/03064a.htm">Burchard of Worms</a>. The Italian collections, on the other hand, insist more on the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy, and in general of the spiritual power. M. Fournier indicates, as especially influential in this sense, the Collection in Seventy-four Titles. Both tendencies meet and unite in the works of <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Yvo of Chartres</a>. The compilations of this epoch may, therefore, be classed in these two broad categories. We do not, however, insist too strongly on these views, as yet somewhat provisory, and proceed to describe the principal collections of the next period, following, as a rule, the chronological order.
<h2>End of the ninth century to Gratian (1139-50)</h2>

<p>In these two centuries the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> were quite active in their efforts to withstand the decay of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> discipline; the evidence of this is seen in the frequency of councils, mixed assemblies of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and imperial officials, and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> whose decrees (capitularies) were often published by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In this period many new collections of canons were made, some forty of which, as already said, are known to us.
<h3>The "Collectio Anselmo Dedicata"</h3>

<p>Though as yet unedited, this collection is generally accounted quite valuable by reason of its abundance of materials and its good order; it was also one of the most widely used. Its twelve books treat the following subjects: <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, judgments, <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a>, spiritual things (rules of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>), and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Its sources are the "Dionysiana", the "Hispana", the correspondence (<em>Registrum</em>) of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a>, and various collections of civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Unfortunately it has also drawn on <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore</a>. It is dedicated to Anselm, doubtless Anselm II of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (833-97), and is now held to have been compiled in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> towards the end of the ninth century. It is certainly anterior to Burchard (1012-23), whose work depends on this collection. The author is unknown.
<h3>The "Collection of Regino of Pr&uuml;m"</h3>

<p>The Collection of Regino is entitled "De ecclesiasticis disciplinis et religione Christian&acirc;" (on the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>), and according to the preface was put together by order of Ratbod, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, as a handy manual for episcopal use in the course of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> visitations. Its two books treat: <ul><li>(1) of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, and <li>(2) of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>.</ul>

<p>Each book begins with a list (<em>elenchus</em>) of questions that indicate the points of chief importance in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. After this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Pr&uuml;m (died 915) adds the canons and <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> relative to each question. The collection was made about 906 and seems to depend on an earlier one edited by Richter under the title, "Antiqua Canonum collectio qua in libris de synodalibus causis compilandis usus est Regino Prumiensis" (Marburg, 1844). The text of Regino is found in P.L., CXXXII; a more critical edition is that of Wasserschleben, "Reginonis Abbatis Pr&uuml;m. libri duo de synodalibus causis" (Leipzig, 1840).
<h3>The "Capitula Abbonis"</h3>

<p>Abbo, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fleury (died 1004), dedicated to <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugues Capet</a> (died 996) and his son Robert (therefore before the end of the tenth century) a collection in fifty-six chapters, dealing with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and their relations with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Besides the canons and <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a>, he made use of the Capitularies, the Roman <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>; his collection is peculiar in that he enclosed within his own context the texts quoted by him. This collection is found in the second volume of the "Vetera Analecta" of <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> (Paris, 1675-85), and is reprinted in P.L., CXXXI.
<h3>The "Collectarium Canonum" or "Libri decretorum" of Burchard of Worms</h3>

<p>This collection is in twenty books and was compiled by Burchard, an ecclesiastic of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Worms (1002-25), at the suggestion of Brunicho, <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of Worms, and with the aid of Walter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Albert. This is the work often called "Brocardus". Burchard follows quite closely the following order: <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, liturgy, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, delicts, sanctions, and criminal procedure. The nineteenth book was familiarly known as "Medicus" or "Corrector", because it dealt with the spiritual ailments of different classes of the faithful; it has been edited by Wasserschleben in "Bussordnungen der abendl&auml;ndischen Kirche" (Leipzig, 1851). The twentieth, which treats of Providence, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, and the end of the world, is therefore a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatise. The collection, composed between 1013 and 1023 (perhaps in 1021 or 1022), is not a mere compilation, but a revision of the ecclesiastical law from the standpoint of actual needs, and an attempt to reconcile various juridical antinomies or contradictions. Burchard is a predecessor of Gratian and, like the latter, was a very popular canonist in his time. It is to be regretted that he depends on the above-mentioned ninth-century collections and even added to their <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> documents and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> attributions. The two collections just described (Regino and Collectio Anselmo dedicata) were known and largely used by him. <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore</a> also furnished him more than 200 pieces. The entire collection is in P.L., CXL.
<h3>The "Collectio Duodecim Partium"</h3>

<p>Yet unedited; is by an unknown, but probably a German, author. It includes a great deal of Burchard, follows quite closely his order, and by most is held to have copied his material, though some believe it older than Burchard.
<h3>The collection in seventy-four books, or "Diversorum sententia Patrum"</h3>

<p>This collection, known to the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a> and <a href="../cathen/14565b.htm">Theiner</a>, is the subject of a careful study by Paul Fournier ("Le premier manuel canonique de ha r&eacute;forme du onzi&egrave;me si&egrave;cle" in "M&eacute;langes d'Arch&eacute;ologie et d'Histoire publi&eacute;s par l'Ecole Fran&ccedil;aise de Rome", 1894). He considers it a compilation of the middle of the eleventh century, done about the reign of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">St. Leo IX</a> (1048-54), and in the entourage of that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>; moreover, it was well known in and out of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and furnished to other collections not only their general order, but also much of their material. Fournier believes it the source of the collection of <a href="../cathen/01550d.htm">Anselm of Lucca</a>, of the "Tarraconensis" and the "Polycarpus" (see below), also of other collections specified by him. This collection is yet unedited; Fournier gives (op. cit.) the beginnings and endings (<em>Incipit, Explicit</em>) of all the titles, also references to their sources.
<h3>The collection of St. Anselm of Lucca</h3>

<p>This collection, wrongly adjudicated from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>. (1073-86), is divided into thirteen books, based on Burchard and the "Collectio Anselmo dedicata", and contains many <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> pieces; it also contains <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> not found in other collections, whence the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a> concluded that <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> consulted directly the pontifical archives. It has no preface; from the beginning (<em>Incipit</em>) of a Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> it is clear that <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> compiled the work during the pontificate and by order of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">St. Gregory VII</a> (died 1085). It passed almost entire into the Decretum of Gratian. A critical edition is owing to Fr. Thaner, who published the first four books under the title "Anselmi episcopi Lucensis collectio canonum una cum collectione minore Jussu Instituti Saviniani (Savigny) recensuit F. T." (Innsbruck, 1906).
<h3>The collection of Cardinal Deusdedit</h3>

<p>Created by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">St. Gregory VII</a>, Cardinal Deusdedit was enabled to use the correspondence (<em>Registrum</em>) of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, also the Roman archives. His work is dedicated to <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Victor III</a> (1086-87), the successor of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory</a>, and dates therefore from the reign of Victor; its four books on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy, the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony of Peter</a>, reflect the contemporary anxieties of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> entourage during this phase of the conflict between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the empire. We owe to Pio Martinueci (Venice, 1869) a very imperfect edition of this collection, and to Wolf de Granvell, professor at Gratz, a critical edition (Die Kanonessammlung des Kardinals Deusdedit, Paderborn, 1906).
<h3>The collection of Bonizo</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/02673a.htm">Bonizo</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sutri near <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, published, apparently a little later than 1089, a collection in ten books preceded by a brief preface. In this work he treats successively the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of divers classes of the faithful: <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rulers and inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, temporal authorities and their subjects, finally of the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> and the penitential canons. The fourth book only (De excellenti&acirc; Ecclesi&aelig; Roman&aelig;) has found an editor, <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Cardinal Mai</a>, in the seventh volume of his "Nova Bibliotheca Patrum" (Rome, 1854).
<h3>The "Polycarpus"</h3>

<p>A collection in eight books so called by its author, Gregory, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of San Crisogono, and dedicated to an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Compostella, of whose name only the initial "D." is given; in all probability he is Didacus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of that see from 1101 to 1120, which is therefore the approximate date of the "Polycarpus". It seems to depend on <a href="../cathen/01550d.htm">Anselm of Lucca</a> and on the "Collectio Anselmo dedicata", and the above-mentioned "Collection in Seventy-four Books"; the author, however, must have had access to the Roman archives. This collection is as yet unedited.
<h3>The collection of Yvo of Chartres</h3>

<p>Both by his writings and his acts this great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> exercised a pronounced influence on the development of canon law in the first quarter of the twelfth century (he died 1115 or 1117). We owe to Paul Fournier a profound study of his juridical activity (Les collections canoniques attribu&eacute;es &agrave; Yves de Chartres", Paris, 1897 and "Yves de Chartres et le droit canonique" in "Revue des questions historiques", 1898, LXII, 51, 385). Not to mention the "Tripartita" (see below), he has left us:

<h4 id="i">The "Decretum"</h4>

<p>The Decretum is a vast repertory in seventeen parts and three thousand seven hundred and sixty chapters; though roughly subdivided under the aforesaid seventeen <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, its contents are thrown together without order and seemingly represent undigested results of the author's studies and researches; hence it has been surmised that the "Decretum" is a mere preparatory outline of the "Panormia" (see below), its material in the rough. <a href="../cathen/14565b.htm">Theiner</a> does not admit that the "Decretum" is the work of <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Yvo</a>; it is, nevertheless, generally accepted that <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Yvo</a> is the author, or at least that he directed the compilation. Nearly all of Burchard is found therein, and in addition a host of canonical texts, also Roman and <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> law texts gathered from Italian sources. Fournier dates it between 1090 and 1095. It is found in P.L., CLXI.

<h4 id="ii">The "<em>Panormia</em>"</h4>

<p>The Panormia, admittedly a work of <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Yvo</a>. It is much shorter than the "Decretum" (having only eight books) and is also more compact and orderly. Its material is taken from the Decretum, but it offers some additions, particularly in the third and fourth books. It seems to have been composed about 1095, and appears at that time as a kind of methodical <em>Summa</em> of the canon law; with Burchard it divided popularity in the next fifty years, i.e. until the appearance of the "Decretum" of Gratian.
<h3>The "Tripartita"</h3>

<p>The Tripartita, so called because of its triple division. It contains in its first part <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> as late as <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> (died 1099), and is therefore not of later date; its second part offers canons of the councils after the "Hispana" text; the third part contains extracts from the Fathers and from the Roman and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> law. Hitherto it was supposed to have been taken from the "Decretum" of <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Yvo</a> or composed by some unknown author. Fournier, however, thinks that only the third book postdates the "Decretum", and then as an abridgment (A). The other two books he considers a trial-essay of the "Decretum", by <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Yvo</a> himself, or by some writer who worked under his direction while he laboured at the vast bulk of the "Decretum". These two books, according to Fournier, formed a separate collection (A) later on joined to the above-mentioned third book (B), in which manner arose the actual "Tripartita". In this hypothesis many chapters in the "Decretum" were borrowed from the afore-mentioned (A) collection, whose nucleus is found in its extracts from <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore</a> completed from divers other sources, especially by use of a collection of Italian origin, now kept in the British Museum. hence known as the "Britannica". The "Tripartita" is yet unedited.
<h3>Various collections</h3>

<p>All three of these above-described collections (Decretum, Panormia, Tripartita) called for and found abridgements. Moreover, new collections arose, owing to fresh additions to these great compilations and new combinations with other similar works. Among them are: <ul><li>(1) The "C&aelig;saraugustana", so called because found in a <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near Saragossa. It seems to have been compiled in Aquitaine, and contains no <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> later than Paschal II (died 1118), which suggests its composition at a previous date. Its fifteen books borrow much from the "Decretum" of <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Yvo of Chartres</a>. <li>(2) The "Collection in Ten Parts", compiled in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> between 1125 and 1130, an enlarged edition of the "Panormia". <li>(3) The "Summa-Decretorum" of Haymo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a> (1153), an abridgment of the preceding.</ul>

<p>Antonius Augustinus (q.v.), who made known in the sixteenth century the "C&aelig;saraugustana", revealed also the existence of the "Tarraconensis", which came to him from the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Ploblete, near Tarragona. It is in six books and has no documents later than the reign of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (died 1085). It belongs, therefore, to the end of the eleventh century; the "Correctores Romani", to whom we owe (1572-85) the official edition of the "Corpus Juris canonici", made use of the "Tarraconensis". Fournier called attention to two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of this collection, one in the Vatican, the other in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (see above, the <em>Collection in Seventy-four Books</em>).
