<h1>College and Church of the Anima (in Rome)</h1>  

<p>S. Maria dell' Anima, the German national church and hospice in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, received its name, according to tradition, from the picture of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> which forms its <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> (the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> between two <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>). It was founded as early as 1350, as a private hospice for German <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, and was erected on its present site in 1386, by Johann Peters of Dodrecht, officer of the Papal Guard, and his wife. <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Pope Boniface IX</a> granted it <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> in 1398. In 1406, it was raised by the German colony to the rank of a national institution and united with a Brotherhood governed by Provisors and a Congregation. The foundation was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a>, who exempted it from all but <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and took it under his immediate protection. In 1418, it was greatly enriched by the legacy of its second founder, <a href="../cathen/04789b.htm">Diedrich of Niem</a>. The Popes of the fifteenth century, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, showed it great favour. United, in 1431, with the German hospice of St. Andrew which had been founded in 1372, by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Nicholas of Kulm, it became during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the German national and religious centre in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as well as burial place; in short, it became synonymous with the German nation in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in its remarkable Community Book (unscientifically edited at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1875) the most important names may be found.

<p>The chief "Protectors" of this period were: Theodorich of Niem (1406); Johann of Montmart (1427); Gerhard of Elten (1431); Johann Rode (1431); Heinrich Senftleben (1450); Nicolaus Tungen (1462); Albert Cock (1468); Melchior Neckau (1479); Johann Burkhard of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (1494); Bernhard Sculteti (1503); Kaspar Wirt (1506); Wilhelm of Enckenwort (1509); Jakob Apocellus (1530); Martin Lupi (1536); Peter Vorstius (1543); Jodokus Hoetfilder (1548); Kaspar Hoyer (1551); Alexander Junius (1557); Johann Fonck (1558); Kaspar Gropper (1564); Gerhard Voss (1584); Klemens Sublindius (1586); Richard Stravius (1589). These were followed, later, by: Lambert de Vivardis (1595); Hermann Ortenberg (1602); Johann Baptist Rembold (1614); Aegidius de Vivariis (1619); <a href="../cathen/07397a.htm">Lukas Holstenius</a> (1635); Theodorich Amayden (1636); the two Gualterii, and the two Emerix.

<p>The present church which owes its <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style to the influence of <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a>, was built by German subscriptions, between 1499 and 1526. It stands on the site of the older church, built between 1431 and 1499, and was decorated by the great artists of the period. Among its treasures is the famous Holy Family of <a href="../cathen/06572a.htm">Giulio Romano</a>. It is the resting place of the last German Pope, <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a>, as well as of Cardinals Enckenwort, Gropper, Andrew of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Slusius and the Hereditary Prince of Cleve (1575). Although the Emperor Maximilian I took the institution under his special imperial protection in 1518, it fell off greatly, during the period of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> strife; it remained nevertheless a stronghold of German influence and a refuge to all Germans in need. After <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, the Anima grew in political importance as well, inasmuch as during the great events that took place in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and during the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>, it came to be looked upon by the nation, the national representatives, and even by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, as a national work of thanksgiving and supplication to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The violent interference of the Ambassador Martinitz in 1697 (confirmed by an edict of Leopold I in 1699), ushered in the most eventful period in the history of the Anima. In 1742 the Congregation decided in favour of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> and against the Emperor. In 1798, the French plundered the church and took possession of it as the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the French Republic (in behalf of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>), but were driven out by the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> troops. An attempt on the part of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> to annex this institution was also defeated. These vicissitudes had the effect of gradually changing the house from what its original founders had intended to be and of turning it over, almost entirely, to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>. It was only in 1853 that the noble determination of the Emperor Francis Joseph I restored it to its former purpose. He opened the institution to his Austrian subjects, and brought about its reorganization by means of an Apostolic Visitation in 1859 (Brief of 15 March).

<p>From that time forward the Anima has gradually regained its old position, by timely adaptation to modern conditions. Its field of action is extending, step by step, to the boundaries of the German-speaking peoples. It has been the originator and support of almost every new German national undertaking in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It possesses a special importance as the place where religious services are held on the occasion of political or national festivals, as <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of the German colony, and as the centre in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of national charitable associations. It is also a hospice for German <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, and the stopping place of German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and America. It acts, at the same time, as intermediary for Austrian and German <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in their relations with the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, and serves as a home for German-speaking <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>The Anima, as a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, dates back to the year 1496, and was founded by the well known Master of Papal Ceremonies, Burkhard of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>. As early as the sixteenth century it consisted of fourteen <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. No noteworthy <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, however, are to be found among them, for the reason that they held their positions for an indefinite term, or even for life. Notwithstanding numerous attempts at reform, especially that of 1584, the moral condition of the college left much to be desired. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> destroyed it, and, in particular, eliminated the German elements. It was only after the restoration of 1859 that the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was reorganized (1863). The brief of reorganization, placed prominently in the refectory, enjoins that the members of the college "shall acquire a better and more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> matters in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and shall study the transaction of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, so that each may carry to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the methods of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>." The two years' residence in the college affords special opportunities for the study of canon law in theory at the Papal <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and in practice under the higher church officials. It is for this reason that many students of the Anima are promoted, on their return home, to positions of trust and authority in their respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The list of deserving men who, since its restoration, have gone forth from this training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, no fewer than 300 in all, includes eleven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and twenty <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professors. In addition to the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, whom the German and Austrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appoint in regular succession, other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are admitted on moderate terms, so that there are twenty-one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> now residing in the house. The college is governed by a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, who controls the spiritual management under a Cardinal Protector (at present H.E. Cardinal Steinhueber), and the temporal, under Austrian protection, assisted by a <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was the well known writer and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professor, Alois Flir, the restorer of the institution, who died in 1859 as auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a>. He was succeeded by Michael Gassner, afterwards Dean of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a> (1860-72), by Karl Jaenig of Prague (1875-87); Franz Doppelbauer, now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a> (1887-89); Franz Vogl, now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15045a.htm">Triest</a> (1889-1902) and by Protonotary Joseph Lohninger of <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a> (since 1902).
