<h1>College of Saint Isidore</h1>  

<p>The College of Saint Isidore, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was originally founded for the use of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>. In the year 1625 the buildings passed into the hands of <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Father Luke Wadding</a>, who, after making numerous additions and alterations, and with the sanction of the General of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and of the Sovereign Pontiff, converted them into a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> students. Within a few years, <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> had provided accommodation for, and had gathered within the walls of the new college, a community of over thirty religious; and some years later the number had increased to fifty. <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> was fortunate in being able to assure the success of the new undertaking by attracting to the college as professors some of the ablest members of the order at the time, all of them countrymen of his own. These included such men as Hickey, Fleming, <a href="../cathen/12227b.htm">Ponce</a>, Walsh, and some years later <a href="../cathen/07141a.htm">Harold</a>, <a href="../cathen/10442b.htm">Molloy</a>, and Bonaventure Baron. The last mentioned alone has to his credit no fewer than twenty-two volumes, in the various domains of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, history, and poetry. It is easy to understand what prestige such distinguished teachers must have brought to the college. In fact, within thirty years of its foundation, we find no fewer than seventy of its <em>alumni</em> engaged as professors in various <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the order. But its claim to recognition does not rest less in the stimulus which it gave to the study of <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotistic</a> philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> during the seventeenth century than in the number of highly trained and efficient teachers which it sent forth. Its professors were all convinced adherents of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and it is no exaggeration to say that, at a time when the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> were beginning to lose favour even amongst <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> themselves, they found no more ardent nor able defenders than the professors of St. Isidore's College. It is to <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> and his fellow-workers in the college that we owe the first complete edition of the Subtile Doctor's works, namely, the Lyons edition of 1639. While sending forth, year after year, numbers of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> workers into the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> mission, the college continued to possess amongst its professors men of acknowledged learning and merit.

<p>On the occupation of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the French in 1798, St. Isidore's suffered the fate of other British institutions in the city. The <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were expelled, and the college and adjoining garden confiscated and put up for auction. They were bought in by the Prince of Piombino, who let the rooms out to lodgers, with the exception of a few which were reserved for one of the fathers who had volunteered to keep watch over the place until the advent of better times. These came with the return of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1814. The college was soon restored to its rightful owners, and the year 1819 saw Father Hughes installed as superior over a fresh band of students who had come from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to fill the places of those who had been expelled in 1798. Since then St. Isidore's has remained in undisturbed possession of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, for whom it still serves as the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> training-house of their students. Amongst its <em>alumni</em> may be mentioned Dr. Egan (d. 1814), first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia; Drs. Lambert (d. 1817), Scallan (d. 1830), and <a href="../cathen/10629b.htm">Mullock</a> (d. 1869), the two former <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, and the latter second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. John's, Newfoundand; Dr. Hughes, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/06550a.htm">Gibraltar</a>; and Drs. Geoghegan (d. 1864) and Shiel (d. 1872), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Adelaide, Australia. The college <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> is famous for its collection of rare and valuable books. Owing to <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding's</a> position as <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> and agent with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for his native country during the stormy period of the Insurrection of 1641, the archives of St. Isidore's became the repository of many precious documents relating to <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> subjects and to the civil and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> during the seventeenth century. Such among the valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> belonging to the sister college of St. Anthony's, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, as escaped destruction or dispersion during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> also found, for a time, a domicile in St. Isidore's. They included many of those old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> saved from destruction by Brother Michael O'Clery, during his tours of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in search of material for the "Annals of the Four Masters". They are sometimes referred to as the "St. Isidore <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>" After the taking of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> in 1870, these, together with such others as had any bearing on the civil or <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, were for greater security removed to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the order at Merchant's Quay, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, where they are now preserved.
