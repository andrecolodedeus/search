<h1>Collegiate</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>collegiatus</em>, from <em>collegium</em>)

<p>An adjective applied to those churches and institutions whose members form a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">COLLEGE</a>). The origin of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and collegiate chapters, springing from the common life of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> attached to <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> and other important churches, has been treated in the article <a href="../cathen/03582b.htm">CHAPTER</a>, where special attention is given to what regards <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> capitulars (see <a href="../cathen/03582b.htm">CHAPTER</a>). Collegiate churches were formed on the model of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a>, and the collegiate canons have <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> similar to the capitulars of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, except that they have no voice in the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, even when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is vacant. Their main object is the solemn celebration of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in choir. Already in the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> many wealthy collegiate churches had been founded throughout his empire, especially in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, of which that at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> was the most celebrated. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> there was also a large number of these institutions, and at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, when they were dissolved, the revenues of some of them were used for founding public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The founding of a collegiate church gives the founder no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to nominate its members unless he have received a special <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">papal indult</a> to that effect.

<p>For the erection of collegiate institutions, the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refers the matter to the consideration of the Congregation of the Council, which makes a favourable report if certain conditions are found fulfilled, such as: the dignity of the city, the large number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, the size and beauty of the church structure, the splendour of its belongings, and the sufficiency of the income. Although the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot erect a collegiate church, yet, if the college, owing to the death of canons or other similar cause, should cease as an active corporation but still retain, <em>de jure</em>, its status as a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can restore it, for this would not be a canonical erection. As the ordinary cannot erect a collegiate church, so neither can he reduce it to a merely <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> status, and still less has he the power to suppress one. Only the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> can formally dissolve a collegiate foundation. A church loses its collegiate dignity by the will of the members, or the act of the supreme <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, or the death of all the canons. When the right of an institution which claims the collegiate dignity is disputed, the question is to be decided by certain signs which create a presumption in its favour. These are, among others, an immemorial reputation as a collegiate institution, a common seal proper to a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, capitular meetings of the members under the presidency of a dean, the making of contracts in the name of the college, the right of electing a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> dependent on the chapter.

<p>Although collegiate churches are ordinarily under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, yet its members are not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to render any service to the ordinary outside of their own churches, except in case of necessity or through contrary custom. Neither can the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter interfere with the chapter of a collegiate church when the latter remains within its own right and privileges. Collegiate churches are distinguished into <em>insignes</em> (famous) and <em>non insignes</em>. There are, however, no rules given in canon law to discern one from the other. Canonists declare that a church is <em>insignis</em> if it be the mother church of the locality, have right of precedence in solemn functions, be of ancient foundation, and conspicuous by its structure and the number of its dignitaries and members, and likewise be situated in a famous or well-populated city. The canons of a church which is <em>insignis</em> have precedence over the canons of other collegiate institutions at Synods and in public processions. When a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> church is elevated to collegiate rank, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> does not necessarily pass to the chapter, but may remain with the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. When the chapter has the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> and its votes are equally divided, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may decide as to which part of the canons has presented a candidate of superior merit to the other. If, however, the merits of the candidates be equal, the decision must be referred to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, if the chapter cannot agree after taking two ballots. The chapters of collegiate churches, by <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, have the right of electing or presenting candidates for the dignities and <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> of their chapter. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of confirmation and installation belong to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Many innovations on these <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> have been made by special decrees or customs, and, according to the prevailing discipline, account must be taken of the so-called pontifical reservations, or the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has reserved to himself, especially as regards the highest dignity of the chapter, and also of the legitimate privileges possessed by patrons in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, etc. of nominating and presenting candidates. These privileges are still in force in many instances.
