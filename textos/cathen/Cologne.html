<h1>Cologne</h1>  

<p>(German K&Ouml;LN or C&Ouml;LN), German city and <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>.
<h2>The city</h2>

<p>Cologne, in size the third city of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and the capital of the district (<em>Regierungsbezirk</em>) of Cologne, is situated in the lowlands of the lower Rhine on both sides of the river. Its area is 45 square miles; its population (1 December, 1905), 428,722, of whom 339,790 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 76,718 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 11,035 of other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>.

<p>The history of Cologne goes back to the first century before Christ. After Marcus Agrippa transplanted the Ubii from the right to the left bank of the Rhine (38 B.C.), Ara Ubiorum, the centre of the civil and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> of this tribe, occupied the site of the modern Cologne. In A.D. 50 Agrippina, the daughter of Germanicus, founded here a colony of veterans called Colonia Agrippina; the inhabitants of the two settlements mingled freely with each other, while the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> gradually assumed Roman customs. After the revolt of the Batavians, Cologne was made the capital of a Roman province and was repeatedly the residence of the imperial court. At an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> came to Cologne with the Roman soldiers and traders; according to <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus of Lyons</a>, it was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> see as early as the second century. However, Saint Maternus, a contemporary of Constantine, is the first historically certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cologne. As a result of its favourable situation, the city survived the stormy period of the migrations of the Teutonic tribes. When the Ripuarian <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> took possession of the country in the fifth century, it became the residence of their king. On account of the services of the Bishops of Cologne to the Merovingian kings, the city was to have been the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Saint Boniface</a>, but <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> was chosen, for unknown reasons, and Cologne did not become an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> until the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The city suffered heavily from invasions of the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a>, especially in the autumn of 881, but recovered quickly from these calamities, especially during the reign of the Saxon emperors and of such vigorous <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> as Bruno, Heribert, Piligrun, and others.

<p>In the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries Cologne attained great prosperity. The basis of this prosperity was the commercial activity of the city, which placed it in relation not only with Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, but also with <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. The local crafts also flourished; the spinners, weavers, and dyers, the woollen-drapers, goldsmiths, sword-cutlers, and armour-makers of Cologne were especially celebrated. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> importance of the city was equally great; no city north of the Alps was so rich in great churches, sanctuaries, <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. It was known as the "German <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>," and was annually visited by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, especially after <a href="../cathen/12634c.htm">Rainald of Dassel</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cologne (1159-67), brought thither the remains of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Three Magi</a> from <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Learning was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> cultivated in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, in the collegiate chapters, and the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>; famous <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> taught here, among them Rupert of Deutz, <a href="../cathen/03137a.htm">Caesarius of Heisterbach</a>, <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, and Blessed <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>. The arts also flourished, on account of the numerous churches and civil buildings. With the growth of the municipal prosperity, the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the citizens and their desire for independence also increased, and caused them to feel more dissatisfied with the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. This resulted in bitter feuds between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the city, which lasted for two centuries with varying fortunes. The first uprising occurred under Anno II, at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> of the year 1074; the citizens rose against the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, but were defeated within three days, and severely punished. They received important concessions from Archbishop Henry I of Molenark (1225-38) and his successor, the powerful Conrad of Hostaden (1238-1261), who laid the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The bloody battle of Worringen in 1288, in which the citizens of Cologne allied with Brabant took <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> Archbishop Siegfried of Westerburg (1274-97), resulted in an almost complete freedom for the city; to regain his liberty, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> recognized the political independence of Cologne, but reserved certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, notably the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>A long period of peace with the outside world followed. Cologne joined the Hanseatic League in the thirteenth century, and became an imperial free city in the fourteenth. On the other hand internal dissensions frequently disturbed the city. After the close of the twelfth century the government of the city was in the hands of patrician <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, who filled all the offices in the city government with members of their own order. In time the craft organizations (guilds) increased in strength and demanded a share in the government. As early as 1370, in the uprising of the weavers, they gained the upper hand for a short time, but it was not until 1396 that the rule of the patricians was finally abolished. On 14 September of that year the new democratic constitution was adopted, in accordance with which only representatives of the guilds sat in the city council. The last act of the patricians was the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">university</a> (1388), which rapidly began to prosper. By their firmness and wisdom the new rulers maintained themselves against the patricians, against Archbishop Dietrich of M&ouml;rs (1419), and against Charles the Bold, who, in alliance with Archbishop Ruprecht, sought to bring the city again under <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> rule. It also suppressed domestic uprisings (for instance in 1481 and 1512). Throughout this period the city retained its place as the first city of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, in which learning, the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, and the art of printing were vigorously cultivated.

<p>In the religious upheavals of the sixteenth century Cologne remained true to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, thanks chiefly to the activity of the <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">university</a>, where such men as Cochl&aelig;us, Ortwin Gratianus, Jacob of Hoogstraeten, and others taught. Under their influence, the city council held fast to <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> and energetically opposed the new doctrines, which found many adherents among the people and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Cologne remained a stronghold of the old <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, and gave active support to the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>, which found earnest champions in <a href="../cathen/07036b.htm">Johannes Gropper</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/11756c.htm">Saint Peter Canisius</a>, and others. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a time of decadence for the city; its importance diminished especially after the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> (1618-48) in which it was loyal to the emperor and the empire, and was never captured. The <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">university</a> eventually lost its prestige, because through over-caution it opposed the most justifiable reforms; trade was diverted to other channels; only its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> glory remained to the city, which was governed by a narrow-minded class of tradesmen and often suffered from the dissensions between council and citizens (in 1679-86 and the bloody troubles caused by Nicholas Guelich). The outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> found it a community with but slight power of resistance. The French entered Cologne, 26 October, 1794, and the citizens were soon severely oppressed by requisitions, forced loans, and contributions. On 27 September, 1797, the old city constitution was finally annulled, the French administrative organization established, and the city made a part of the French department of the Roer of which Aix-la-Chapelle (<a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>) was the capital. The <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">university</a> was discontinued in 1798; it had dragged out a miserable existence owing to the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">University of Bonn</a> and the confused policy of the last <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. After the downfall of French domination in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Cologne was apportioned by the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. It was made neither the seat of the government of the Rhenish Province, nor the seat of the <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">university</a>, but it was restored to its rank of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, and in the nineteenth century, under <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> rule became the third largest city of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and attained unusual prosperity, <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a>, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>.



<p>Only brief ecclesiastical statistics can be given here. In 1907, besides the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and assistant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, there were in Cologne 214 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom 24 were members of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter and 38 were <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 128 others engaged in pastoral occupations. There are 12 <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and 9 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. The two deaneries of the city embrace 39 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and 3 military churches; in addition to the 39 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, there are 22 lesser churches and 26 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. Religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are numerous and powerful among more than 400 religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> and brotherhoods we may mention: Societies of Saint Vincent, Saint Elizabeth, and <a href="../cathen/02688c.htm">Saint Charles Borromeo</a>, Marian congregations for young men and for young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">rosary confraternities</a>, Associations the Holy Childhood, Holy Family, of Christian Mothers, etc. Among the trades organization the most powerful are the four <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Gesellenvereine, with 4 hospices and 18 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> workingmens' unions. The male <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations are represented by <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Alexian Brothers, Brothers of Charity, and Brothers of Saint Francis; the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders and congregations by Sisters of Saint Benedict, the <a href="../cathen/02688c.htm">Borromean Sisterhood</a>, the Cellites, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Sisters of Saint Dominic</a>, Sisters of Saint Francis, Sisters of the Good Shepherd, Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus, the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline Sisters</a>, and Sisters of Saint Vincent; a total of 43 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> with about 1140 inmates. The Alexian Brothers, the Brothers of Charity, and the Brothers of Saint Francis, as well as almost all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, conduct numerous charitable and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>.

<p>Among the churches of Cologne, the foremost is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the greatest monument of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Its cornerstone was laid by Archbishop Conrad of Hostaden, 14 August, 1248; the sanctuary was dedicated in 1322; the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> made ready for religious services in 1388; the southern tower was built to a height of about 180 feet in 1447; then the work of building was interrupted for almost four hundred years. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was degraded to a hay barn. In the nineteenth century the work of building was resumed, thanks above all to the efforts of Sulpice Boisseree, who excited the enthusiasm of the Crown Prince, afterwards King Frederick William IV, for the completion of the work. The restoration was begun in 1823; in 1842 the Cathedral Building Society was founded, and generous contributions from all parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> resulted. The interior was finished, 15 October, 1863, and opened for Divine service; and 15 October, 1880, the completion of the entire <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was appropriately celebrated in the presence of the German emperor. The whole edifice covers an area of about 7370 square yards; it has a <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> 445 feet long, five <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> 282 feet wide with three <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>; the height of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> is about 202 feet, that of the two towers, 515 feet. Among the numerous works of art, the most famous are the picture (<em>Dombild</em>) <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by <a href="../cathen/09319c.htm">Stephen Lochner</a> about 1450, the triptych over the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, the 96 choir seats of the sanctuary, and the shrine in which are kept the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Three Kings</a> in the treasury of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>. The last is considered the most remarkable <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> example of the goldsmith's art extant. Among the other churches of the city, the most noteworthy of those <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the Romanesque period are Saint Gereon, <a href="../cathen/15225d.htm">Saint Ursula</a>, Saint Mary in the Capitol, <a href="../cathen/11447a.htm">Saint Pantaleon</a>, and the church of the Apostles; from the Transition and the Gothic periods, Saint Cunibert, Saint Mary in Lyskirchen, the church of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>; from more recent times, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church, Saint Mary Pantaleon, and Saint Mauritius. The city contains about 25 <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> management.
<h2>The archbishopric</h2>

<p>According to ancient legend a disciple of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Saint Peter</a> was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cologne, but the first historically authenticated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Saint Maternus, who was present in 314 at the Synod of Arles. Among the earliest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the most prominent are: Euphrates, who took part in the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (344) and in 346 was deposed as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> by a general synod of Gaul; Saint Severinus (347-400), Saint Cunibert (623-63?), councillor of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kings Dagobert and Sigibert; Anno I (711-15), who brought the remains of <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">Saint Lambert</a> from Maastricht to <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>; <a href="../cathen/01211a.htm">Saint Agilulfus</a> (747-51); Hildebold (785-819), chancellor under <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and, in 799, first <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of Cologne, whose suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> were <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, Muenster, <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, and, after 829, Minden. During the vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal office</a> (842-50) Bremen was cut off from the Archdiocese of Cologne, in spite of the protests of Gunthar (850-71). Willibert (870-89) assisted Ludwig the German to overcome Charles the Bald, by which action the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> became finally a part of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. Under Hermann I (890-924) Bremen was definitively separated from Cologne. In 954 Bruno I (953-65) was made Duke of Lorraine by his brother, the Emperor Otto the Great; in this way the foundation was laid for the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> of Cologne. For though Bruno's successors did not inherit the ducal rank, they retained a considerable territory (the <em>K&ouml;lngau</em>, or district of Cologne), in time increased by the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> possessions and acquisitions of many <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/07264a.htm">Saint Heribert</a> (999-1021) was very active in promoting the welfare of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was made chancellor for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, and aided Henry II at the time of his expedition to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1004. <a href="../cathen/12099a.htm">Piligrim</a> (1021-36), who accompanied Henry II and Conrad II on their expeditions to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, obtained for himself and for his successors the office of imperial chancellor for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Hermann II (1036-56) was followed by <a href="../cathen/01541b.htm">Saint Anno</a> II, who did much for the authority and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the See of Cologne; at the same time he was the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to come into open conflict with the city, now rapidly growing in numbers and wealth.

<p>As princes of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> were very frequently involved in dissensions between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and emperors, often to the injury of their Church, since they were frequently in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Frederick I (1100-31) was the last <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cologne to be invested with the episcopal ring and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>; in 1111, during the three-days fight in the streets of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he saved the <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Emperor Henry V</a> from defeat, after his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pope Paschal II</a>, but in 1114 abandoned the imperial party. His successor, Bruno II (1132-37), was again imperial chancellor for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which office, after the incumbency of Arnold II of Wied (1151-56), was permanently attached to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cologne. <a href="../cathen/12634c.htm">Rainald of Dassel</a> (1159-67), the chancellor of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, and Philip I of Heinsberg (1167-91) increased the prestige of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>; the latter <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, after the fall of Henry the Lion, obtained as a fief for himself and his successors the western part of the Duchy of Saxony, under the title of Duke of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> and Engern. One of the most energetic <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> in the following years was <a href="../cathen/05429c.htm">Saint Engelbert</a>. In his short reign (1216-21) he furthered the moral and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> by several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and by the favour he showed the new orders of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>; he also restored order within the limits of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and successfully opposed the continued efforts for civic independence. The long political conflict between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and the city, during which Conrad of Hostaden (1238-61) and Engelbert II of Falkenburg (1261-74) made many concessions was finally, as above stated, settled in favour of the city, under Siegfried of Westerburg (1274-97). The reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> with the city effected by Wikbold of Holte (1297-1304) brought with it increasing influence in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. To the injury of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, Henry II of Virneburg (1304-32) allied himself with Frederick the Handsome, while Walram of Juelich (1332-49) obtained many privileges from the Emperor Charles IV, whom he had raised to the imperial dignity against Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. In his time the Black Death spread over <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and entailed great misery. In 1356, under William of Gennep (1349-62), the dignity of imperial elector, recognized since about the middle of the thirteenth century as belonging to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal office</a>, was formally acknowledged by the Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Kuno of Falkenstein (1366-71), also <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, added (1370) to the temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> the County of Arnsberg. After his resignation he was succeeded by Frederick III of Saarwerden (1370-1414), who adhered to <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>; after <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban's</a> death he followed a vacillating policy. His successor, Dietrich II of M&ouml;rs (1414-63), sought to make Cologne the strongest territorial power in Western <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but he was unfortunate in his political enterprises, and brought a heavy burden of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> on his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Under him the city of Soest was lost to Cologne. After his death, and before the appointment of a new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, the nobility (<em>Ritterschaft</em>) and the cities of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> state (<em>Erzstift</em>) concluded an agreement (<em>Erblandsvereinigung</em>) with regard to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> hereditary lands, whereby the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate's</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as temporal lord were considered limited in the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archepiscopal</a> State, whose territory, it must be remembered, did not coincide with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> limits of the archdiocese. This agreement was henceforth sworn to by each <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> at his election. Ruprecht von der Pfalz (1463-80) squandered the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, sought by force to gain control of the cities and castles previously mortgaged, and thereby entered into conflicts with the holders of the mortgages. Violence, arson, and devastation visited the diocese in consequence. In 1478 Ruprecht was captured and remained a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> until his death. His successor, Hermann IV of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, devoted his energy to the restoration of order, paid a part of the public <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, and, by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod of 1483, whose decrees he vigorously enforced, furthered the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral elevation of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. Philip II of Daun (1508-15) walked in the footsteps of his predecessor.

<p>The government of Hermann V of Wied (1515-47) brought trouble and disaster on his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. At the Diet of Worms he at first opposed the religious doctrines of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. He urged the banning of the Reformer and held a provincial synod in 1536; gradually, however, he turned away from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, chose adherents of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> for his counsellors, and allowed the new doctrines to be preached in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. When he openly favoured the spread of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, he was suspended in 1546, and forced to resign (1547). By the advice of excellent men, such as <a href="../cathen/07036b.htm">Gropper</a>, <a href="../cathen/02566b.htm">Billick</a>, and others, Adolph III of Schauenburg (1546-56) took strong measures against the preachers brought in by Hermann, and published vigorous decrees against immoral <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. His brother Anton (1556-58) followed a similar course. Under Johann Gebhard of Mansfeld (1558-62) <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> ceased to be a suffragan of Cologne, and the Deanery of Zyfflich was incorporated with the newly founded <a href="../cathen/13110a.htm">See of Roermond</a>. After the brief reign of Frederick IV of Wied (1562-67) and that of the vigorous Salentin of Isenburg (1567-77), who resigned because he did not wish to take <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders, Gebhard II Truchsess of Waldburg, succeeded to the office. He followed the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> course of Hermann of Wied. At first loyal to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he became a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> in 1582, owing to his passion for Agnes von Mansfeld, and sought to Protestantize the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1583; he was put under the ban of the empire and deposed, and Duke Ernest of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> chosen as his successor. With <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> aid Gebhard sought to keep possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. But the War of Cologne (<em>K&ouml;lnischer Krieg</em>), which lasted five years, and brought untold misery on the land, ended in victory for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party. These attempts of Hermann of Wied and Gebhard to alienate the archdiocese from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> led to the establishment of a permanent <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> nunciature in Cologne which existed from 1584 to the extinction of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> State at the end of the eighteenth century (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">NUNCIO</a>; <a href="../cathen/13677a.htm">SECULARIZATION</a>).

<p>Ernest of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1583-1612) was the first of the five princes of the house of Wittelsbach who held the Electorate of Cologne until 1761. Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1612-50), Maximilian Henry (1650-88), Joseph Clemens (1688-1723), and Clemens Augustus I (1727-61) succeeded him. Following the tradition of their princely house, these five <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> were intensely loyal to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and upheld <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the archdiocese, which, however, had lost 122 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. However, in consequence of the repeated union of several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in the hands of these <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, the political administration of the territory was held to be of primary, its religious government of secondary, importance. Moreover, the foreign policy of these five <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> was not always fortunate. By their alliance with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, especially during the Spanish and Austrian Wars of Succession, they furthered the political dissolution of the old <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> (begun in the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>) and encouraged the anti-Hapsburg policy of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> which aimed at the final overthrow of the German imperial power. Similarly, their friendly relations to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> favoured the introduction of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> into Cologne. This spirit of opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had a still stronger hold upon Archbishop Maximilian Frederick of K&ouml;nigseck (1761-84). In 1771 he founded an academy at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> in opposition to the loyal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">University of Cologne</a>, and in 1781 issued in favour of the new academy an order according to which attendance at the <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">University of Cologne</a> was punished by inability to hold any office, either <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or civil, in the diocese. The last Elector of Cologne, Maximilian Francis of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1785-1801), took part in the anti-papal Congress of Ems, nominated Eulogius Schneider as professor in the Academy of Bonn, which he raised to the rank of a University in 1786, and instituted reforms similar to those enacted by his brother, the <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>, in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. As brother of <a href="../cathen/09665a.htm">Marie Antoinette</a>, he was at first opposed to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, but soon adopted a policy of inactivity which ultimately resulted in the loss of independence both by the city and the electorate. At the approach of the victorious French army the elector left his residence at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, never to see it again. The French entered Cologne, 26 October, 1794, and Bonn, 8 November. The conquered territory between the Meuse, the Rhine, and the Moselle was divided into four departments governed by a civil commissioner at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and incorporated with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by the Peace of Luneville in 1801. In 1796 all the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> in the part of the archdiocese held by the French was seized by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>; in 1802 all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations were suppressed, and their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> confiscated. By the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> between the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, nearly all of the former archdiocese on the left bank of the Rhine was given to the newly founded <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">See of Aachen</a>. The old <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization remained undisturbed in the archdiocesan territory on the right bank of the Rhine. After the death of Maximilian Francis (1801), the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, which had taken refuge in Arnsberg, chose the Austrian Archduke Anthony as his successor, but he never occupied his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, owing to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> opposition. In 1803 the remainder of the electorate was secularized, an inglorious end for the ancient Archbishopric of Cologne. The loss to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was great. The <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, i.e., the territory in which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was also temporal ruler, included in its Rhenish territory alone (without <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>) 60 square miles and about 199,000 inhabitants (in 1797), of whom 180,000 were on the left bank of the Rhine.

<p>In 1750 the archdiocese contained 860 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with as many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 300 <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, 400 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 42 collegiate chapters, 21 <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> (10 <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, 4 <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>), 5 <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> provostships, 18 <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a> and 24 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> houses of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>. There were also 20 <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> houses, 6 <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>, 11 Augustinian, 8 of <a href="../cathen/08671a.htm">Knights of the Cross</a>, 9 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> (<a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed</a> in 1773), 2 <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a>, and 2 Alexian. The Brothers of Saint Anthony, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, the Zionites, the Brothers of Saint Martin had each one house. There were five establishments of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> and nine of the Knights of Malta. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders had a total of 146 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunneries</a> (see below, Mooren, III, 426 sqq.). The loss in costly gold and silver church plate, vestments and the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> and archives, is incalculable. When the disorders of the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> regime had passed, the archdiocese was re-established by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. Its territory had previously been made a part of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> by the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, in 1815. On 16 July, 1821, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De Salute animarum" the <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Archdiocese of Aachen</a> was abolished, the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter in Cologne was again made a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church, and the territories of the Archdiocese of Cologne defined anew, with its present boundaries, except for a few unimportant changes. It then included 44 deaneries and 685 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (536 on the left bank of the Rhine and 149 on the right bank). On the 20th of December, 1824, Ferdinand August von Spiegel was named by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the new see; on 20 May, 1825, he took charge of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government, which had been carried on by the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>, Johann Hermann Joseph von Caspars zu Weiss, from 1801 till his death (1822), and after that time by Prothonotary Johann Wilhelm Schmitz. Archbishop von Spiegel's administration (1824-35) was in many ways beneficial. He alleviated many evils which had crept in during the previous years and made serious efforts for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and for the reorganization of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; nevertheless, he was too subservient to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government, and entered into a secret agreement with it in regard to <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, contrary to the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> marriage <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. His successor, <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">Clemens Augustus, Freiherr von Droste zu Vischering</a>, who vigorously opposed the spread of the <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermesian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, soon came into conflict with the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government on the question of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, as a result of which he was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, 20 November, 1837, and confined in the castle of <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>. This event caused great excitement throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and helped to revive the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and activity of the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. When Frederick William IV came to the throne, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> resigned his office in favour of his coadjutor, <a href="../cathen/06405a.htm">Johann von Geissel</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>. As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (1845-64), he displayed a most auspicious activity and infused fresh religious vigour into his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Great injury was done the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Cologne by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>. During its course <a href="../cathen/10156a.htm">Archbishop Paul Melchers</a> (1866-85) was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by the Government in 1874 (till 9 October), and then was forced to leave his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> fell from 1947 to about 1500, and many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> remained for years without a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. After the conclusion of peace between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/10156a.htm">Archbishop Melchers</a> abdicated his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. His successors, Philip Krementz (1885-99; <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, 1893), Hubert Simar (1899-1902), and Anton Fischer (since 6 November, 1902; <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> since 22 June, 1903) devoted themselves to repairing the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> done by the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> and developing to a prosperous state the religious and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.
<h2>Statistics</h2>
