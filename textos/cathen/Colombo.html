<h1>Colombo</h1>  

<p>The Archdiocese of Colombo, situated on the western seaboard of the Island of Ceylon, includes two of the nine provinces into which the island is divided, viz. the Western and the Northwestern. The history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> begins in 1518, when <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. The religion spread rapidly, the town and the surrounding districts were soon erected into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and Don Juan de Monteiro was created first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Colombo. This <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> received into the church Don Juan Dharmapala, the grandson of the Cingalese King Buwenekabahu VII. The young prince succeeded his grandfather in 1542. Six years after his accession, Colombo contained a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 12,000, with two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, Our Lady's and St. Laurence's, four <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> under the Cordeliers, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Augustinians, and <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>.

<p>In 1597 Don Juan Dharmapala died. By that time the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> had established their authority throughout the whole island except in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a> in the centre of the island, and religion was free to develop in <a href="../cathen/08269a.htm">Jaffna</a> and in the other parts of <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>. But peace was of short duration, for the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> arrived in the island and, after a struggle of more than fifty years, succeeded in obtaining possession of all the territory that had been held by the Portuguese; Colombo fell in 1656 and Jaffna in 1658. The new rulers made no secret of their attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for in 1642 they concluded with the King of <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a> a treaty by which "all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>" were to be banished from <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>. The Reformed Church of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> was declared established, and a series of severe penal enactments against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> followed. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was forbidden, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship abolished, and harbouring a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was declared a capital offence. In 1796 Colombo was taken by the English, and one of their first acts was to repeal all the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (1806); soon afterwards the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> restored to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the United Kingdom by the Emancipation Act were conceded to their coreligionists in Ceylon.

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> period the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration of the island had been in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> on the neighbouring continent; but in 1830 <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> constituted Ceylon a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> and the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, Don Vicente de Rozario, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1836. In 1845 <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to increase the number of missionaries in the island, and sent the <a href="../cathen/14372c.htm">Sylvestrine</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> for that purpose. In 1847 Jaffna in the north of the island, was severed from the Vicariate of Colombo, and erected into a separate vicariate with Bishop H. Bettachini as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. At his death in 1857, the northern vicariate was given over to the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a> who had arrived in Ceylon two years after the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. Bishop Semeria, O. M. I., was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/08269a.htm">Jaffna</a>, while Bishop Bravi, O. S. B., succeeded Bishop Caetano Antonio (1843-57) as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Colombo.

<p>A further partition was made in 1883, when the southern vicariate was divided into two, Colombo and <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> retained the latter, the former being given to the Oblates, in whose hands it has since remained, and Bishop C. Bonjean, O. M. I., was transferred from <a href="../cathen/08269a.htm">Jaffna</a> to Colombo. Three years later (1886) the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was established in <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, and the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Colombo, Dr. Bonjean, was made <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> with two suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, <a href="../cathen/08269a.htm">Jaffna</a> and <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>. In 1893 two new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were created and entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Galle in the South being severed from Colombo, and Trincomali in the East, separated from <a href="../cathen/08269a.htm">Jaffna</a>. In the same year Bishop Melizan, O. M. I., was transferred from <a href="../cathen/08269a.htm">Jaffna</a> to Colombo as successor to Bishop Bonjean who had died in 1892; Bishop Melizan was succeeded in 1905 by Bishop Antoine* Coudert, O. M. I., from 1898 coadjutor, with right of succession.

<p>According to the last census returns the total population of the archdiocese is 1,274,000, of whom 206,000 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. There are 100 missionaries, 91 Oblates and 9 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and 295 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The Cathedral of Santa Lucia, a fine building in the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style, has accommodations for 6000. Attached to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> are an English <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys and one for girls, the former with over a thousand pupils, being taught by the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, while in the latter, the Sisters of the Good Shepherd give instruction to 500 girls. All the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> in the archdiocese, and many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> of the archdiocese are in the hands of religious congregations. These are as follows: <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of Christian Schools</a>, 47 engaged in teaching; native Brothers of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, 20, teaching; Sisters of the Good Shepherd, 23, over <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>; Sisters of the Holy Family, 23, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters (Missionaries of Mary), 49, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; native Sisters of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, 117, teaching; native Sisters of St. Peter, 108, teaching. Three of the principal government <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> have been entrusted to the sisters. A government reformatory for youthful offenders is in charge of the Oblates, the number of boys varying from 150 to 200. About the same number of old people are provided with a home by the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> in Colombo. In the 397 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the archdiocese 35,520 children are <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>. Of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> 202 are for boys, with 20,826 pupils, and 195 for girls with 14,694 pupils. The management of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is entirely in the hands of the missionaries; but there is a government examination every year, on the results of which a grant is paid to the superintendent of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The archdiocese maintains for teachers of both sexes normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> recognized by the Government. Higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in English is provided for girls at the various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in Colombo, and for boys at St. Joseph's College (800 students) conducted by the Oblate Fathers. The training of aspirants for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is carried on in two <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>: the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Aloysius with 24 students and St. Bernard's <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 20 students. There are 9 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 1 for boys and 8 for girls, which provide <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for 673 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> (104 boys and 569 girls). Two papers, both bi-weekly are published at the Colombo <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press, the "Ceylon <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Messenger" in English, and the "Nanartha Pradipaya" in Cingalese. The management and editorial control of both papers are in the hands of the missionaries. A Cingalese monthly of a <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> is issued from the press of the boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. Colombo has conferences of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> and of the Ladies of Charity. The Bonjean Memorial Hall is the head-quarters of the Ceylon <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union, established in 1902, with branches in all the principal parts of the island. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Club was opened in 1900.
