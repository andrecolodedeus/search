<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Colonna</h1>  

<p>A celebrated <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which played an important r&ocirc;le in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> during <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> and <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> times, and which still flourishes in several branches in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. It is commonly supposed to have been originally an offshoot of the Counts of Tusculum, deriving the family name from the castle of Colonna situated on a spur of the Alban hills, some five miles from Tusculum. The name makes its first appearance in authentic history in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Petrus de Columna, owner of Colonna, Monte Porzio, and Zagarolo, and claimant of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, whose castles were seized by Paschal II, <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 1101, in punishment of his lawless depradations. With the destruction of Tusculum by the Romans in 1191, the name of the ancient counts disappears forever, whilst the Colonna come prominently to the front. From the first their policy was anti-papal and <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a>, not so much from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the emperors as from the desire to maintain towards the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> an attitude of quasi-independence. They exercised plenary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over their vassals in matters civil and criminal and frequently contracted alliances with foreign potentates without consulting the wishes or interests of their sovereign. They were in perpetual feud with their <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> neighbours, in particular with the rival house of the Orsini. They so frequently incurred the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> censures on account of their rebellious conduct, that it became the general but <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> opinion of the Roman people that they yearly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the Colonna was one of the main purposes of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "In C&aelig;na Domini". Nevertheless, members of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were quite often appointed by friendly pontiffs to high offices of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Rarely were they without at least one representative in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, and at one of the most critical junctures in the annals of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the election to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> of Cardinal Odo Colonna, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, put an end to the disastrous <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>. Twice in the course of its history this powerful house was threatened with annihilation (see <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">B<font size=-2>ONIFACE </font> VIII</a>; <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">A<font size=-2>LEXANDER</font> VI</a>), but on both occasions the restoration of its members was as speedy as their fall.

<p>The long line of Colonnese <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> was opened in 1192 when Giovanni the Elder was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of S. Prisca by <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a>. He was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sabina by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, and was employed on important legations to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was the powerful friend of St. Francis, and was largely instrumental in obtaining from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the approval of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Rule. He is remembered at <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> for his munificence in building and endowing a spacious <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. He died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1209. Three years later <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent</a> elevated to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> a nephew of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, known as Giovanni the Younger, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of S. Prassede. He was sent to the Orient as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in 1217 and returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1222 bringing with him the Pillar of the Scourging, which remains to the present day in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> he built for it in his titular church. He also built and endowed two <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> near the Lateran for the relief of the poor and of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. In 1240, after a futile attempt to reconcile <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, as head of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, together with the other <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, went over to the emperor and openly rebelled against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He died in 1245. <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a> (<em>ad. an.</em> 1244) describes him as "a vessel filled with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and insolence; who, as he was the most illustrious and powerful in secular possessions of all the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, was the most efficacious author and fosterer of discord between the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>".

<p>As a punishment of their Ghibellinism, no scion of the house was admitted into the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> until 1278, when the magnanimous Orsini <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, the son of that Matteo Rosso who had razed all the Colonna strongholds in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in token of amnesty elevated to the dignity of the purple Giacomo Colonna with the title of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of S. Maria in Via Lata. About ten years later, <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a> created Pietro, nephew of Giacomo, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of the Title of S. Eustachio. These were the two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> whose bitter quarrel with <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> ended so disastrously for that pontiff and for the prestige of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Deposed and degraded in 1297, they were reinstated in their dignities and possessions by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> in 1305. Both died at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, Giacomo in 1318, Pietro in 1326. These unruly <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> continued the deeply religious traditions of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, founding and endowing the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of S. Giacomo for incurables and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of S. Silvestro in Capite, in which they deposed the remains of the saintly sister of Giacomo, the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> Beata Margarita. Their munificence as patrons of art is attested by many masterpieces in the Roman churches, notably Turrita's <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> in S. Maria Maggiore, pronounced by Gregorovius "the finest work of all the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>". The learned Cardinal Egidio Colonna well deserves a special article (see <a href="../cathen/04127a.htm">C<font size=-2>OLONNA,</font> E<font size=-2>GIDIO</font></a>). One year after Pietro's death, his nephew Giovanni, a son of the noble Senator Stefano, whose immediate <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> remained faithful to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> during the troublous times of Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, whilst his kinsman Sciarra, led the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> party, was raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, with the title of S. Angelo. He was universally esteemed, especially by men of letters. He wrote the "Lives of the Roman Pontiffs from St. Peter to Boniface VIII". At his death, 1348, his intimate friend, <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, wrote the beautiful sonnet, "Rotta &#232; l'alta Colonna". At the beginning of the Great Schism <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban</a> created two Colonna <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, Agapito and Stefano, but they both died shortly after. Then followed Odo Colonna, later <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a>, who, in 1430 bestowed the purple upon his youthful nephew Prospero. The latter, becoming involved in the rebellion of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> against <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, was deprived of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and sentenced to perpetual exile, but was reinstated by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, and died in 1463, lauded by the Humanists as a M&aelig;cenas of arts and letters. In the heated <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1458 it was Prospero Colonna who decided the election of Piccolomini in the famous words, "I also vote for the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, and make him <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>".

<p>Prospero's nephew, Giovanni, was the representative of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> during the pontificates of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, <a href="../cathen/12128a.htm">Pius III</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. Created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of S. Maria in Aquiro in his twenty-fourth year by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Pope Sixtus</a>, he was committed to the Castle of Sant' Angelo two years later, when that pontiff and the Colonna began their bitter feud. After an <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of over a year, he regained his liberty. One cannot feel much sympathy with him in his misfortunes during the pontificate of the Borgia <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who could not have been elected without his vote. When <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> began his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of extermination against the Roman barons, Colonna, more fortunate than Cardinal Orsini, made his escape and did not return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> till the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had passed away. He himself died in 1508. Although <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> restored to the Colonna their possessions and dignities, and by the <em>Pax Romana,</em> 1511, put an end to the hereditary feuds of the rival houses, yet, their old-time position of quasi-independence was never again attained. The two secular heads of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, Prospero and Fabrizio, acquired great fame as generals in the armies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. Fabrizio's daughter was the highly gifted <a href="../cathen/04128b.htm">Vittoria</a>. Prospero's nephew, Pompeo, was chosen to represent the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He consented very reluctantly, for the sword was more congenial to him than the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. He received a large accumulation of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, in 1517, and vice-chancellor by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>. In return, he took the side of the emperor in his quarrel with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On 20 Sept., 1526, took place the onslaught on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> of St. Peter's and the Vatican, which covers his memory with eternal <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>. He also joined with Constable Bourbon in the capture of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, May, 1527; but, horrified by the brutality of the sack of his native city, he did his best to shield his unfortunate countrymen within the walls of the Cancellaria. The indulgent Clement absolved and reinstated him three years later. He became viceroy of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and died in 1532. The good name of the house was redeemed by the next Colonnese <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, Marcantonio, who was carefully trained in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, Felice Peretti, later <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. He was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of SS. XII Apostoli, in 1565, closely imitated <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> in establishing <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and restoring discipline, was librarian of the Vatican, fostered learning, and was extremely charitable to the poor. Before his death in 1597, his kinsman Ascanio Colonna was elevated to the purple by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> in 1586. Although he owed his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> largely to the favour of Philip II, yet he did not permit his gratitude to extinguish his patriotism. It was his defection from the Spanish ranks at a critical moment during the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1592 that defeated the aspirations of Philip's candidate, Cardinal Sanseverina and led to the election of <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>. In his well-known exclamation: "I see that God will not have Sanseverina, neither will Ascanio Colonna", breathes the haughty spirit of his race. He died in 1608, making the Lateran his heir. Succeeding <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the house of Colonna were Girolamo, created by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1628, d. 1666; Carlo, created by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> in 1706, d. 1739; Prospero, created by <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> in 1739, d. 1746; Girolamo, created by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> 1743, d. 1763; Prospero, of the Sciarra branch, created simultaneously with his kinsman in 1743, d. Prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> in 1765; finally, Marcantonio, created by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> in 1759, d. in 1803. Though all were conspicuous for learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and for filling high office at the Roman court or in the most important <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, they need only a passing notice. The most illustrious lay prince of the Colonna was Marcantonio, who at the great sea-fight of <a href="../cathen/09181b.htm">Lepanto</a>, 7 Oct., 1571, commanded the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> galleys and on his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was awarded a memorable triumph. To cement the friendship between the houses of Colonna and Orsini, <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> married their chiefs to his nieces and ordained that they and their descendants should enjoy the dignity of Assistant Princes at the Pontifical Throne.
