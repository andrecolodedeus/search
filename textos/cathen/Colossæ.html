<h1>Coloss&aelig;</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of Phrygia in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, suppressed in 1894. Little is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> about its history. The later name, Colass&aelig;, is probably the old Phrygian form. Coloss&aelig; was at one time the chief city of South-Western Phrygia, lying on the trade-route from Sardis to Cel&aelig;n&aelig; it produced fine wool, the colour of which was called <em>colossinus</em>. The ruin of the city was brought about by the change of road system, the foundation of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, eleven miles distant, and severe earthquakes. It retained municipal independence, but at the time of Strabo (XII, viii, 4) it was "a small town". It had its own <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> under the empire. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (probably about 61) addressed an epistle from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the inhabitants of Coloss&aelig;, who had perhaps been evangelized by him. Coloss&aelig; was the home of his companions, Archippus and Philemon of his very dear sister, Appia, and of Onesimus and Epaphras, who probably founded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Coloss&aelig;. The ruins of the city are visible near Chon&aelig;, in the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, on the left bank of the Lycus (Tehuruk Su); they include the acropolis, an aqueduct, theatre, etc. There is also a curious petrifying river, the Ak Su. Under the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> the territory of Coloss&aelig; rose again to importance, and a strong fortress was built (perhaps by Justinian) at Chon&aelig;, three miles south-southeast of Coloss&aelig;. The centre of population long remained at the old site, but about the eighth century it was moved to a shelf of land beneath the castle. Chon&aelig; (vulgar Greek Khon&eacute;s, Turk. Honas) is still a little village, twelve miles east of Denizli; it has been rendered famous by its <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Michael. Coloss&aelig; was a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> in Phrygia Pacatiana. Besides St. Epaphras, two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are mentioned: Epiphanius in 451 and Cosmas in 692; Archippus and Philemon, especially the latter, are very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. Chon&aelig; was made an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> about 858-60, and in some later <a href="../cathen/11124b.htm">"Notiti&aelig; episcopatuum"</a> appears as a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> without suffragans. Many titulars are known: Dositheus at Nic&aelig;, in 787; Samuel, a friend of Photius, who sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was present at the Council of Constantinople in 866; Constantine, in 1028; Nicholas, in 1066 and 1080; in 1143 Nicetas, the godfather of the historian <a href="../cathen/01239b.htm">Nicetas Acominatus</a>, who was born at Chon&aelig;, as was his brother Michael, the famous <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>.
