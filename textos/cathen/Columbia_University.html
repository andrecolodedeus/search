<h1>Columbia University</h1>  

<p>Portland, Oregon</p>

<p>Columbia University, formerly known as Portland University, is located on the east bank of the Willamette River in northern Portland, and is conducted by the Congregation of Holy Cross, whose mother-house is at Notre Dame, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>. In 1898 Portland University, conducted by a local <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodist</a> association, failed and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to close its doors. For three years the buildings were unoccupied. In 1901 the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> buildings and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of this institution were acquired by most Reverend Alexander Christie, D.D., <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> City. For one year the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, now called Columbia University, was conducted by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In 1902 Archbishop Christie appealed for teachers to Rev. J.A. Zahm, then <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the Congregation of Holy Cross, who at once sent some of his religious to take charge of the new institute. In 1909 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was incorporated under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, and empowered to teach collegiate and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> courses and to confer certificates, diplomas, honours, and degrees in the arts, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, philology, literature, history, mathematics, and other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> branches. To meet the need of a thorough preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the North-West an academic department was founded at Columbia. The first faculties organized were those of arts and letters and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Today, besides the college department and preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Columbia has chairs of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, history and economics, mathematics and languages. There have been three presidents of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Rev. E. P. Murphy, of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, was chosen as first president; Rev. Michael Quinlan, C.S.C., and Rev. Joseph Gallagher, C.S.C., were his successors. At present (1912) about two hundred students are registered. The faculties are made up of twenty professors including a few <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. The erection of Christie Hall, recently, has made accommodations for an additional one hundred and fifty students.
