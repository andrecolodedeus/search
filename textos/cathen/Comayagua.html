<h1>Comayagua</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of Comayagua, suffragan to <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, includes the entire Republic of <a href="../cathen/07449b.htm">Honduras</a> in Central America, a territory of about 46,250 square miles, and a population (1902), exclusive of uncivilized Indians, of 684,400, mostly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It also includes a group of islets in the Bay of Honduras (Ruatan, Bonacca, Utila, Barbareta, and Moret). The surface is mountainous, with many fertile plains and plateaux. Communication is difficult, as there are few good roads, but a railroad from Puerto Cortez to La Pimienta (sixty miles) is destined to reach the Pacific. The mineral wealth is great, and the trade in bananas very lucrative. The climate in the interior is usually healthy, but fevers are frequent along the low coast. The capital of the State, Tegucigalpa, has 17,000 inhabitants. The first missionaries were <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, though the records of their labours have disappeared in the disastrous conflagrations that the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the nineteenth century visited on Comayagua, and in which the archives of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> perished. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was established in 1527 by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, and confirmed in 1539 by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>. It is supposed that Bishop Pedrasa, who went in that year to <a href="../cathen/15070b.htm">Trujillo</a>, was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Under the fourth, Jeronimo de Corella, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> transferred (1561) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Nueva Valladolid, now Comayagua. The prosperous missions among the savage Indians on the north coast were broken up in 1601 by English pirates; colonists and missionaries were scattered, and the Indians (now about 90,000) relapsed into their original savagery. The revolution of 1821 did great damage to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Before that time there were more than 300 <a href="../cathen/06157b.htm">ecclesiastical foundations</a>, and public worship was everywhere carried on with dignity. The revolutionary Government confiscated the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> to the value of more than a million pesos, according to a presidential message of 1842. Since then <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> depended for public worship on precarious <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> diminished in number. Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> were still paid to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and from them the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> services, and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> were supported. The latter was open only to externs and only the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> were taught; <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and young men destined for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> were <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> there together.

<p>Between 1878 and 1880 the new president of <a href="../cathen/07449b.htm">Honduras</a>, imposed by <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, confiscated anew the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> resources put together by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> properties, residences of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and churches, abolished the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and, to complete the ruin of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order, suppressed in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> the courses of canon law and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, and in the colleges even the study of Latin. These oppressive acts hampered greatly the proper formation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, public worship, and the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Lately the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> has been reopened, but despite the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> the former is subject to many restrictions. The civil government is no longer hostile, but in its name provincial and local authorities exhibit no little hostility to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The episcopal city, which has 8000 inhabitants, suffered much from the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the period of federation (1823-39) and has never regained its former size or prosperity. Bishop Joseph Maria Martinez Cabanas (1908) is the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth of the line. The five <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Department of Comayagua represent the former <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons, and assist the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on occasions; at his death they elect the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>. There are seventy <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and no regulars; the Government has never tolerated the return of the latter since their expulsion (1821). There is a missionary on the northern coast and at Comayagua a <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesian</a> Father. The wealthier classes of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, with very few exceptions, are indifferent to religion. There are no <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, as the people of the pueblos are unable to support them, after paying taxes for the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; moreover the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are unable to conduct them, being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> at all times to move about from one small town to another and among the widely scattered villages and the mountains. (See <a href="../cathen/07449b.htm">HONDURAS</a>; GUATEMALA.)
