<h1>Commandments of the Church</h1>  

<p>We shall consider: <blockquote> I. The nature of the Commandments of the Church in general; <br>II. The history of the Commandments of the Church; <br>III. Their classification. </blockquote>
<h2 id="section1">Nature of these commandments</h2>

<p>The authority to enact <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on all the faithful belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the very nature of her constitution. Entrusted with the original deposit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> revelation, she is the appointed public organ and interpreter of that revelation for all time. For the effective discharge of her high office, she must be empowered to give to her <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the gravest sanction. These <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> when they bind universally, have for their object: <ul><li>the definition or explanation of some <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, either by way of positive pronouncement or by the condemnation of opposing <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; <li>the prescription of the time and manner in which a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, more or less general and indeterminate, is to be observed, e.g. the precept <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> during the paschal season and to confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> annually; <li>the defining of the sense of the moral law in its application to difficult cases of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, e.g. many of the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>; <li>some matter of mere discipline serving to safeguard the observance of the higher law, e.g. the Commandments to contribute to the support of one's <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> (Vacant, Dict. de theol. cath., s.v.).</ul> All these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> when binding on the faithful universally are truly commandments of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the technical sense, however, the table of these Commandments does not contain <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> pronouncements. Such an inclusion would render it too complex. The Commandments of the Church (in this restricted sense) are moral and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, and as a particular code of <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> are necessarily broad in character and limited in number.
<h2 id="section2">History of the commandments</h2>

<p>We outline here only in a general way the history of the form and number of the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The discussion of the content of the several Commandments and of the penalties imposed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for violation of these Commandments will be found under the various subjects to which they refer. We do not find in the early <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> any fixed and formal body of Church Commandments. As early, however, as the time of Constantine, especial insistence was put upon the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to hear Mass on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Holy Days, to receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and to abstain from contracting marriage at certain seasons. In the seventh-century Penitentiary of <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">Theodore of Canterbury</a> we find penalties imposed on those who contemn the Sunday and fail to keep the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as well as legislation regarding the reception of the Eucharist; but no reference is here made to any <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> accepted in a particular sense. Neither do we discover such special reference in one of the short sermons addressed to <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> and attributed to <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, but probably of later date, in which the hearers are urged to observe Sunday, pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, observe the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, and receive at times the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. In German books of popular instruction and devotion from the ninth century onwards special emphasis was laid on the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to discharge these <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Particularly does this appear in the forms prepared for the <a href="../cathen/05675a.htm">examination of conscience</a>. According to a work written at this time by Regino, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Pr&uuml;m (d. 915), entitled "Libri duo de synodalibus causis et disciplinis", the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his visitation is, among other inquiries, to ask <blockquote> if anyone has not kept the fast of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, or of the ember-days, or of the rogations, or that which may have been appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the staying of any plague; if there be any one who has not gone to <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> three time in the year, that is at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, Pentecost and <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>; if there be any one who has withheld <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; if there be anyone so perverse and so alienated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as not to come to Church at least on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>; if there be anyone who has not gone to confession once in the year, that is at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and has not done penance for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (Hafner, Zur Geschichte der Kirchengebote, in Theologische Quartalschrift, LXXX, 104). </blockquote>

<p>The insistence on the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> here implied, and the fact that they were almost invariably grouped together in the books already referred to, had the inevitable effect of giving them a distinct character. They came to be regarded as special Commandments of the Church. Thus in a book of tracts of the thirteenth century attributed to <a href="../cathen/03479b.htm">Celestine V</a> (though the authenticity of this work has been denied) a separate tractate is given to the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and is divided into four chapters, the first of which treats of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, the second of confession and paschal Communion, the third of <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicts</a> on marriage, and the fourth of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. In the fourteenth century Ernest von Parduvitz, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, instructed his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to explain in popular sermons the principal points of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a>, the Creed, the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">Commandments of God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Hafner, loc. cit., 115). A century later (1470) the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> of Dietrick Coelde, the first, it is said, to be written in German, explicitly set forth that there were five Commandments of the Church. In his "Summa Theologica" (part I, tit. xvii, p. 12) <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> of Florence (1439) enumerates ten <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> universally binding on the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. These are: to observe certain feasts, to keep the prescribed <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, to attend Mass on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Holy Days, to confess once a year, to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> during <a href="../cathen/05524d.htm">paschal time</a>, to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, to abstain from any act upon which an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> has been placed entailing <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, to refrain also from any act <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicted</a> under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> <em>lat&aelig; sententi&aelig;</em>, to avoid association with the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, finally not to attend Mass or other religious functions celebrated by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> living in open <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>. In the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> canonist, <a href="../cathen/01793b.htm">Martin Aspilcueta</a> (1586), gives a list of five principal <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, to fast at certain prescribed times, to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, to go to confession once a year and to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (Enchiridion, sive manuale confessariorum et poenitentium, Rome, 1588, ch. xxi, n. 1). At this time, owing to the prevalence of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, there appeared many popular works in defence of the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and setting forth in a special manner her <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>. Such among others were the "Summa Doctrin&aelig; Christian&aelig;" (1555) of St. Peter Canisius and the "Doctrina Christiana" of <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (1589). It is plain, however, that the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as a particular and distinct body of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were recognized long before the sixteenth century; the contention that they were first definitely formulated by St. Peter Canisius is unwarranted.
<h2 id="section3">Classification</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in her supreme authority has defined nothing regarding the form and number of the Commandments of the Church. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> while recommending in a general way in its twenty-fifth session the observance of these <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> says nothing regarding them as a particular body of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Neither is any specific mention made of them in the "Catechismus ad parochos" published by order of the council and known as the <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">"Catechism of the Council of Trent"</a> or <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">"Roman Catechism"</a>. We have seen that <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> of Florence enumerates ten such commandments while <a href="../cathen/01793b.htm">Martin Aspilcueta</a> mentions only five. This last number is that given by St. Peter Canisius. According to this author the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are: To observe the feast days appointed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; to hear Mass reverently on these feast days; to observe the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> on the days during the seasons appointed; to confess to one's <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> annually; to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> at least once a year and that around the feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. Owing undoubtedly to the influence of Canisius, the catechisms generally used at present throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> have adopted the above enumeration. The fourth precept has, however, been amended so as to allow of confession being made to any duly authorized <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p>In Spanish America the number of church <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> is also five; this being the number as we have seen, set down by <a href="../cathen/01793b.htm">Aspilcueta</a> in the sixteenth century. Here, however, the First and Second commandment in the table of Canisius are combined into one, and the precept to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> appears. It is to be noted, also, that the precept of annual confession is more specific; it enjoins that this confession be made in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, or before, if there be danger of death. (Synod of Mexico, 1585, Lib. I, tit. i, in <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a>, Conc., X, 1596.) French and Italian catechists reckon six <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the church, the enumeration given by <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>. According to this writer the Commandments of the Church are: To hear Mass on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Holy Days; to fast during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, on prescribed vigils, and the ember-days; to abstain from meat on Fridays and Saturdays; to go to confession once a year; to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>; to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>; and finally not to solemnize marriage during the prohibited times.

<p>The French catechisms, following that of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, omit the last two <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, but retain the same number as that given by <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>. This they do by making two Commandments cover the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to observe Sunday and the Holy Days, and two also regarding the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of fast and abstinence. It will be readily observed that the omission by French writers of the Commandment to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> was owing to local conditions. In a "Catechism of Christian Doctrine" approved by <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, six Commandments of the Church are enumerated. These are: <ul><li>to keep the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Holy Days of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> holy, by hearing <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and resting from servile work; <li>to keep the days of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and abstinence appointed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; <li>to go to confession at least once a year; <li>to receive the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> at least once a year and that at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> or thereabouts; <li>to contribute to the support of our <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>; <li>not to marry within a certain degree of kindred nor to solemnize marriage at the forbidden times.</ul> This list is the same as that which the Fathers of the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1886) prescribed for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
