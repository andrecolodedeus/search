<h1>Commemoration of the Passion of Christ</h1>  

<p>A feast kept on the Tuesday after <a href="../cathen/13747a.htm">Sexagesima</a>. Its object is the devout remembrance and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's sufferings</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Whilst the feast in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the instruments of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a> &#151; the Holy Cross, Lance, Nails, and Crown of Thorns &#151; called "Arma Christi", originated during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, this commemoration is of more recent origin. It appears for the first time in the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> (1517) as a <em>festum simplex</em> for 15 Nov. The same <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> has a feast of the Holy Face for 15 Jan and of the Holy Name for 15 March [Grotefend, "(Zeitrechnung" (Hanover, 1892), II, 118 sqq.]. These feasts disappeared with the introduction of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. As found in the appendix of the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, it was initiated by <a href="../cathen/11590a.htm">St. Paul of the Cross</a> (d. 1775). The Office was composed by Thomas Struzzieri, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a>, and the faithful associate of St. Paul. This Office and the corresponding feast were approved by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> (1775-99) for the Discalced Clerics of the Holy Cross and the Passion of Christ (commonly called <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>), founded by <a href="../cathen/11590a.htm">St. Paul of the Cross</a>. The feast is celebrated by them as a double of the first class with an octave (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, "Kal. man.", II, 69). At the same time <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> approved the other Offices and feasts of the Mysteries of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Passion</a>: the feast of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> of Our Lord in the Garden (Tuesday after <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a>); the Crown of Thorns (Friday after <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash-Wednesday</a>); the Holy Lance and Nails (Friday after the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>); and for the following Fridays: the feasts of the Holy Winding Sheet, the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">Five Wounds</a>, and the Precious Blood of Christ (cf. appendix to Roman Brev.). These feasts were, at least in part, readily adopted by many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Most of them are found in the <em>proprium</em> of <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a> (a. 1798), as also is the feast of the Passion (a double of the first class with an octave). This latter feast is celebrated with an octave in all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the former <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>. On 30 Aug., 1809, the privilege of the feast (double major) was granted to the <a href="../cathen/09131a.htm">Diocese of Leghorn</a> for the Friday before <a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Passion Sunday</a>. In the old St. Louis Ordo (1824) it was assigned to Friday after <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash-Wednesday</a>, which day it still retains in the Baltimore Ordo. The seven Offices of the Mysteries of the Passion of Christ were adopted by the City of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1831 (Corresp. de <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1848, p. 30) and since then all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> that have the feast of the Passion of Christ in their calendar keep it on the Tuesday after <a href="../cathen/13747a.htm">Sexagesima</a>. By permission of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (8 May, 1884) the octave in the calendar of the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a> is privileged and admits only feasts of the first and second class. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 5 July, 1883, the <a href="../cathen/15510a.htm">votive Office</a> of the Passion of Christ may be said every Friday which is not taken up by a semi-double or a double Office, except during the period from <a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Passion Sunday</a> to <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a> and from 18 December to 13 January. The Office composed by Struzzieri is very rich and full of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sentiment; the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, however, are rather modern.
