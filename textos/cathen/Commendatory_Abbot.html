<h1>Commendatory Abbot</h1>  

<p>An ecclesiastic, or sometimes a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, who holds an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/07719a.htm"><em>in commendam,</em></a> that is, who draws its revenues and, if an ecclesiastic, may also have some <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but does not exercise any authority over its inner monastic discipline. Originally only vacant <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, or such as were temporarily without an actual superior, were given in commendam, in the latter case only until an actual superior was elected or appointed. An <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> is held <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>, i.e. provisorily, in distinction to one held <em>in titulum</em>, which is a permanent <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>.

<p>As early as the time of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a> (590-604) vacant <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were given in commendam to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been driven from their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> by the invading barbarians. The practice began to be seriously abused in the eighth century when the Anglo-Saxon and <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kings assumed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to set commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> over <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that were occupied by <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. Often these commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, vassals of the kings, or others who were authorized to draw the revenues and manage the temporal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in reward for military services. While the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> Marozia was influential in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and during the reigns of Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Philip I of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, William the Conqueror, William Rufus, Henry I and II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the abuse reached its climax. The most worthless <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were often made commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, who in many cases brought about the temporal and spiritual ruin of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. When in 1122 the dispute concerning investiture was settled in favour of the church, the appointment of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> as commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and many other abuses were abolished. The abuses again increased while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> resided at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> (1309-1377) and especially during the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (1378-1417), when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, as well as the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a>, gave numerous <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in commendam in order to increase the number of their adherents.

<p>After the eighth century various attempts were made by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and councils to regulate the appointment of commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. Still, the abuses continued. <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (1294-1303) decreed that a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> attached should be granted in commendam only in great necessity or when evident advantage would accrue to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but never for more than six months (c. 15, VI, De elect., 1, 6). <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (1305-14) revoked <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> which had been granted by him in commendam at an earlier date (Extr. comm., c. 2, De praeb., 3, 2). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV, cap. xxi, de Regularibus) determined that vacant <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> should be bestowed only on <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and virtuous regulars, and that the principal or motherhouse of an order and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> founded immediately therefrom should no longer be granted in commendam. The succeeding <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Superna" of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, and the Constitution "Pastoralis" of <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> greatly checked the abuses, but did not abolish them entirely. Especially in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> they continued to flourish to the detriment of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and the general secularization of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the beginning of the eighteenth century destroyed the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with the good. Since that time commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> have become very rare, and the former abuses have been abolished by wise regulations. There are still a few commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> among the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>; <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> himself was Commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>The powers of a commendatory abbot are as follows: If the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is occupied by a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community where there is a separate <em>mensa abbatialis</em>, i.e. where the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> have each a separate income, the commendatory abbot, who must then be an ecclesiastic, has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> <em>in foro externo</em> over the members of the community and enjoys all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of an actual <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and if, as is generally the case, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> has a special superior, he is subject to the commendatory abbot as a claustral prior is subject to his actual <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. If there is no separate <em>mensa abbatialis</em>, the power of the commendatory abbot extends only over the temporal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In case of vacant <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the commendatory abbot generally has all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of an actual <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>.
