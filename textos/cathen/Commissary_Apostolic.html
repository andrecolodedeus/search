<h1>Commissary Apostolic</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Commissarius Apostolicus</em>)

<p>A commissary  is one who has received power from a Legitimate superior authority to pass judgment in a certain cause or to take informations concerning it. When such a delegate has been appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he is called a commissary Apostolic.

<p>The custom of appointing such commissaries by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is a very ancient one. A noteworthy instance is the commission issued to St. Cryil of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> by <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Pope Celestine I</a>, in the early part of the fifth Century, by which that holy patriarch was empowered to judge Nestorius in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name. English history furnishes, among other instances, that of the commission which constituted <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> and <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Campeggio</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> representatives for the judicial hearing of the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> case of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. Sometimes Apostolic commissions are constituted permanently by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Such are the various <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a> presided over by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The full extent of the authority of commissaries Apostolic must be learnt from the diploma of their appointment. The usual powers which they possess, however, are defined in the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Commissaries are empowered not only for judicial but also for executive purposes. When a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commission mentions explicitly certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and certain things as subject to the authority of a commissary, and then adds in general that "other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and other things" (<em>quidam alii et res ali&oelig;</em>) are also included, it is understood that the latter phrase refers only to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and things of equal or lower importance than those that are expressly named, and under no circumstances can the commissary's power extend to what is higher or more dignified (Cap. xv, de <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a>.). If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be appointed commissary Apostolic in matters that already belong to his ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, he does not thereby receive a delegated <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> superadded to that which he already possessed; such an Apostolic commission is said to excite, not to alter, the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate's</a> ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.

<p>As a commissary Apostolic is a delegate of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, an appeal may be made to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against his judgments or administrative acts. When several commissaries have been appointed for the same case, they are to act together as one; but if, owing to death or any other cause, one or other of the commissaries should be hindered from acting, the remaining members have full power to execute their commission. In case the commissaries be two in number and they disagree in the judgment to be given, the matter must be decided by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. A commissary Apostolic has the power to subdelegate another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for the cause committed to him, unless it has been expressly stated in his diploma that, owing to the importance of the matter at issue, he is to exercise <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> personally. By the plenitude of his power, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> can constitute a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> commissary Apostolic for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, but according to the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> only <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of the higher orders should receive such a commission (Lib. Sext., c. II, de rescr., 1, 3). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV, c. xvi, de Ref.) prescribes that each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should transmit to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the names of four <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> capable of receiving such delegation for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. It has consequently become customary for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to choose commissaries Apostolic from the locality where they are to investigate or pass judgment or execute a mandate.
