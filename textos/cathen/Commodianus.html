<h1>Commodianus</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poet, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of whose birth is uncertain, but generally placed at about the middle of the third century, or between the end of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian's</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and the issuing of the edict of <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a> (305-11). It has lately been asserted, however, that Commodianus lived under <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> or even in the middle of the fifth century. He is not known outside of his own writings except through a notice by <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a>, "De Viris Illustribus" (ch. xv), and the condemnation of Pseudo-Gelasius, who prohibits the reading of his books ("De Libris recipiendis et non recipiendis", in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LIX, 163) <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a> seems to draw his information chiefly from the works themselves, and claims that Commodianus imitated <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, Lactantius, and Papias. From two passages in his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> it was gleaned that Commodianus came from <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> in Palestine and had been invested with the episcopal dignity, but the first of these passages has a very uncertain meaning, and the second has been attributed to the mistake of a copyist. Commodianus declares that he is not a "doctor", which has led to the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that he was a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. He styles himself "mendicant of Christ", <em>mendicus Christi</em>, but that could also mean "one who implores Christ" or "one who begs for Christ". What is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, is that, after various religious experiences, such as associating with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and practising the occult <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and probably conforming to the religious doctrines and rites of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he adopted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, having been converted by reading the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>.

<p>His works are a collection of "Instructions" and a "Carmen apologeticum". The former consists of eighty acrostic, or abecedarian, essays, divided into two books. The plan of this work and the Biblical quotations introduced therein reveal the influence of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> "Testimonia". The first book is against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, the second being addressed to different categories of the faithful: <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, penitents, <em>matrones</em>, clerks, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In parts its tone is decidedly satirical. The author is manifestly engrossed with ethics, and recommends alms-deeds above all else. The "Carmen apologeticum" has a misleading title, thanks to Pitra, its first editor (1852). It may be divided into four parts: a preamble (1-88); a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ (89-578); a demonstration of the necessity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (379-790); and a description of the end of the world (791-1060). It is principally this picture that has made the name of Commodianus famous. According to it the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are a prey to a seventh <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> &mdash; the number is symbolical and indicates the last <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> surprise and destroy <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Suddenly <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> of the West, reappears, recaptures <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, associates himself with two C&aelig;sars and maltreats the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for three and a half years. Then a second <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, the man from <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, comes from the East, conquers <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, burns <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, establishes himself in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and works wonders. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with an army of the blessed. advances from beyond <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> in a triumphal march; <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is overcome, and Christ and His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> settle in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. To learn what follows we must consult the "Instructions" (II, 1-4). First of all the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> rise from the dead and for 1000 years lead lives of pleasure and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. At the end of that time the world is destroyed by fire, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appears, and all the dead arise for the Last Judgment, which leads either to the joys of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a> or the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>.

<p>The sources of Commodianus's information were the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> &mdash; principally the Apocalypse, the Prophets, and the Fourth Book of Esdras &mdash; the Sibylline oracles, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a>, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, and Lactantius. From Terence, Lucretius, Horace, Cicero, and most of all from Virgil, he borrows modes of expression. His <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is not reliable; besides Millenarianism, he seems to profess <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchianism</a> and Patripassianism, two <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> in regard to the Trinity. His language is not only crude, but incorrect, and it would be a mistake to seek in Commodianus the origin of versification based on accent. Although unacquainted with prosody, he tries to write in dactylic hexameter, and succeeds in only 63 out of more than 2000 verses. However, his shortcomings are somewhat atoned for by his use of parallelism, rhyme, and the acrostic, and the regular division of his verses; moreover, in spite of its defects, his work is decidedly energetic. He has well-defined formul&aelig;, he conjures up magnificent pictures, and among the many artists and writers who have attempted a portrayal of the end of the world, Commodianus occupies a prominent place. His works have been edited by Ludwig (Leipzig, 1877-78) and by Dombart (Vienna, 1877, in "Corpus scriptorum eccles. latinorum", XV). The poem against Marcio, attributed by some critics to Commodianus, is the work of an imitator.
