<h1>Communicatio Idiomatum</h1>  

<p>("Communication of Idioms").

<p>A technical expression in the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. It means that the properties of the Divine Word can be ascribed to the man Christ, and that the properties of the man Christ can be predicated of the Word. The language of Scripture and of the Fathers shows that such a mutual interexchange of predicates is legitimate; in this article its source and the rules determining its use will be briefly considered.
<h2 id="section1">Source</h2>

<p>The source of the communicatio idiomatum is not to be found in the close moral union between Christ and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as maintained by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, nor in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> fullness of grace and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a>, nor, again, in the fact that the Word owns the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Christ by right of creation. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> have the same right and interest as the Son in all created things except in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. This the Son by Assumption has made His own in a way that is not theirs, i.e., by the incommunicable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of personal union. In Christ there is one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> with two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, the human and the Divine. In ordinary language all the properties of a subject are predicated of its <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; consequently the properties of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> two natures must be predicated of his one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, since they have only one subject of predication. He Who is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> on account of His eternal generation is also the subject of human properties; and He Who is the man Christ on account of having assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the subject of <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>. Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is man.
<h2 id="section2">Use</h2>

<p>The communicatio idiomatum is based on the oneness of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> subsisting in the two natures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Hence it can be used as long as both the subject and the predicate of a sentence stand for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, or present a common subject of predication. For in this case we simply affirm that He Who subsists in the Divine nature and possesses certain Divine properties is the same as He Who subsists in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and possesses certain human properties. The following considerations will show the application of this principle more in detail:

<p>(1) In general, concrete terms stand for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>: hence, statements interchanging the Divine and human properties of Christ are, generally speaking, correct if both their subjects and predicates be concrete terms. We may safely say, "God is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>", though we must observer certain cautions: <ul><li>The concrete human names of Christ describe His <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. They presuppose the Incarnation, and their application to Christ previously to the completion of the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> would involve the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> view that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> had its own subsistence. Consequently, such expressions as "man became <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" are to be avoided. <li>Concrete terms used reduplicatively emphasize the nature rather than the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The statement "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has suffered" means that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> according to His Divine nature has suffered; needless to say, such statements are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. <li>Certain expressions, though correct in themselves, are for extrinsic reasons, inadmissible; the statement "One of the Trinity was crucified" was misapplied in a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> sense and was therefore forbidden by Pope Hormisdas; the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> misinterpreted the words "Christ is a creature"; both <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> misused the expressions "Christ had a beginning" and "Christ is less than the Father" or "less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>"; the Docetists abused the terms "incorporeal" and "impassible". </ul> (2) Abstract terms generally stand for their respective nature. Now in Christ there are two natures. Hence statements interchanging the Divine and human properties of Christ are, generally speaking, incorrect if their subject and predicate, either one or both, be abstract terms. We cannot say "the Divinity is mortal", or, "the humanity is increated". The following cautions, however, must be added: <ul><li>Aside from the personal relations in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is no real distinction admissible in Him. Hence abstract names and <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">attributes of God</a>, though standing formally for the Divine nature, imply really also the Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Absolutely speaking, we may replace a concrete Divine name by its corresponding abstract one and still keep the communication idiomatum. Thus we may say "Omnipotence was crucified", in the sense that He Who is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> (<a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">Omnipotence</a>) is the same as He Who was crucified. But such expressions are liable to be misunderstood and great care must be exercised in their use. <li>There is less danger in the use of those abstract terms which express attributes appropriated to the Second <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Trinity. We may say "Eternal Wisdom became man". <li>There is no communicatio idiomatum between the two natures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or between the Word and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as such or its parts. The fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15117a.htm">Ubiquitists</a> consists in predicating of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or of humanity the properties of the Divine nature. We cannot say that "the Word is the humanity", and still less that "the Word is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>" or "the body of Christ". </ul> (3) In statements which interchange the Divine and the human properties of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, care must be taken not to deny or destroy one of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> natures or its properties. This is apt to be done: <ul><li>In negative sentences: though it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that Christ did not die according to His Divine nature, we cannot say, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not die", without impairing His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; <li>in exclusive sentences: if we say "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" or "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>", we destroy either His human or His Divine nature; <li>in the use of ambiguous terms: the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, and the Adoptionists misused the term "servant", inferring from the expression, "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", conclusions agreeing with their respective <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.</ul> (For the use of the communicatio idiomatum in a wider sense, i.e. as applied to the Body of Christ and the Sacramental Species, see <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">EUCHARIST</a>. See also <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">INCARNATION</a>; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">JESUS CHRIST</a>.)
