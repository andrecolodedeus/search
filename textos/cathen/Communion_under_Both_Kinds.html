<h1>Communion under Both Kinds</h1>  

<p>Communion under one kind is the reception of the Sacrament of the Eucharist under the species or appearance of bread alone, or of wine alone, Communion under two or both kinds, the distinct reception under the two or both species, <em>sub utraque specie</em>, at the same time. In the present article we shall treat the subject under the following heads: <blockquote> I. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Doctrine and Modern Discipline; <br>II. History of Disciplinary Variations; <br>III. Theological Speculation. </blockquote>
<h2 id="section1">Catholic doctrine and modern discipline</h2>

<p>(1) Under this head the following points are to be noted: (a) In reference to the Eucharist as a sacrifice, the communion, under both kinds, of the celebrating <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> belongs at least to the integrity, and, according to some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, to the essence, of the sacrificial rite, and may not therefore be omitted without violating the sacrificial precept of Christ: "Do this for a commemoration of me" (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs19">Luke 22:19</a>). This is taught implicitly by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXI, c. i; XXII, c. i). (b) There is no Divine precept binding the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> or non-celebrating <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to receive the sacrament under both kinds (Trent, sess. XXI, c. i.) (c) By reason of the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> and of the indivisibility of His glorified humanity, Christ is <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">really present</a> and is received whole and entire, body and blood, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and Divinity, under either species alone; nor, as regards the fruits of the sacrament, is the communicant under one kind deprived of any grace <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (Trent, Sess. XXI, c., iii). (d) In reference to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> generally, apart from their substance, <em>salva eorum substantia</em>, i.e. apart from what has been strictly determined by Divine institution or precept, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has authority to determine or modify the rites and usages employed in their administration, according as she judges it expedient for the greater profit of the recipients or the better protections of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> themselves against irreverence. Hence "although the usage of Communion under two kinds was not infrequent in the early ages [<em>ab initio</em>] of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, yet, the custom in this respect having changed almost universally [<em>latissime</em>] in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, holy mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, mindful of her authority in the administration of the Sacraments, and influenced by weighty and just reasons, has approved the custom of communicating under one kind, and decreed it to have the force of a law, which may not be set aside or changed but by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> own authority" (Trent, Sess. XXI, c. ii). Not only, therefore, is Communion under both kinds not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is strictly forbidden by ecclesiastical law to any but the celebrating <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. These decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> were directed against the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> of the sixteenth century, who, on the strength of <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs54">John 6:54</a>, <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs27">Matthew 26:27</a>, and <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs17">Luke 22:17-19</a>, enforced in most cases by a denial of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, maintained the existence of a Divine precept <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to receive under both kinds, and denounced the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> practice of withholding the cup from the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> as a sacrilegious mutilation of the sacrament. A century earlier the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, particularly the party of the Calixtines, had asserted the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, without denying, however, the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> or the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, and on the strength principally of <a href="../bible/joh006.htm">John 6:54</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> in its thirteenth session (1415) had already condemned their position and affirmed the binding force of the existing discipline in terms practically identical with those of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> approved by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, 1418, in <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion, n. 585). It is to be observed that neither council introduced any new legislation on the subject; both were content with declaring that the existing custom had already acquired the force of law. A few privileged exceptions to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and a few instances of express <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, occurring later, will be noticed below (II).

<p>(2) Regarding the merits of the Utraquist controversy, if we assume the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> points involved &#151; viz. the absence of a Divine precept imposing Communion under both kinds, the integral presence and reception of Christ under either species, and the discretionary power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> over everything connected with the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> that is not divinely determined the question of giving or refusing the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> becomes purely practical and disciplinary, and is to be decided by a reference to the two fold purpose to be attained, of safeguarding the reverence due to this most august sacrament and of facilitating and encouraging its frequent and fervent reception. Nor can it be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that the modern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> discipline best secures these ends. The danger of spilling the Precious Blood and of other forms of irreverence; the inconvenience and delay in administering the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> to large numbers &#151; the difficulty of reservation for Communion outside of Mass: the not unreasonable objection on hygienic and other grounds, to promiscuous drinking from the same <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, which of itself alone would act as a strong deterrent to frequent Communion in the case of a great many otherwise well-disposed people; these and similar "weighty and just reasons" against the Utraquist practice are more than sufficient to justify the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in forbidding it. Of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> points mentioned above, the only one that need be discussed here is the question of the existence or non-existence of a Divine precept imposing Communion <em>sub utraque.</em> Of the texts brought forward by Utraquists in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of such a precept, the command, "Drink ye all of this" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs27">Matthew 26:27</a>), and its equivalent in St. Luke (xxii, 17, i.e. supposing the reference here to be to the Eucharistic and not to the paschal cup), cannot fairly be held to apply to any but those present those on the occasion, and to them only for that particular occasion. Were one to insist that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> action in administering <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> under both kinds to the Apostles at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> was intended to lay down a law for all future recipients, he should for the same reason insist that several other temporary and accidental circumstances connected with the first celebration of the Eucharist (e.g. the preceding paschal rites, the use of unleavened bread, the taking of the Sacred Species by the recipients themselves) were likewise intended to be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> for all future celebrations. The institution under both kinds, or the separate <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, belongs essentially, in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opinion, to the sacrificial, as distinct from the sacramental, character of the Eucharist; and when Christ in the words "Do this for a commemoration of me" (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs19">Luke 22:19</a>), gave to the Apostles both the command and the power to offer the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Eucharistic sacrifice</a>, they understood Him merely to impose upon them and their successors in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of sacrificing <em>sub utraque.</em> This <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has rigorously observed.



<p>In <a href="../bible/joh006.htm">John 6:54</a>, Christ says: "Except you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you" but in verses 52 and 59 he attributes life eternal to the eating of "this bread" (which is "my flesh for the life of the world", without mention of the drinking of His blood: "if anyone eat of this bread he shall live forever". Now the Utraquist interpretation would suppose that in verse 54 Christ meant to emphasize the distinction between the mode of reception "by eating" and the mode of reception "by drinking", and to include both modes distinctly in the precept He imposes. But such literalism, extravagant in any connection, would result in this case in putting verse 54 in opposition to 52 and 59, interpreted in the same rigid way. From which we may infer that whatever special significance attached to the form of expression employed in verse 54, Christ did not have recourse to that form for the purpose of <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> a law of Communion <em>sub utraque.</em> The twofold expression is employed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in order to heighten the realism of the promise &#151; to emphasize more vividly the reality of the Eucharistic presence, and to convey the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that His Body and Blood were to be the perfect spiritual aliment, the food and drink, of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> on the Eucharist this meaning is fully verified. Christ is really and integrally received under either kind; and from the sacramental point of view it is altogether immaterial whether this perfect reception takes place after the analogy in the natural order of solid or of liquid food alone, or after the analogy of both combined (cf. III below). In <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs28">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>, to which Utraquists sometimes appeal, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is concerned with the preparation required for a worthy reception of the Eucharist. His mention of both species, "the bread and chalice", is merely incidental, and implies nothing more than the bare fact that Communion under both kinds was the prevailing usage in Apostolic times. From the verse immediately preceding (27) a difficulty might be raised against the dogmatic presuppositions of the great majority of Utraquists, and an argument advanced in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of the integral presence and reception of Christ under either species. "Whosoever", says the Apostle, "shall eat this bread or drink the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord" i.e. whoever receives <em>either</em> unworthily is guilty of <em>both</em>. But it is unnecessary to insist on this argument in defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position. We are justified in concluding that the N.T. contains no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the existence of a Divine precept binding the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to Communicate under both kinds. It will appear, further, from the following historical survey, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never recognized the existence of such a precept.
<h2 id="section2">History of disciplinary variations</h2>
<h3>From the first to the twelfth century</h3>

<p>It may be stated as a general fact, that down to the twelfth century, in the West as well as in the East, public Communion in the churches was ordinarily administered and received under both kinds. That such was the practice in Apostolic times is implied in <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs28">1 Corinthians 11:28</a> (see above), nor does the abbreviated reference to the "breaking of bread" in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> (ii, 46) prove anything to the contrary. The witness to the same effect for the sub-Apostolic and subsequent ages are too numerous, and the fact itself too clearly beyond dispute, to require that the evidence should be cited here. But side by side with the regular <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> usage of Communion <em>sub utraque</em>, there existed from the earlist times the custom of communicating in certain cases under one kind alone. This custom is exemplified (1) in the not infrequent practice of private domestic Communion, portion of the Eucharistic bread being brought by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to their homes and there reserved for this purpose; (2) in the Communion of the sick, which was usually administered under the species of bread alone; (3) in the Communion of children which was usually given, even in the churches, under the species of wine alone, but sometimes under the species of bread alone; (4) in the Communion under the species of bread alone at the Mass of the Presanctified, and as an optional practice, in some churches on ordinary occasions. To these examples may be added (5) the practice of the <em>intinctio panis</em>, i.e. the dipping of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> bread in the Precious Blood and its administration <em>per modum cibi</em>. We will notice briefly the history of each of these divergent practices.

<p>(1) During the third century, in Africa at least, as we learn from <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, the practice on the part of the faithful of bringing to their homes and reserving for private Communion a portion of the Eucharistic bread, would appear to have been universal. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> refers to this private domestic Communion as a commonplace in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, and makes it the basis of an argument, addressed to his wife against second marriage with an infidel in case of his own death: "Non sciet maritus quid secreto ante omnem cibum gustes et si sciverit esse panem, non illum credet esse qui dicitur?" (Ad Uxor. c. v, P.L. I, 1296). There can be question here only of the species of bread, and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the two stories told by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>: the one of a man who before Communion, had attended an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> function, and on retiring from the altar and opening his hand in which he had taken and carried the Sacred Species, found nothing in it but ashes; the other of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who "cum arcam suam, in qua Domini sanctum fuit, manibus indignis tentasset aperire igne inde surgente deterrita est" (<a href="../fathers/050703.htm"><em>De Lapsis</em> 26</a>). This custom owed its origin most probably to the dangers and uncertainties to which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were subject in times of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, but we have it on the authority of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (Ep. xciii, P.G., XXXII, 485) that in the fourth century, when the persecutions had ceased, it continued to be a general practice in <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and on the authority of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Ep. xlviii, 15, P.L. XXII, 506) that it still existed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> towards the end of same century. It is impossible to say at what precise period the practice disappeared. The many obvious objections against it would seem to have led to its abolition in the West without the need of formal legislation. The third canon attributed to the Council of Saragossa (380) and the fourteenth canon of the Council of Toledo (400), <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> those who do not consume in the church the Eucharist received from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, Conciliengesch., I, 744; II, 79), were directed against the Priscillianists (who refused to consume any portion of the Eucharistic bread in the church), and do not seem to have been intended to prohibit the practice of reserving a portion for private Communion at home. In the East the practice continued long after its disappearance in the West, and in the eighth century the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were able to avail themselves of it as a means of avoiding association with the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (Pargoire, L'&Eacute;glise byzantine, Paris, 1905, p. 339 sq.). It had already been adopted by the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a>, as St. Basil (loc. cit.) tells us, and continued to be a feature of anchoretic life as late as the ninth century (see Theodore Studita (d. 826), Ep. i, 57, ii, 209, in P.G. XCIX, 1115, 1661).

<p>(2) That Communion of the sick under the species of bread alone was the ordinary usage at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in the middle of the third century is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the account of the death-bed Communion of the old man Serapion as told by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.44</a>), on the authority of <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> (d. 264). It is recorded of St. Basil that he received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> several times on the day of his death, and under the species of bread alone, as may be inferred from the biographer's words (Vita Basilii, iv, P.G. XXIX, 315). We have it on the authority of Paulinus, secretary and biographer of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> on his death bed received from <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a> of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> "Domini corpus, quo accepto, ubi glutivit, emisit spiritum, bonum viaticum secum ferens" (Vita Ambr., 47, P.L., XIV, 43). These testimonies are sufficient to establish the fact that, in the early centuries, reservation of the Eucharist for the sick and dying, of which the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> (325) speaks (can. xiii) as "the ancient and canonical rule", was usual under one kind. The reservation of the species of wine for use as the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a> would have involved so many practical difficulties that, in the absence of clear evidence on the subject, we may feel sure that it was never the general practice. We are told by <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin Martyr</a> (<a href="../fathers/0126.htm#chapter67"><em>First Apology</em> 67</a>) that on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, after the celebration of the Sacrifice, the Eucharistic elements were received by all present and carried by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to those absent. But this would have been possible only in small and compact communities, and that it was not a general custom and did not long survive may be inferred from the fact that no subsequent mention of it is to be found. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Ep. cxxv, 20, P.L., XXII, 1085) speaks of St. Exuperitus of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, "qui corpus Domini canistro vimineo, sanguinem portat in vitro", but this example of a private devotional practice, which is also exceptional in its way, throws no light on the usage of communion for the sick. It is recorded in the life of <a href="../cathen/09763a.htm">St. Mary of Egypt</a> (21 sq., P.L. LXXIII, 686) that the Abbot Zosimos brought Communion under both kinds to her solitary retreat in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and in later times there are several examples of dying <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> communicating <em>sub utraque.</em> But everything leads us to suppose that such Communions, as a rule, were administered in connection with Mass, celebrated in the house of the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or in the immediate vicinity and this supposition is strongly confirmed by the well-known fact that the sick were sometimes carried to the church for the purpose of receiving both the Eucharist and Extreme Unction (see <a href="../cathen/03588c.htm">Chardon</a>, Hist. Du Sacrem. de l'Eucharistie, c. v, <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, Theol. Cursus Completus, XX, 282). It is to be noted, finally, that the sick who could not consume the Host were allowed to receive under the species of wine alone (Council of Toledo, 675, can. ii, <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XI, 143-4).

<p>(3) It was the practice in the Early Church to give the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> to children even before they attained the use of reason. It is implied by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (<a href="../fathers/050703.htm"><em>De Lapsis</em> 25</a>) that the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> alone was offered to them; and St. Augustine, in his incidental references to child Communion, speaks of it as administered under either species (Ep. ccxvii, 5, P.L. XXXIII, 984 sq.), or under the species of wine alone (Opus Imp., II, 30, P.L., XLV, 1154). <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a>, speaking of newly-baptized children, states that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> "cruda salutiteris imbuit ora cibis" (Ep. xxxii, 5, P.L., LXI, 333), which is applicable only to the species of wine. In the East also, in some churches at least, children, especially suckling infants, communicated under the species of wine alone (see Dom Martene, De Antiq. Eccl. Ritibus, I, xiv, Gasparri, Tract. canon. SS. Eucharista, II, n. 1121). There are examples, on the other hand, both in the Western and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>, of Communion administered to children under the species of bread alone. Thus the Council of <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a> (586) decreed that the fragments of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> bread remaining over after the Sunday communion were to be consumed by children (<em>innocentes</em>) brought to the church for that purpose on the following Wednesday or Friday (Labbe-Cossart VI, 675); and <a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a> (d. 594) tells us that a similar custom existed at Constantinople from ancient times (Hist. Eccl., IV, 36, P.G., LXXXVI. 2769).

<p>(4) The Mass of the Presanctified, in which the essence of the sacrifice as such is wanting, admits of Communion only under the species of bread. The custom of celebrating in this manner was introduced in the East by the Council of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> in the fourth century (can. xlix) and confirmed by the Second <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Council in Trullo</a> in 692 (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, op. cit., I, 772). It was the rule for all fast days during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were in the habit of receiving at it (Pargoire, op. cit, p. 341 sq.). This custom is still maintained in the East (Gasparri, op. cit., n. 68). In the West the Mass of the Presanctified, celebrated only on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, is mentioned in the Gelasian Sacramentary (P. L, LXXIV, 1105) and in later sources, and in the beginning the faithful used to communicate at it. Apart from the Class of the Presanctified the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were sometimes allowed to receive under the species of bread alone, even at the public Communion in the church. From an incident recorded by <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> (H.E., VIII, v, P.L., LXVII, 1528 sq.) as having occurred at Constantinople in the time of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, it would seem to follow that the reception of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> bread alone was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the then existing discipline. The point of the story is, that the unconverted wife of a converted Macedonian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, being compelled by her husband to communicate in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, secretly substituted at the moment of reception a piece of ordinary bread, which her servant had brought for the purpose, but was balked in her deceitful design by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, which petrified the bread with the marks of her teeth upon it. In the West, as is clear from <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a> (Serm. xlii, 5, P.L., LIV, 279 sq.), the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, towards the middle of the fifth century, sometimes succeeded in communicating <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulently</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: "ore indigno corpus Christi accipiunt, sanguinem autem redemptionis nostrae haurire omnino declinant". This <em>sacrilega simulatio</em> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> would have been impossible, unless it was customary at the time for at least some of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to receive under one kind alone. That those detected in this <em>simulatio</em> are ordered by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> to be excluded altogether from Communion, implies no reprobation on the merits of Communion under one kind; and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> attributed by Gratian to Pope Gelasius, "aut integra sacramenta percipiant, aut ab integris arceantur" (De Consec., D. II, c. xii, P.L., CLXXXVII, 1736). In the monastic rule attributed to St. Columbanus (d. 615) it is prescribed that <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and those not properly instructed "ad calicem non accedant" (P.L., LXXX, 220). This also seems to imply the usage in some cases of Communion under one kind; and, as a further instance of divergence in this direction from Communion strictly <em>sub utraque</em>, may be mentioned the practice, introduced about this time, of substituting for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine, in the Communion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, ordinary wine into which a few drops of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> wine had been poured. According to the "Ordo Romanus Primus", which in its present form dates from the ninth century, this usage was followed at the <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (see Mabillon, P.L., LXXVIII, 875, 882, 903). It was adopted also in several other churches (Dom Mart&egrave;ne, op. cit., I, ix). Some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the period held with <a href="../cathen/01376b.htm">Amalarius of Metz</a>; (d. 837) (De Eccl. off., I, 15, P.L., CV, 1032) that in this case the common wine received a certain <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> by the infusion of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> drops; but the majority, including <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> (Ep. lxix, 2, P.L., CLXXXII, 181), denied that there was any <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in the proper sense, or that the reception of this <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> was strictly speaking the reception of the Precious Blood.

<p>(5) The practice of the <em>intinctio Panis</em>, mentioned above, which is the last disciplinary variation to be noticed during this period, was already forbidden by the Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> in 675 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XI, 155), but, as from the "Micrologus" (xix, P.L., CLI, 989 sq.), was reintroduced in the eleventh century. It was condemned once more by the Council of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (1095) under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, but with the limitation "nisi per necessitatem et per cautelam" (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XX, 818). The exception "per cautelam" allows the <em>intinctio</em> when it might be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as a precaution against the spilling of the Precious Blood, but the later prohibition of Paschal II (Ep. 535, P.L. CLXIII, 442) makes an exception only in "parvulis ac omnino infirmis qui panem absorbere non possunt". Notwithstanding these prohibitions the practice survived in many places, as we learn from Robert Pulleyn (d. 1146; Sent. VIII, iii, P.L., CLXXXVI, 964), who condemns it. Its prohibition is renewed as late as 1175 by a Council of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> or Westminster (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, op. cit., v, 688). There is no evidence of the <em>intinctio</em> in the East during the first ten centuries, but its existence in the eleventh century is one of the grounds of reproach advanced by Cardinal Humbert (d. 1061) against the Greeks. (Adv. Grec. calumnias, 33, B.L., CXLII, 967 sq.). According to Dom Mart&egrave;ne (d.1739) the practice still existed in the East in his own time (op. cit., I, 13); while the custom of pouring some of the Precious Blood on the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> bread, which was then dried by heating and reserved during a whole year for the Communion of the sick, may be considered as a kind of <em>intinctio.</em> This latter custom was prohibited by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> for the Italo-Greeks in 1752, but the usage, where it existed among them, of receiving the Host on a spoon with some drops of the Precious Blood, was allowed to be retained (Gasparri, op. cit., II, 1177).

<p>It is abundantly clear from this brief survey of disciplinary variations during the first twelve centuries that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> never regarded Communion under both kinds as a matter of Divine precept.
<h3>Since the twelfth century</h3>

<p>The final suppression of <em>intinctio</em> was followed in the thirteenth century by the gradual abolition for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of Communion under the species of wine. The desuetude of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> was not yet universal in <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas'</a> time (d. 1274): "provide in quibusdam ecclesiis observatur", he says "ut populo sanguis sumendus non detur, sed solum a sacerdote sumatur" (Summa, III, Q. lxxx, a. 12). The Council of Lambeth (1281) directs that wine is to be received by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> alone, and non-consecrated wine is to be received by the faithful (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XXIV, 405). It is impossible to say exactly when the new custom became universal or when, by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> approval, it acquired the force of law. But such was already the case long the outbreak of the Hussite disturbances, as is clear from the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (see I above). The Council of Basle granted (1433) the use of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> to the Calixtines of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> under certain conditions, the chief of which was acknowledgment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> integral presence under either kind. This concession, which had never been approved by any <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, was positively revoked in 1462 by the Nuncio Fantini on the order of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> while defining the points already mentioned, referred to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the decision of the question whether the urgent petition of the German emperor to have the use of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> allowed in his dominions be granted; and in 1564 <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> authorized some German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to permit it in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, provided certain conditions were fulfilled. But, owing to the inconveniences that were found to result, this concession was withdrawn in the following year. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> states (De Missae Sacrif. II, xxii. n. 32) that in his time the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had the privilege of communicating <em>sub utraque</em> at their <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> and on their death-bed. In the eighteenth century the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> officiating at High Mass in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Saint-Denis, Paris, on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and solemn feasts, and at Cluny on all feasts of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, were allowed to receive <em>sub utraque</em> (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, loc. cit.) The only surviving example of this privilege is in the case of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> officiating in the solemn Mass of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Theological speculation</h2>

<p>The definition of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, to the effect that the communicant under one kind is deprived of no grace <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (see I), was intended merely to negate the Utraquist contention, and is not to be understood as implying that Communion under one kind involves incompleteness of sacramental <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> or a curtailment of sacramental grace. The council had no thought of deciding this point, which had been held to be an open question by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> since the twelfth century and has continued to be treated as such down to our own day. Without attempting to sketch the history of the discussion, we will state here very briefly the ultimate form which the question has assumed and the opposing answers that have been given.

<p>It is a recognized principle in sacramental <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> cause what they signify, and the present discussion turns upon the interpretation of this principle in reference to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. Does the principle mean, not merely that the external rites are intended to signify, in a sufficiently distinctive way, the special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> they were instituted to confer, but that their efficiency in the production of grace is measured by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of clearness (where decrees are admissible) with which the sacramental signification is expressed? In the Eucharist grace is symbolized as spiritual refection or aliment, after the analogy of corporal nourishment; and this signification is admittedly expressed with greater clearness in the distinct reception of both species than in Communion in one kind. Are we to hold, therefore, that Communion <em>sub utraque</em>, being a more perfect symbol of a complete refection, conters a fuller degree of sacramental grace than Communion under one kind, or in other words, that by Divine institution there is a twofold <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> or two distinct lines of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> in the Eucharist, corresponding to the two modes of reception, and that both lines of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> are required for the complete production of its fruits? A minority of the great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have answered this question in the affirmative, e.g. Vasquez (in III, Q. lxxx, a.12, disp. ccxv, c.ii), <a href="../cathen/09418b.htm">De Lugo</a> (De Sac Euch. disp. xii, iii, 68 sq.), the <a href="../cathen/13401c.htm">Salmanticenses</a> (De. Euch. Sac., disp. x, 52 sq.) Arguing on the lines indicated these <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> hold that <em>per se</em> Communion under both kinds confers more grace than Communion under one kind, and admit that the modern <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> withdraws this opportunity of more abundant grace from the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. But in doing so it inflicts they maintain, no notable spiritual privation, withholding no grace that is even remotely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; while, indirectly, the many advantages resulting from this discipline, particularly the increased reverence for the sacrament which it secures and the additional opportunities for frequent Communion which it provides, more than make up for whatever loss is involved. The majority of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, however, rightly deny that Communion under one kind involves <em>per se</em> any loss or curtailment of sacramental grace. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (III, Q. lxxx, a. 12, ad 3) and <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> (In Sent. IV, XI, punct. ii, a. 1, q. 2) may fairly be claimed for this view, which is defended by Cajetan (In III, q. lxxx, a. 12, II), Dominicus Soto (In Sent. IV, XII, q. i.a. 12, II), <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (De Sac. Euch., IV, 33), Francisco Su&aacute;rez (In III, q. lxxix, a. 8, disp. lxiii, VI, 8, sq.), Sylvius (In III, q. lxxx, a. 12, q. 2), <a href="../cathen/06634a.htm">Gonet</a> (De Sac. Euch. disp. viii, 4, 11, 69), and a host of later writers. While admitting that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> cause what they signify, these <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> deny that the extent of their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> is dependent on the mode or degree of perfection in which this signification is realized, or that there is any ground for distinguishing a twofold <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> in the Eucharist depending on the twofold manner of reception. There is all the more reason for denying this in the case of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, since both the Body and Blood of Christ are <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">really present</a> and the complete refection intended by Christ are really received, under either species alone; and since, moreover, in the production of whatever grace is given, in addition to the grace of mere presence the more important cause is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself in His sacred humanity personally present in the recipient. Must we hold that Christ limited the grace-giving efficacy of His invisible presence so as to make it dependent on the accidental mode in which that presence is visibly symbolized rather than on the presence itself? Or that He curtailed the spiritually nutritive effects of what is <em>de facto</em> complete as an aliment and, as such, is sufficiently symbolized by either species, merely because the physical analogy in the manner of reception is not reproduced as literally and completely as it might be? Even in the natural order we do not always insist on the distinction between eating and drinking in reference to our bodily refection, and in the spiritual and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> sphere, where there is question of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> refection by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, it is surely an overstraining of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of sacramental symbolism to urge that distinction as insistently as do <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the first opinion. Such briefly is the line of argument by which the common opinion is supported. It only remains to add that in this opinion the reception of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> may augment, <em>per accidens</em>, the grace of the sacrament, by securing a longer continuance of the species and thereby of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>, and by helping to prolong or renew the fervent dispositions of the recipient.
