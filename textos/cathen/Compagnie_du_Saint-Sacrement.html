<h1>Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret society</a> which included among its members many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> celebrities of the seventeenth century. It was founded in March, 1630, at the Convent of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> in the Faubourg Saint-Honore by Henri de Levis, Duc de Ventadour, who had just escorted his wife to the Convent of Mont-Carmel; Henri de Pichery, officer of Louis XIII's household; Jacques Adhemar de Monteil de Grignan, a future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and Philippe d'Angoumois, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>. Amongst those who soon joined it, should be mentioned Pere Suffren, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, confessor to Louis XIII and Marie de' Medici; the son and grandson of Coligny, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> admiral, and Charles de Condren, General of the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>. In 1631 this association was called the Company of the Most <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. It was organized under the authority of a board composed of nine members, changed every three months, and which included a superior, usually a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> who was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The associates met weekly and their organization was simultaneously a <a href="../cathen/04223a.htm">pious confraternity</a>, a charitable <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, and a militant association for the defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The company was an absolutely secret one. Louis XIII covertly encouraged it but it never wished to have the letters patent that would have rendered it legal. Archbishop Gondi of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> refused his blessing to the company although, in 1631, Louis XIII wrote him a personal letter requesting him to confer it. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1633 by the Count de Brassan, one of the members, was of no importance and the company, eager to secure a new one, was granted only a few <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> which it would not accept, as it did not wish to be treated as a simple confraternity. Guido Bagni, <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> from 1645 to 1656 often attended the sessions of the company but its existence was never regularly acknowledged by an official document from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The rule of secrecy <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> members "not to speak of the company to those who do not belong to it and never to make known the names of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> composing it. New members were elected by the board and it was soon decided that no <em>congr&eacute;ganiste</em>, i.e. member of a lay congregation directed by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, could be eligible. Matters of an especially delicate nature were not discussed at the weekly meetings, these being frequently attended by a hundred members, but were reserved for the investigation of the board. The company printed nothing and the keeping of written minutes was conducted with the utmost caution. There were fifty important branches outside of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, about thirty being unknown even to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Among other members were the Prince de Conti, the Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal de Schomberg, the Baron de Renty, Magistrates <a href="../cathen/08766a.htm">Lamoignon</a>, de Mesnes, and Le F&egrave;vre d'Ormesson; Alain de Solminihac, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, now declared Venerable; <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">Olier</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>. The association laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> to correct abuses among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to insure good behaviour in the churches, to procure missions for country <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and it had the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of urging the establishment of a Seminary of Foreign Missions for the evangelizing of infidels. It also endeavoured to reform the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> by encouraging effective <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">Marquis de Salignac-F&eacute;nelon</a> against <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duelling</a>. Moreover, it was interested in the care of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the improvement of <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and the administration of galleys and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>; and that the poor might have legal advice, it created today known as the <em>secr&eacute;tariats du peuple</em>. It protected the fraternities of shoemakers and tailors organized by the Baron de Renty and assisted <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> in most of his undertakings. In 1652 when <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, conqueror of the Fonde re-entered <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the city was flood with peasants, fugitive religious, hungry <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the members of the company multiplied their generous deeds, demanded <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from their fellow-members outside of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, sent <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to hear the confessions of the sick decimated by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, founded <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for the relief of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and established at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> a general storehouse stocked with provisions, clothing, and agricultural implements to be distributed among the impoverished peasants. At that time the company spent 380,000 livres (equal 300,000 dollars) in charity each year. Finally, it was instrumental in bringing about the ordinance establishing the General Hospital where Christophe du Plessis, the magistrate, and <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> organized the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> for <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicants</a>.

<p>Even those historians to whom the secret character of this association is obnoxious, give due credit to its admirable charities, but they attack its action in regard to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The company laboured diligently to increase conversions and organized the preaching of missions for <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, Dauphine, and Limousin and founded establishments in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Sedan, <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, and Puy for young converts from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Moreover, it strove to suppress the outrages perpetrated by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion and opposed the oppression of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> city like La Rochelle. Finally, without seeking the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Company nevertheless remained constantly on the alert, lest any concession be made to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> beyond what the formal text of the edict demanded and its members sent documents to Jean Filleau, a Poitiers lawyer, who for twenty-five years issued "Catholic decisions" from a juridical point of view, on the interpretation of the Edict of Nantes. The protestation of the general assembly of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in 1656 against the infringement of the edict by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, was the outgrowth of a long documental work prepared by the members. In 1660, Lechassier who was <em>Ma&icirc;tre des Comptes</em> and also one of the company, forwarded to all the country branches a <em>questionnaire</em>, i.e. a series of questions soaked with a view to helping the inquiry, of thirty-one articles on the infringement of the Edict of Nantes by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The answers were collected by Forbin-Janson, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">Digne</a>, who took active part in the assembly of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the result being that commissaries were sent into the provinces for the purpose of setting right these abuses. But, in its own turn, the company violated the Edict of Nantes (of which Art. 27 declared <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> wholly eligible to public office), and, by secret manoeuvring, one day prevented twenty-five young <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> from being received as attorneys at the Parlement of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. "The members thought they were doing right", explained P&egrave;re de la Briere "nevertheless, if we consider not their intention, but the very nature of their act and of their procedure, it is impossible to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they were guilty of an iniquity". According to the testimony of P&egrave;re Rapin and the Count d'Argenson, these proceedings of the Company were the starting-point of the policy that was to culminate in 1685 in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.

<p>The year 1660 witnessed the decline of the company. In consequence of incidents that had occurred at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>, it was vigorously attacked in a <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libel</a> by Charles du Four, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Aulnay, and denounced to <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Cardinal Mazarin</a> by Fran&ccedil;ois Harlay de Champvallon <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. On 13 December, 1660, the members held a last general meeting at which, amid expressions of regret and deep emotion, it was decided to suspend their Thursday sessions and to add "ten or twelve elders" to the members of the board so that the company might continue to act provisionally; then these elders and the board selected eight <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> who were to correspond with the country branches one of the eight being <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>. On 13 December, 1660, Parliament issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> prohibiting all illicit assemblies, confraternities, congregations, and communities but <a href="../cathen/08766a.htm">Lamoignon</a>, a member of the company and the first president, succeeded in preventing it from being designated by name. It seems that the meeting of the board and the elders held regularly enough in 1664 to be instrumental in obtaining the interdiction of "Tartuffe", ceased almost altogether in 1665. The General Hospital and the Seminary of Foreign Missiors continued to exist as magnificent legacies of this association which <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> and many hostile historians who came after him, scornfully called the "Cabal of Devotees".
