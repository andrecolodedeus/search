<h1>Comte de Charles-Auguste-Marie-Joseph Forbin-Janson</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> and Toul, founder of the Association of the Holy Childhood, born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 3 Nov., 1785; died near <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, 12 July, 1844. He was the second son of Count Michel Palam&egrave;de de Forbin-Janson and of his wife Corn&eacute;lie Henriette, princess of Gal&eacute;an. He was a Knight of Malta from childhood, and a soldier at sixteen. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a> made him Auditor of the Council of State in 1805. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and the aristocracy looked forward to a most brilliant career as a statesman for him, but he surprised all by entering the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St-Sulpice in the spring of 1808. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> in 1811, and was made <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Diocese of Chamb&eacute;ry</a>, but eventually determined to become a missionary. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> advised him to remain in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> where missionary work was needed. He heeded the advice, and with his friend the Abb&eacute; de Rauzan, founded the <em>Missionaires de France</em> and preached with great success in all parts of his native land. In 1817 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> on a mission, returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1819, and again took up the work of a missionary until 1823 when he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> and Toul, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 6 June, 1824, by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>; Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston, U.S.A.</a>, was a consecrator and Bishop Fenwick of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> a witness. The French Government did not cease persecuting him for his refusal to sign the Gallican Declaration of 1682; finally, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1830, but succeeded in getting his own choice of a coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by threatening to return to Nancy. Every good cause appealed to his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> heart, every good work to his purse. He aided <a href="../cathen/08323b.htm">Pauline Jaricot</a> in the establishment of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. At the request of Bishop Flaget and <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell</a>, <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> sent him on a missionary tour through the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a> in 1839.

<p>During his two years stay in that country, he travelled far and wide giving missions to the people and retreats to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Louisiana was the first conspicuous field of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and he brought its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in numbers which have hardly been equalled since. On his way thither, he contributed one-third of the money with which the <a href="../cathen/05794a.htm">Fathers of Mercy</a> bought Spring Hill College (now a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a>, near <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, Alabama). All the large cities of the country, from New York to Dubuque; from <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> to Quebec, were witnesses of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. More at home in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> where his mother-tongue was spoken, he did wonderful missionary work, and some events regarded as <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> keep his memory alive to this day among the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French-Canadian</a> people. He attended the Fourth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. His last visit in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was to Philadelphia, in November, 1841, when he assisted at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Dr. Kenrick</a> as coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Louis. He left New York for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in December, 1841, and the next year visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to give an account of his mission in America. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> named him a Roman Count and Assistant at the Pontifical Throne, "because of his wonderful <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the propagation and defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>". On his return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he founded (1843) the Society of the Holy Childhood, and spent that, and a part of the following year in spreading this good work through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Death came to him unexpectedly at his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> castle of Aygalades near Marselles.
