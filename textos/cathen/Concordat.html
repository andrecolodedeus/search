<h1>Concordat</h1>  

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Canonists and publicists do not agree about the nature of a concordat and, consequently, vary much in the definition they give. The various theories will be explained later, but for the sake of orderly discussion at least a nominal definition will be premised. In general, a concordat means an agreement, or union of wills, on some matter. But as soon as we attempt to define this general notion more clearly a difficulty arises. Agreement of wills may be had in many ways: in friendship, in regard to privileges, in a bilateral contract, etc. Prescinding for the present from the exact nature of a concordat, and without giving an exact definition, we may say that a concordat is a law, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil, made for a certain country in regard to matters which in some way concern both <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, a law, moreover, possessing the force of a treaty entered into by both the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> and to a certain extent binding upon both. The full meaning of the terms employed will be explained below.
<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of a concordat is to terminate, or to avert, dissension between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil powers</a>. This is evident from history. During the first three centuries, when the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> was bent upon the total ruin and destruction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, concordats were out of the question. After the era of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was over, and, with the exception of some temporary usurpations and outrages, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Emperors of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> generally recognized and defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, concordats were unnecessary. This state of affairs continued until the end of the eleventh century, when there arose the strife about investitures which was settled in 1122 by the Concordat of Worms, or <em>Pactum Callixtinum</em>, between <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> and Henry V. This may be called the first concordat, unless the agreement of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1107) is reckoned, as it may be, among the number of concordats. The contest between <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, at the end of the thirteenth century, opened the way for still further disagreements between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which strove to preserve its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> inviolate, and those <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil powers</a> which sought to usurp them. These disagreements gave rise to various concordats. Before the eighteenth century there were six (or seven if the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> agreement of 1107 be counted); during the eighteenth century there were fifteen, and in the nineteenth century a much larger number (see SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL CONCORDATS, below).

<p>It is to be noted that De Angelis, who is followed by Giobbio and in part by <a href="../cathen/03467c.htm">Cavagnis</a>, does not consider the <em>Pactum Callixtinum</em> a concordat, because in it <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> made no concession of any importance to the emperor. This reason, however, as Wernz well observes, is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. For, according to the best authorities on the <em>Pactum Callixtinum</em>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> granted to Henry V several important concessions, permitting the emperor to assist at episcopal elections and to exact from bishops-elect in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and from <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in other parts of the empire (i.e. in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>) not merely the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of simple loyalty but even that of vassalage, by which the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and liberties of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were considerably restricted. <a href="../cathen/03467c.htm">Cavagnis</a> likewise remarks about the first concordat with <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, in 1288, that it is rather a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in which, after hearing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the royal plenipotentiaries, he decided what should be allowed, what denied, out of the powers which the King claimed on the ground either of privilege or of custom. Granting all this, it does not seem to follow that such an act could not be called a concordat; for it is by no means evident that mutual concessions are essential to the very nature of a concordat. An agreement may very well exist without mutual concessions&mdash;a principle especially in accord with the view of those authorities (including <a href="../cathen/03467c.htm">Cavagnis</a>) who see in every concordat a strictly bilateral contract; for the due <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of either party can properly be recognized and established by any contract properly so called. Hence it is plain that concordats have <em>in general</em> been made in order to end a disagreement and restore harmony. Not <em>always</em>, however; for concordats have at times been made when there was no actual disagreement to be settled&mdash;solely for the purpose of preventing disagreements in the future and of rendering more secure and permanent the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in some State. This was done between <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and Garcia Morena, President of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> in 1862.

<p>With regard to the necessity of concordats two extreme opinions are to be avoided. Concordats are not absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; neither are they harmful to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Assuredly it were to be desired that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should never need concordats, and should always find in civil rulers devoted children, or at least such as would use all diligence in caring for the spiritual welfare of their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects, and would religiously respect their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. But, unfortunately, the contrary too often occurs. Hence the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to avoid a greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, has often had to promise to forego this or that natural right of her own in order to secure from the State a promise to refrain from further encroachment upon <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>.
<h3>Matter or object of a concordat</h3>

<p>The matter, or the objects, treated of in a concordat may be spiritual, mixed, or temporal.

<p>Spiritual matters are those that belong purely to the spiritual order, or are connected with it: for example, matters pertaining to the liturgy. Thus, in some concordats there has been question of inserting the name of the emperor in the Canon and of singing after the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> the formula: "Domine, salvam fac rempublicam", or "Domine, salvos fac consules", or "Domine, salvos fac pr&aelig;sides eius" (cf. art. 8, of the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>; arts. 23, 24 of the Concordat with Costa Rica and <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, 1853; arts. 15, with Haiti, 1860; art. 21, with <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, 1862; arts. 22, 23, with Nicaragua and San Salvador, 1863). In like manner there is frequent mention of nominating <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, of the establishment and bestowal of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, or of prescribing special regulations for the promotion of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> or to <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a>, so as to prevent, for example, the number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> from becoming too large (cf. art. 5, Concordat with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1737; C. iv, Concordat with <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, 1741), and so on.



<p>Mixed matters are those which belong, though under different aspects, both to the temporal and spiritual orders, and are subject to both authorities, such as public <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, marriage, etc.

<p>Temporal matters are such as of their own nature do not belong to the spiritual order. In some concordats the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has allowed rulers to impose taxes not only on the private possessions of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, but also on <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>; so the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> has at times given up his claims on account of certain <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical properties</a> damaged in the course of civil or religious turmoil. Examples of each of these occur in the Concordat with Columbia, in 1887. It is to be noted that, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> absolutely surrenders temporal possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as in art. 29 of this concordat, such possessions no longer remain under the ownership or <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or subject to it. When, however, he merely permits such <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to be taxed (as in art. 6 of the Colombian Concordat, art. 18 or art. 19 of that with Costa Rica, in 1853) then the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> remains in the ownership of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which does not acknowledge in the State any inherent right to impose taxes of this kind, but rather implies the contrary by the very concession.
<h3>The contracting parties</h3>

<p>It is clear that only those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in Church or State are competent to enter into a concordat who in their respective spheres have the right of making treaties, and indeed of enacting <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Hence, absolutely speaking, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> rulers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> vested with authority to make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> strictly so called, can also make concordats on all matters falling within their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. In past ages they have often exercised this right; a concordat was made between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and King Diniz in 1288, and confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> in 1289. In 1273 one was made between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> and Magnus VI (IV), by which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> renounced the right of electing the king as long as there were legitimate heirs of the blood, and the king on his part bound himself to prevent the royal officials from interfering with the free exercise of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. This concordat was confirmed in the following year by <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a>. Many other concordats made by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> might be mentioned; for example, between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and King Manuel, confirmed by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in 1516. Candido Mendes de Almeida, in his "Jus Civile Ecclesiasticum Brasilicum Vetus et Recens", enumerates eighteen concordats made between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries by the Kings of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the kingdom, for the settlement of serious controversies. At the present time <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> do not possess the power of making concordats; it is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The reason for this reservation is that concordats deal not with one question only, but with the settlement of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters in a particular country; such a wide field of affairs manifestly constitutes a <em>causa major</em>, and as such is reserved exclusively for the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>. Moreover, in recent concordats concessions have almost always been made contrary to the ordinary canon law, and such concessions can be made only by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It should also be noted that governments desirous of entering into a concordat with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> prefer to deal with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, so as to have a regulation by which all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> will be bound. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> in making a concordat acts in his capacity as pontiff, and not as a civil ruler; and this was the case even before he was despoiled of his temporal sovereignty. Hence, in making a concordat, he acts as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and, as Supreme Ruler and Pastor of the Universal Church, exercises the supreme and full authority of his primacy.

<p>On the part of the State those competent to make concordats are supreme legislators or chief magistrates&mdash;an emperor, king, or president, acting alone, where the supreme authority is plenary and unrestricted; acting with the consent of the representative body, where such consent is constitutionally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for legislation. Wernz (Jus Decret., I, 166) remarks: "The <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, to avoid the risk of open mockery, usually enters into solemn undertakings only where a civil government is under no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to seek the consent of a representative body, or where there can be no reasonable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that such consent will be granted." It is also to be remembered that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> makes concordats with governments only in their civil capacity, even when such governments are non-Catholic. Hence it cannot be supposed that a concordat with the Tsar of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> or the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> is made with either of these potentates as with the supreme spiritual head of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> or <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>.
<h3>Nature of concordats</h3>

<p>To explain the nature of concordats three theories have been proposed:

<ul><li>The legal theory, that advanced by the regalists; <li>The compact theory, which regards a concordat as a bilateral contract; <li>The privilege theory, according to which a concordat has the force of a privilege on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>, but of an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> on the part of the civil ruler.</ul>

<p>Before explaining and examining these theories in detail, it is well to note first of all that the name given to each theory should not be understood as if the authors of the various opinions considered all the articles of a concordat as possessing equal force. Those who defend the privilege theory do not maintain that no article in any concordat ever imposed an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>. On the other hand, those who defend the compact theory do not assert that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> is bound in the same way by all the articles of every concordat. These theories have been named, as Wernz points out, from the feature most prominent in each. It is clear, then, that authors who defend the privilege theory maintain, in the last resort, no more than this: that, in respect to the greater part of their matter, concordats must be classed as privileges granted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>. Nevertheless, as this subject matter of a concordat is not necessarily homogeneous (the unity of a concordat being merely extrinsic and accidental) it follows that although the term <em>privilege</em> may be applied to a concordat taken as a whole, it cannot necessarily be used of every clause in the same.</p>

<p>(a) The Legalist Theory does not admit that concordats have the force of a bilateral contract, because the State is above the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and, being the supreme <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, cannot make such an agreement with an inferior or subordinate body. Concordats are valid, however, because they are civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> passed by the State in regard to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It follows from this view that concordats may always be revoked by the State, but not by the Pontiff; as far as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is concerned they are mere privileges revocable at the will of the civil ruler. This theory is held in our days more or less strictly by various governments and many writers, chief of whom is Hinschius.

<p>(b) The Compact Theory, as we have said, makes of the concordat a bilateral compact. It must be observed, however, that the advocates of this view are divided among themselves. Some hold strenuously that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> can make no change whatsoever, not even validly, in regard to anything which he has conceded in a concordat. The chief writer of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is Schulte, an ex-Catholic, who openly bases his views of concordats on his assumption of the perfect co-ordination and equality of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, just as the legalist theory is founded on the subordination of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. Others, among whom we may enumerate De Angelis, <a href="../cathen/03467c.htm">Cavagnis</a>, and Fink, while upholding the compact theory, so explain it as to fully accord with strict <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> on the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A concordat, in their opinion, is a bilateral compact, but not in the strict sense of the term. Indeed they so limit and weaken the force of a contract as applied to a concordat that at times they seem to be maintaining the view of those who hold that a concordat is to be considered as a privilege rather than a real contract.

<p>(c) The Privilege Theory, according to which concordats, if we regard their general character and the bulk of their contents, lack for the most part the force of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> contract, and are to be considered as imposing an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> on the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> alone, while on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> they are merely privileges or concessions granted by the Roman Pontiffs.

<p>This view, which counts among its recent staunch defenders <a href="../cathen/14458c.htm">Cardinal Tarquini</a>, seems to rest upon surer grounds than the others. Before advancing the arguments in its favour, it would be well to examine the position of its opponents. It is evident that the advocates of the first, or legalist, theory build all their arguments upon the supposition that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is subject to the State, of which it forms but a department, just as any other body is subject to the whole of which it is a part and from which, consequently, it depends. This view we find expressly maintained by Hinschius, who says: "The theory that asserts that a concordat possesses the force of a contract seems untenable, notwithstanding the vast numbers of its followers. According to the modern <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> the authority of the State over all matters falling within its sphere is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Churches</a> which exist within the territory of any State are subject to that State in just the same manner as are private corporations or <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>." Hammerstein, in his clever refutation of these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> (De Ecclesi&acirc; et Statu juridice consideratis, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, p. 211) says that this "sphere", within which the State is said to be <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, may be understood in a juridical or a geographical sense, i.e. as signifying the limits either of the State's <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> or of its geographical possessions. If taken in the first sense, the grandiose words of Hinschius become puerile, if in the second sense, then Hinschius is advocating a legal enormity. For if the word <em>sphere</em> be taken to signify "extent of authority", the assertion of Hinschius means nothing more than that the State can, within the limits of its own <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and authority, do what it will. And it needed no <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> to proclaim this, since it is abundantly evident that anyone can do all whatsoever he can do. If, on the other hand, <em>sphere</em> be taken in the sense of "geographical extension", Hinschius is maintaining that the State may, within the bounds of its own territory, perpetrate any crime it chooses. To quote Hammerstein, "We have said that the phrase, 'the State's sphere', can be understood to mean geographical extension. In this case, the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> canonist, Hinschius, when taken in the concrete, practically comes to this,&mdash;that within the territory of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a> the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> government can, without any <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> whatever, behead, burn alive, or spoil of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> all whomsoever it pleases and because it pleases; and why? Because the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> government is&mdash;omnipotent! Surely a wonderful system of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>!" Moreover, it is noteworthy that the very principle which this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of writers assume as the basis of their argument, namely that no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> compact can exist between a sovereign power and its subordinates (whence they argue that between the civil and the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> no compact can exist entailing strict <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> upon the former), this fundamental principle is not only <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in itself but is contradicted by their own theories. For they maintain that a strict compact can be made between ruler and ruled, whereby the authority of the former may be diminished, or even partially or wholly abolished.

<p>Those who claim that concordats are to be considered as bilateral contracts in the strictest sense of the word experience in trying to maintain their assertion the same difficulty as the followers of the legalist theory. They, too, have recourse to a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> principle, that of the perfect co-ordination and equality of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. It does not fall within the scope of this article to show the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> of this assumption; suffice to say in passing, that the co-ordination or subordination of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> among themselves is to be determined by the co-ordination or subordination of the ends for the attainment of which said <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> were instituted; now the end the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has to attain is superior to that of any other <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>.

<p>The arguments of those who hold that concordats are bilateral contracts, though only in the broad sense of the term, are based upon their language and diplomatic form. For they argue that these clearly show that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> themselves regarded concordats as concessions to which were annexed the binding force of a compact, and that in making them they intended to bind themselves by them sometimes to the extent of declaring null and void whatever they themselves or their <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a> should do in contravention of anything contained in their concordats. An example in point is the concordat between <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I of France</a>. Furthermore, it is claimed that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> often have referred to concordats, directly or equivalently, as bilateral contracts, or agreements carrying with them a strict <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Thus Fink, in his work "De Concordatis" (Louvain, 1879), when summing up his argument says: "In the estimation of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, concordats are solemn agreements with regard to the management of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, entered into by the supreme authorities, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil, of the respective countries; they are possessed of the full efficacy of a strict <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and have the force of a compact binding both contracting parties, after the manner of international treaties. Besides the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the binding force of a concordat is strengthened by a solemn promise made by each party for himself and his successors to observe forever faithfully and inviolably all that has been agreed upon. Unless, then, by mutual consent, no concordat can be broken without violating every principle of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and jeopardizing all other private and public contracts." Other arguments are drawn from expressions occurring in the diplomatic correspondence of the Papal Secretary of State. As a matter of fact, much of what we have just given from Fink is to be found not in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents themselves, but in the correspondence of the Secretariate of State. Lastly, the advocates of this form of the compact theory assert that the common opinion among canonists is also in their favour. But, with all due respect to the learned scholars who hold and defend the opinion, the argument drawn from the form of the concordat has but little weight. For it is not at all rare for an act to be clothed with a form which, though, perhaps, less adapted to the nature of the act itself, yet in no way changes that nature. For example, the formula of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> is deprecatory, yet this form of entreaty in no way changes the judicial nature of the pronouncement. So, too, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> deposed Henry IV by a form of deprecation, yet it cannot be denied that the judgment passed was truly condemnatory. So also a religious before his solemn profession may renounce all his possessions under the form of a will, which form endures even after his profession, while the nature of the act is essentially changed, since there no longer exists that <em>voluntas ambulatoria</em> which a last will and testament of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> requires. Nor are the arguments drawn now and then from solemn promises any stronger. For the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> often calls certain concessions mentioned in concordats "privileges", "indults", etc., etc., and at times speaks even more precisely, asserting that he will in no way interfere in the doing of this or that. If at times the stricter formul&aelig; are employed, as in the concordat between <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> (a formula which seems to be the strictest of all and decrees as null and void whatever to the contrary is attempted by subsequent pontiffs), they are employed, as Palmieri notes in the first edition of his treatise "De Romano Pontifice", first, that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may testify to his firm purpose of observing, in as far as he may, the points mentioned in the concordat: secondly, because of the scope of the instrument itself, which is similar to an agreement entered into by a father and his disobedient children. In such reconciliations it often happens that a formula is used between a father and a child still under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which verbally signifies a bilateral contract, but which in point of fact is employed for the sole purpose of manifesting the leniency and liberality of the father. Thirdly, very often such formul&aelig; are employed because of the unity of the act itself. That this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is evident because at times there are articles which bind the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and also because by a concordat a civil ruler (i.e. in the case of a concordat drawn up with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> prince) is really and truly bound by obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>. Hence, although the latter is bound to his promise only through fidelity to his word, it was deemed advisable to use a common form which, as in the case of bilateral contracts, implies a mutual <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, the nature and interpretation of which is sufficiently evident from the nature and tenor of the concordat itself. It is also to be noted that emphatic phrases such as those above mentioned, employed with a view to express the firm determination of the legislator, are not at all rare; so, for instance, there is sometimes attached to a code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> a clause derogatory of all future <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> v. g. "by virtue of this unchangeable constitution which is to endure forever". Yet no one claims that a subsequent legislator is bound by such a clause, nor that he cannot abrogate the constitution in whole or in part. That the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> admit that concordats are identical with bilateral contracts, is not wholly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For they are rarely called such, the ordinary expression being that they have the force of a bilateral contract &mdash; something entirely different. For (as Baldi notes in his excellent work on concordats, "De Natur&acirc; et Indole Concordatorum) all such technical phrases as, "to have the same binding force as a treaty", "to be a species of <a href="../cathen/04332a.htm">contract</a>", "to partake of the nature of a privilege", "to resemble a gift"&mdash;all these signify nothing else than participation in, and not identity with, the nature of all of these. Just as when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> declares, "The admission of postulation has the force of confirmation", it is legitimate to conclude, "therefore admission of <a href="../cathen/12319c.htm">postulation</a> is not confirmation but participates in and approaches to, as far as its nature allows, the nature of confirmation. Again, it argues nothing against the opinion held in the article that concordats are sometimes expressly designated bilateral agreements or contracts (perhaps once: to wit, in the letter of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 16 Feb., 1892, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and faithful of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>), since in such cases it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wished only to observe all the conventionalities of concordats &mdash; in so far at least as <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> permitted. It was not the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> intention to define and determine the exact essence of a concordat, but rather to manifest his mind on the matter in question, and give assurance that he, on his part, would not violate the articles agreed upon. Relative to this matter Wernz says: "Pius X praised Bonald because he brought to his notice the nature and peculiar characteristic of these agreements or <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a>." Then, too, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> earnestly recommended that the question of concordats be seriously and thoroughly looked into. Surely the praise of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius</a> and the recommendation of Leo would have been utterly foolish if the theory of bilateral contracts had been evidently and unquestionably adopted by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>.

<p>Of less value is the argument drawn from individual phrases occurring occasionally in diplomatic correspondence. For, apart from the fact that never, perhaps, in these diplomatic notes is a concordat said to be identical with a bilateral contract, it must also be granted, and that without evasion, that the weakest kind of argument is that drawn from one or another phrase used by some Cardinal Secretary of State, or some Apostolic Nuncio in a single diplomatic note. For the admission is not forced upon us that these phrases are the best that under the circumstances could be chosen. It is also <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> that the treaty theory is more commonly held by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists. For neither is this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the modern canonists, while it is absolutely <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> of those of earlier date, very many of whom (as Baldi clearly proves in his erudite commentary on concordats already cited) held the opinion advanced in this paper. This opinion, it must be noted, is based on two principles: first, that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> are not co-ordinate; secondly, that the power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> can be neither alienated nor diminished. On this point Wernz wisely remarks: "If the co-ordination of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> be urged as an argument, then the treaty theory is founded either on an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or on a pure fiction lacking all objective reality." (Cf. S&auml;gmuller, "Lehrbuch des kath. Kirchenrechts", 89 sqq.) Hence it follows that it is utterly impossible to call a concordat an international treaty in the real and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of the word (cf. a pamphlet anonymously edited in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1872, under the title: "Della Natura e carattere essenziale dei Concordati", whose author was Cardinal Cagiano de Azevedo). Neither can the concordat be classed with international treaties, since the latter are entered upon by two <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> each perfect in itself and both equal. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on the other hand, is neither subordinate to, nor equal to, the State, but is in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense its superior. Hence, also, it follows that concordats are not bilateral contracts; since for such a contract three things are essentially required: <ul><li>the consent of two parties to the same thing; <li>which imposes upon each an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; <li>so that the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of one party is the cause of a right in the other, and one <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is to the other as effect to cause.</ul>

<p>But a strict right arising from commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is altogether independent not only of the other contracting party, but also, generally speaking, of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">public authority</a>. Hence, no one can lawfully or validly take such a right away from me against my will. Moreover, it cannot be said that concordats impose on the pontiff an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> which is the cause of a right in the other party, and of such a right as can be neither lawfully nor validly recalled. For certainly, in this hypothesis, a succeeding pontiff could not do as much as his predecessor; he would receive a lessened power, not that which Peter received from Christ to be transmitted to his successors for the government of the church. And this surely cannot be, since each succeeding pontiff receives his power not from his dead predecessor, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself, who always gives the selfsame, as he has said once for all to Peter and his successors: "Thou art <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and upon this rock I will build my church . . . Feed my lambs . . . I will give to thee the keys". Therefore a succeeding pontiff is not bound by the compacts of his predecessor as by a bilateral contract giving such a strict right of commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that if he violate the agreement without cause his act is invalid. And neither is the pontiff who has made such compacts so bound by them, for he is not the master of that fullness of power which is the primacy, but only its administrator, so that he cannot alienate or lessen it. Nor can you argue that by concordats, which are bilateral contracts, not the power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a>, but only its exercise, is diminished. For what is that power which can never be exercised, or which, if exercised, remains without effect? And such would be the case, for even if the pontiff wished he could not act validly, and therefore his power would be lessened. And hence the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> must retain the fullness of power and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over those questions which are settled in a concordat. This is what <a href="../cathen/01583d.htm">Cardinal Antonelli</a>, Secretary of State, maintained in his diplomatic correspondence, when the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> complained that the pontiff had violated the concordat.

<p>Does the pontiff then contract no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in concordats? Assuredly he contracts an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>; and they do an injury to <a href="../cathen/14458c.htm">Cardinal Tarquini</a> who think that he held the opposite. For, although he does not mention this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in his definition of concordats, he certainly admits it when explaining his meaning. But this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is one of fidelity, not of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> which makes a violation of the concordat without just cause an unlawful act, but not an invalid act. <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">His Eminence Cardinal Francis Satolli</a> explains with his usual depth and clearness the nature of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> which a pontiff is under of observing a concordat. His little work, of great authority, bears the title, "Prima principiade Concordatis". The learned author begins his investigation with the following reasoning from <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, I, xxi, 1, ad 3. The <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a>, asking whether <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> exists in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, puts this objection to himself: The act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> consists in the payment of a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a debtor to no one, therefore it would seem that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not exist in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To solve this difficulty the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Holy Doctor</a> first lays down the principle: to every one is due what is his own. He then inquires what one may call his own, and establishes that one's own is that which is for him, as a slave is his master's, precisely because, inasmuch as he is a slave, he is for his master. In the name <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, therefore, concludes the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a>, is simplified a relation of exigency or necessity in a thing referring it to that for which it exists. Considering this relation more thoroughly, you will see that it is twofold: a relation by which a creature is for another creature and all creatures for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since this relation is twofold, there is also a twofold <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> in the Divine plan; one by which a thing is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other by which a thing is due to the creature, and in both ways, says St. Thomas, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can make payment. For it is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that what the wisdom of his will has decreed should be fulfilled in creatures, as it is due to the creature that what has been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for it it should possess. Thus it is due to man that other animals should supply his needs. But this second <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> depends on the first, since a thing is due to creatures because it is <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for them through the relations established by the Divine wisdom. Wherefore, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> pays a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> to his creatures in this way only, he does not become his creatures' debtor, but the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> always looks to His own propriety, and by it he renders to himself what is His due. The author then passes to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and applies to her this argument. For to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also is due that the mission of her <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> and holy teaching power and manifestation of the saving quality of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christ's religion</a> be accomplished in every State throughout the world. It is likewise due to the various States and their rulers that they have what is properly theirs. But this <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> depends on the first in every relation between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and a State; for it would be absurd were not all things ordered according to the relations established by the Divine wisdom, that is, to maintain religion, and to further the last end of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> pays in tending to her <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end is one of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but of a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which looks to the propriety of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself, that is of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which renders to itself what is its due. In purely temporal matters the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must observe the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> such as temporal matters require, for in these she is not a superior nor is her spiritual end in question. But in all matters which pertain to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, she can be under no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of strict <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> to the State, but rather her <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is to herself and to the spiritual purpose of her existence. And thus, generally speaking, she will be a debtor to States, through compact, since she owes to herself what her wisdom and never-failing desire for the spiritual good of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> has shown her to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p>But to present briefly what can certainly be said about concordats; concordats, as they have in fact often been agreed upon, often impose upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> towards the state. This happens when a concordat is concluded about purely temporal matters, for instance, when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cedes some of her temporal possessions, or when she renounces some temporal or historical right. Such was the case in the concordat concluded between <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> and the emperor, Ferdinand II, King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>; for in this instance the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ceded some <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> possessions upon receiving others from Ferdinand in compensation; such, too, was the concordat with Colombia, in 1887, art. 29. But we must bear in mind that in such concordats the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> follows the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common laws</a> of contracts; therefore, if a contract be extorted from him by <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> or intimidation, or if the matter of the concordat be illicit, he or his successor can annul that contract, and such action is quite licit and valid. Moreover, if the matter of the concordat is illicit, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is evidently <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to rescind the contract. Thus when Henry V had, by means of fear and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, urged Paschal II into certain points of agreement, this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> recalled those concessions in the First Council of the Lateran, on the 18th of March of the year 1112, because the entire council proclaimed that the concessions made to Henry were illicit&mdash;not a <em>privilegium</em>, but a <em>pravilegium</em>, as the council expressed it. Thus, too, if a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should make over to someone temporal possessions without a just cause, his successor can evidently cancel such a contract validly, because a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is only the administrator, and not the owner, of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> possessions.

<p>In concordats the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> often grants secular rulers real privileges and <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a>; for the pontiff expressly declares that he is granting an <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a>, a privilege &mdash; that he is conceding this or that particular point, that he is making such or such a concession, or granting a favour. Instances of this kind may be found in the concordat with the Two Sicilies, of the year 1741, c. viii, art. 1, in another with the Two Sicilies of 1818, art. 28, in a concordat with Costa Rica, of 1853, art. 7; in a concordat with Haiti, of 1860, art. 4; in a concordat with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, of 1855, art. 25; with <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, of 1863, art. 13, etc. Now if, as the "Corpus Juris Canonici", <em>regula juris</em> 16 in Sexto, has it, it is becoming that no favour granted by a sovereign should be recalled, it is fully evident from what we said above that this rule should hold good all the more when a privilege is granted in a form so solemn as that used in concordats; nor is it merely becoming for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> not to recall such concessions, but he has an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of observing those very articles which contain the privileges. This follows from what we said already, and this the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> themselves affirm, sometimes, indeed, in rather stringent terms. Nevertheless, from the explanations given above it is evident that these terms of affirmation must be understood to signify merely that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is binding himself in so far as he is capable of binding himself; but whilst, in such concordats, he can bind himself in fidelity, he cannot bind himself in commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; therefore, in those terms in which he affirms his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> he binds himself in fidelity, but not in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. And in fact, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have been much more scrupulously faithful in keeping these promises than the civil rulers themselves were, although the latter had taken upon themselves a real <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>In the second edition of his celebrated work "De Romano Pontifice" (Prato, 1891), Palmieri maintains that, even if concordats were strictly bilateral contracts, nevertheless the power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> over them would not be lessened on that account. But although Palmieri is quite justly acknowledged as easily the foremost authority on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, both on account of his universal experience and his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> acumen, nevertheless, in this case his position seems to be untenable. In the first edition of the same work (Rome, 1877) he maintained that concordats are not bilateral contracts in the strict sense of the term; and he bases his argument for the opinion laid down in the second edition on the supposition that the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a bilateral contract impedes, or renders illicit, any action of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against the provisions of the contract, but that, nevertheless, such action would still be valid. But this supposition is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, unless we use the term <em>bilateral contract</em> in its widest sense; but this would be a question about the meaning of words, and would not touch the point at issue. But if we really mean to use the term, <em>bilateral contract</em>, in its obvious meaning, we must certainly hold that such a contract renders any action against its provisions null and void. The learned author adduces two instances, taken from the contract of buying and selling and from the engagement to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, to prove his assertion; but neither of these two cases is to the point. For the engagement to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, as Palmieri himself admits, is a bilateral contract, consisting in the mutual promise of future marriage; and yet, if, for instance, the bridegroom marries some other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, his action is merely illicit, but not invalid. A sale of goods is likewise a bilateral contract, and it is completed only by handing over the article in question to the buyer; and yet, if the seller hands over to someone else the article that was already sold, the transfer of the article in question remains valid, even though the seller is bound to make good the damages caused to the first buyer. Therefore the two cases adduced by Palmieri prove nothing; for a bilateral contract renders invalid those actions merely which have the same subject-matter, and in so far only as they have the same subject-matter, as the contract itself. Thus it is evident that the engagement to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, being a bilateral contract, renders null and void any new espousals, because the subject-matter is the same; but it does not render invalid a marriage with some other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, because marriage is quite another kind of contract. The case is similar in the contract of buying and selling: even if the buyer and seller have agreed and concluded the sale, so long as no transfer has taken place, that contract does certainly not render the seller incapable of making a valid transfer of the goods in question to some other buyer; but it undoubtedly deprives the seller of the power of selling the goods validly a second time, unless the transfer of the goods follows the sale. (Cf. <a href="../cathen/09418b.htm">De Lugo</a>, "De justiti&acirc; et iure", disp. xxvi, 163 sqq.)

<p>So far we have been considering concordats in their relation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; the secular rulers on their part are bound in commutative <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by many articles of a concordat, unless an exception be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. But on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rulers all the articles of a concordat impose an additional <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of obedience; for, as <a href="../cathen/14458c.htm">Tarquini</a> testifies, a concordat may be rightly defined as "a particular ecclesiastical law for a certain country, enacted by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> at the request of the ruler of that country, and strengthened by the special <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, which that ruler takes upon himself, to observe its provisions forever."
<h3>Effect of concordats</h3>

<p>From all this it follows naturally that, since an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> devolves upon the contracting parties, the terms of the concordat should be faithfully carried out and rigidly adhered to. Neither party, then, may without consulting the other refuse, except for grave reasons, to abide by the terms agreed upon. Moreover, in view of the fact that concordats have the force of ecclesiastical laws, they at once annul all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and special customs that make for the contrary. All other <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> however, i.e. those which do not clash with the letter or spirit of the particular concordats, still hold; for concordats, barring of course those provisions which are especially mentioned, so far from making the <em>jus commune</em> inoperative, re-establish its validity. This is clear from the fact that the intention of the Sovereign Pontiff, when at the urgent request of a civil ruler he yields a point, or waives in certain cases the claims of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is obviously to insist on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of respecting and observing the ecclesiastical laws in all other details. Further, just as all other <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> when properly <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> bind the people, so concordats, inasmuch as they take on the form of civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are binding on the citizens of the country, and particularly the state officials; so much so that any infringement of them is equivalent to a violation of the civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. And rightly so, for concordats are <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> as <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> emanating from the power vested in the State as well as that in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The sovereign Pontiff gives publicity to the terms through his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> assembled in consistory, and through a special <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> through the customary channels, i.e. in the legal way in which other state <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> should and usually are <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>.
<h3>Interpretation and annulment of concordats</h3>

<p>Since it may very easily happen that from time to time a dispute or a disagreement may arise between the contracting parties as to the meaning that should be assigned to the articles agreed upon in the concordat, it seems advisable to determine how the controversy should be settled in the event of such a difficulty.

<p>In the first place there can be no question that every effort should be made to settle the dispute amicably, a precaution that is founded upon the motives that lead to the formation of a concordat &mdash; namely, that of terminating if not forestalling all disputes. Consequently, it would be in direct opposition to the nature of the concordat if it should itself prove a fresh reason for misunderstandings. Its very nature, then, makes it imperative that in the event of a disagreement arising touching the meaning to be attached to the concordat, the question should as far as possible be settled without any rupture of friendly relations; and assuredly the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never been found wanting in her efforts to further this end. This precaution, it should be added, has often been taken in framing the concordats themselves. For example, in the concordat drawn up by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> with the Emperor Francis Joseph I of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, in the year 1855, the following words were appended to art. 35: "Should, however, any difficulty arise in the future, His Holiness and His Imperial Majesty shall consult with each other that the question may be amicably decided." The very same words occur in the 13th art. of the concordat drawn up by the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with William I of <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, in the year 1857; so, too, in the 24th art. of that entered into by the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden in 1859; and again in the 24th art. of the concordat ratified with the President of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>. Other instances of a similar nature could be cited. Since this clause, once it is subjoined to a concordat, becomes a part of the agreement and consequently assumes the nature of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> as well as a <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, it must be kept to the letter, so long, of course, as it is normally possible to do so.

<p>True as all this is, it would be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> to maintain that both parties must concur in determining the meaning of a given clause or article. For he is the lawful interpreter who in the matter in question is the authoritative lawgiver. Now the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> always retains his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and legislative power over matters that are wholly or partially of a spiritual nature, nor can he transmit the power to another. Consequently, the Sovereign Pontiff always remains the authoritative interpreter. It is plain, then, that should a discussion arise, and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> refuse their consent to a reasonable adjustment, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in virtue of her higher judicial power, may exercise this right of annulling the concordat. It is clear, too, that, should the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at any time pledge herself in the event of some future misunderstanding to discuss the situation with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> in order to bring about an amicable settlement, such an act must be looked upon as supererogatory; for when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> waives any of her claims she makes a concession to the State, seeing that the highest community enjoys the right of settling a discussion even though the inferior body withholds its consent.

<p>It may be well to subjoin a few canons that shall serve as guides in interpreting the various articles of a concordat. Evidently, the meaning of those articles which import a bilateral or unilateral contract must be judged by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that determine the exact scope of contracts, while the meaning of clauses that bear upon the granting of a privilege must be decided by an appeal to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the interpretation of privileges. In its workings, however, the competent judge of a concordat is nowadays the Sacred Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. Far less, of course, is the State justified in rescinding concessions granted at the time the concordat was drawn up. For it frequently happens that the State promises to do only what it is already bound to by some pre-existing <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>; or at times the discussion turns on certain matters which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by virtue of the indirect power she has over the State, enjoins, or again on temporal affairs of which the State had handed over to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> full and absolute dominion. In the last case this forfeiture of dominion cannot be revoked, and for two reasons: first, because these gifts are usually compensatory for confiscated <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> &mdash; e.g., governments which had seized upon a considerable amount of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> have time and again promised in the concordats to endow <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, church fabrics, etc.&mdash;and secondly, because any gift once bestowed on an equal or a superior, even though it be purely gratuitous, may not be revoked, as such an act would be an exercise of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which it cannot employ except against a subject. All, however, acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may lawfully and justly refuse to abide by a concordat in all those circumstances which would permit or even <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> one to break a contract. Should there be question of privileges or <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> granted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a concordat, it follows <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> from what we have said that, given a just and adequate reason, they may validly and licitly be rescinded; if there be no reason, then such an action would still be valid, though not licit. It must be remembered, though, that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> exercise their authority only for the gravest reasons, and after all the solemn formalities of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> have been duly observed. Yet, should the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> rescind these privileges, he would not ordinarily be bound to make any compensation to the State, as compensation is strictly <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> only where the privileges revoked are those technically called <em>onerosa</em> (see <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">PRIVILEGE</a>). Concordats, however, are not of this nature. All this applies with greater force to concessions wrung from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> through chicanery, threats, or open <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, or which exceed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> prerogative. Again, if it is a question of dominion over temporal goods that has passed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the State, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is clear, may not revoke this concession, although a spontaneous grant may be withdrawn.
<h2>Summary of principal concordats</h2>
<h3>Before the eighteenth century</h3>

<p>(1) The Concordat of Worms, or <em>Pactum Calixtinum</em>, 23 September, 1122, between Pope <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Emperor Henry V</a>, confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/09016b.htm">First Lateran Council</a>, terminated the long investiture quarrel. The following were its chief provisions: <ul><li>The elections of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> should take place in the presence of the emperor. <li>Contested elections, according to one opinion, should be decided by the emperor, who had only to ask the advice of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and his suffragans; according to another opinion, the decision rested with the provincial synod, the emperor merely assuring the execution of the synod's judgment. <li>The emperor renounced the right of spiritual investiture with ring and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> and received instead the right of lay investiture with the sceptre, a sign of temporal, but not of spiritual, authority. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> should receive investiture with the sceptre before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, but in other countries after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. <li>The emperor promised to protect the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and restore the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> agreed not to disturb those who had been on the side of the emperor during the controversy.</ul>

<p>(2) Concordats with <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>: one in 1288 between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and King Diniz after a violent <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in that country, and ratified by <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> in 1289; another in 1516, between the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and King Manuel the Fortunate, afterwards confirmed by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a>.

<p>(3) The Concordat of 1516 between <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I of France</a>, confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a>, was a result of the long controversy between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the French Government over the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. Besides abolishing the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a>, the terms of this concordat; <ul><li>gave to the king the fight of presentation to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a>; <li>the concordat, however, maintained the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> right of confirmation, devolution (i.e. the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to appoint of his own choice, if the king did not present a candidate within the required time), and the reservation of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> made vacant by the death of the incumbents while at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court. <li>It contained also stipulations concerning the annates and other matters.</ul>

<p>(4) The Concordat of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> was the outcome of the efforts on the part of the princes of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> to put an end, at least in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, to the conflict between <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> and the Council of Basle. After some negotiations Eugene issued four <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> (Feb., 1447) which together constitute the so-called Concordat of the Princes. The first was a promise of a new council; the second contained a provisional acceptance of certain decrees of the Council of Basle; and the third and fourth dealt with the details of the agreement. <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> died shortly after this and <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, his successor, confirmed the four <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>. But a certain number of the princes being still unsatisfied, Frederick III thought it time to intervene. At a diet held at Aschaffenburg, he ordered the universal recognition of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> as lawful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and on 17 February, 1448, the Concordat of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> was agreed upon by the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, <a href="../cathen/03393c.htm">Carvajal</a>. It was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> on 19 March of the same year, and was subsequently recognized as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> code for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Its principal terms were the following:

<ul><li>The election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was to be free from all interference, though the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should have the right of confirmation; and for good reasons and with the advice of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> he could appoint a more worthy and suitable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> than the one elected; <li>In the six odd months of the year vacant <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> and non-elective <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> were at the disposal of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; at other times these vacancies should be filled by the ordinary. <li>The concordat also treated of the amount and payment of the annates.</ul>

<p>(5) The Concordat with <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> in 1630 was negotiated for that country between <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> and the Emperor Ferdinand II; it followed on the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> after the campaign directed by Ferdinand against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. By its terms the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> renounced the goods that had been alienated during the progress of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and received compensation from the revenues derived from a tax on salt which was levied for her benefit.
<h3>Eighteenth century</h3>

<p>Twelve concordats were made during the eighteenth century. Five of these with <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>: the first, in 1727, between <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Pope Benedict XIII</a> and Victor Amadeus II confirmed the right possessed by the House of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> of immediate <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices; three between <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> and King Charles Emmanuel III (1741, 1742, 1750); the fifth in 1770 between <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> and Charles Emmanuel III. Two were made with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, one in 1737 between <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> and Philip V, another in 1753 between <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> and King Ferdinand VI; one with the Two Sicilies in 1741, between <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> and Charles III; one with the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1757, between <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Empress Maria Teresa</a>; one with <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and Mantua in 1784, between <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>; one in 1778 with <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>; and one with <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1736 between <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> and King Augustus III.
<h3>Nineteenth century</h3>

<p>The following were the most important concordats of the nineteenth century:

<p>(1) The <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, to which a special article is devoted.

<p>(2) The concordat between Louis XVIII and <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> in 1817, intended to re-establish the Concordat of 1516, abrogate the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a>, and re-erect the suppressed <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, but never carried out.

<p>(3) The Concordat of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in 1817, concluded for <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and Maximilian Joseph by <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a> and Baron von H&ouml;ffelin. It dealt with the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, a new circumscription of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the erection of chapters, and especially nominations to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices. An addition made by the State, and bearing a relation to the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> concordat similar to that of the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, gave rise to much dispute.
