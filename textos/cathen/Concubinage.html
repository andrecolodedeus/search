<h1>Concubinage</h1>  

<p>At the present day, the state &#151; more or less permanent &#151; of a man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> living together in illicit intercourse. In its strict sense it is used of those unions only in which the man and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> are free from any <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> arising from a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, the state of matrimony or <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>, or the fact of relationship or affinity; it is immaterial whether the parties dwell together or not, the repetition or continuance of illicit relations between the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> being the essential element.

<p>However, the meaning conveyed by the term has not always been the same; in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, for instance, a legitimate spouse, if of an inferior social grade, or a bondwoman, is often given the appellation of concubine, not to call in question the validity of her marriage, but to indicate that she did not share in her husband's rank or <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> nor in the administration of the household to the same extent as the principal wife. From Genesis 21:9-14, we see that her dismissal and that of her children was permissible. But in those Scriptural times, when <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> was permitted or at least tolerated, such a concubine was not the only marriage partner. Thus Lia and Rachel, the first two spouses of Jacob, had the full social standing of wives, while Bala and Zelpha, both bondwomen, were his concubines, married for the purpose of bearing children for Rachel and Lia (<a href="../bible/gen030.htm#vrs3">Genesis 30:3, 9, 13</a>). Here, therefore, the main difference between the state of legitimate marriage properly so called and that of legitimate concubinage is to be found in the disparity of rank which characterized the latter.

<p>The meaning of the term in <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, and consequently in early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> records and writings, was much the same; a concubine was a quasi-wife, recognized by law if there was no legal wife. She was usually of a lower social grade than her husband, and her children, though not considered the equals of those of the legal wife (<em>uxor</em>) were nevertheless termed natural (<em>naturales</em>) to distinguish them from spurious offsprings (<em>spurii</em>). For this legitimate concubinage the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> did not require the intention of the two parties to remain together until death as man and wife; the <em>Lex Julia</em> and the <em>Papia Popp&aelig;a</em> allowing both temporary and permanent concubinage. The former was always condemned as immoral by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who excluded from the ranks of her <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> all who adopted this mode of living, unless they abandoned their illicit temporal, or converted it into lawful permanent, wedlock. Permanent concubinage, though it lacked the ordinary legal forms and was not recognized by the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> as a legal marriage, had in it no element of immorality. It was a real marriage, including the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> and <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of both parties to form a lifelong union. This the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> allowed from the beginning, while <a href="../cathen/03183d.htm">Pope Callistus I</a> broke through the barrier of state law, and raised to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a> permanent unions between slave and free, and even those between slave and slave (<em>contubernium</em>).

<p>The Council of Toledo, held in 400, in its seventeenth canon legislates as follows for <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> (for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> regulations on this head with regard to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> see <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">CELIBACY</a>): after pronouncing sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against any who in addition to a wife keep a concubine, it says: "But if a man has no wife, but a concubine instead of a wife, let him not be refused communion; only let him be content to be united with one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whether wife or concubine" (Can. "Is qui", dist. xxxiv; <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, III, col. 1001). The refractory are to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> until such time as they shall obey and do penance.

<p>With the destruction of the Roman Empire and the consequent decline of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, its institution of legitimate concubinage fell into disuse, and concubinage came more and more to have only the modern significance, that of a permanent illicit union, and as such was variously proceeded against by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">clandestine marriages</a> which gradually came to be tolerated in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, as they lacked the formality of a public sanction by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, can be considered as a species of legitimate concubinage. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1545-1563), Sess. XXIV, chap. i, not only renewed the old <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties against concubinage, but added fresh ones, also forbade and rendered null and void all <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">clandestine unions</a>, thus forever doing away with even the appearance of legitimate concubinage. From that time the modern invidious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the term alone obtains. The decrees of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, however, were in force only in countries strictly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; the new marriage law (Ne temere) of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (1908) extends the prohibition against <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">clandestine marriages</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the world over.
