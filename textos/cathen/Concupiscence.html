<h1>Concupiscence</h1>  

<p>In its widest acceptation, concupiscence is any yearning of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for good; in its strict and specific acceptation, a desire of the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> contrary to reason. To understand how the sensuous and the rational <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> can be opposed, it should be borne in mind that their natural objects are altogether different. The object of the former is the gratification of the senses; the object of the latter is the good of the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and consists in the subordination of reason to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, its supreme good and ultimate end. But the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> is of itself unrestrained, so as to pursue sensuous gratifications independently of the understanding and without regard to the good of the higher faculties. Hence desires contrary to the real good and order of reason may, and often do, rise in it, previous to the attention of the mind, and once risen, dispose the bodily organs to the pursuit and solicit the will to consent, while they more or less hinder reason from considering their lawfulness or unlawfulness. This is concupiscence in its strict and specific sense. As long, however, as deliberation is not completely impeded, the rational will is able to resist such desires and withhold consent, though it be not capable of crushing the effects they produce in the body, and though its freedom and dominion be to some extent diminished. If, in fact, the will resists, a struggle ensues, the sensuous <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> rebelliously demanding its gratification, reason, on the contrary, clinging to its own spiritual interests and asserting it control. "The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh."

<p>From the explanation given, it is plain that the opposition between <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> and reason is natural in man, and that, though it be an imperfection, it is not a corruption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Nor have the inordinate desires (actual concupiscence) or the proneness to them (habitual concupiscence) the nature of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, being the free and deliberate transgression of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, can be only in the rational will; though it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that they are <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, becoming the stronger and the more frequent the oftener they have been indulged. As thus far considered they are only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> objects and antecedent causes of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> transgressions; they contract the malice of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> only when consent is given by the will; not as though their nature were changed, but because they are adopted and completed by the will and so share its malice. Hence the distinction of concupiscence antecedent and concupiscence consequent to the consent of the will; the latter is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, the former is not. The first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were free from concupiscence, so that their sensuous <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> was perfectly subject to reason; and this freedom they were to transmit to posterity provided they observed the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A short but important statement of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on this point may be quoted from <a href="../cathen/11783c.htm">Peter the Deacon</a>, a Greek, who was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to bear witness to the Faith of the East: "Our <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is that Adam came from the hands of his Creator good and free from the assaults of the flesh" (Lib. de Incarn., c. vi). In our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a>, however, this complete dominion of reason over <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> was no natural perfection or acquirement, but a preternatural <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a>, that is, a gift not due to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; nor was it, on the other hand, the essence of their original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which consisted in <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>; it was but a complement added to the latter by the Divine bounty. By the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Adam freedom from concupiscence was forfeited not only for himself, but also for all his posterity with the exception of the Blessed Virgin by special privilege. Human nature was deprived of both its preternatural and <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> began to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> against the spirit, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> habits, contracted by personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wrought disorder in the body, obscured the mind, and weakened the power of the will, without, however, destroying its freedom. Hence that lamentable condition of which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> complains when he writes: <blockquote> I find then a law, that when I have a will to do good, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is present with me. For I am delighted with the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, according to the inward man: but I see another law in my members, fighting against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of my mind, and captivating me in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that is in my members. Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#vrs21">Romans 7:21-25</a>) </blockquote>

<p>Christ by His death redeemed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its bondage. In <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the guilt of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is wiped out and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is cleansed and justified again by the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. But freedom from concupiscence is not restored to man, any more than <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; abundant grace, however, is given him, by which he may obtain the victory over rebellious sense and deserve life everlasting.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> of the sixteenth century, especially <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, proposed new views respecting concupiscence. They adopted as fundamental to their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> the following propositions: <ul> <li>Original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> with all its gifts and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> was due to man as an integral part of his nature; <li>concupiscence is of itself <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, and being the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> corruption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> caused by Adam's transgression and inherited by all his descendants, is the very essence of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; <li><a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, since it does not extinguish concupiscence, does not really remit the guilt of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, but only effects that it is no longer imputed to man and no longer draws down condemnation on him. This position is held also by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> in its Thirty-nine Articles and its <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer.</a></ul> The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> condemns these doctrines as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. V, e.v.) defines that by the grace of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the guilt of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is completely remitted and does not merely cease to be imputed to man. As to concupiscence the council declares that it remains in those that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in order that they may struggle for the victory, but does no harm to those who resist it by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a>, and that it is called <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, not because it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> formally and in the proper sense, but because it sprang from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and incites to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Later on <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex omnibus affictionibus" (1 Oct., 1567), <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Provisions Nostrae" (29 Jan., 15798), <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "In eminenti" (6 March, 1641), condemned the propositions of Bajus (21, 23, 24, 26), <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, by the Constitution <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>, those of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> (34, 35); and finally <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Auctorem fidei" (28 Aug., 1794), those of the <a href="../cathen/12116c.htm">Synod of Pistoja</a> (16), which maintained that the gifts and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> bestowed on Adam and constituting his original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> were not <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> but due to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">GRACE</a>; <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">JUSTIFICATION</a>; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">SIN</a>.)
