<h1>Concursus</h1>  

<p>Concursus is a special competitive examination prescribed in canon law for all aspirants to certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices to which is attached the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>. There were no <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, properly speaking, during the first three hundred years of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>. A single church erected in the residential city of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the centre to which people living in city and country repaired on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and festivals to hear Mass, receive instruction, and approach the Sacraments. Gradual growth in church-membership called for the erection of additional churches to accommodate the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. In these churches sacred functions were conducted by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> residing at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was the only <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, exercised the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> throughout the diocese. A similar reason led to the organization of rural <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> during the course of the fourth century. With one or two exceptions, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were not organized in cities before the year 1000. The first step towards the establishment of city <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, was taken in the Council of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a> (1032). The amicable settlement of disputes involving a departure from the old regime paved the way for the organization of city <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was not slow in following the example of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. (Lupi, "De parochis ante annum Christi millesimum", <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, 1788; Muratori, "Dissert. de par&oelig;ciis et plebibus" in "Antiq. Ital.", VI, 359; Nardi, "Dei parrochi, opera di antichit&agrave; sacra", <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>, 1829-30; Drouyn, "L'histoire paroissiale" in "Rev. Cath.de Bordeaux", 1881, III, 233, and "Bull. hist. arch. du dioc. Dijon", 1887, V, 225; Zorell, "Die Entwickelung des Parochialsystems" in "Archiv f&uuml;r kath. Kirchenrecht", 1902-3.) Departures from traditional methods gradually took place in other countries until the organization of city and country <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> became general throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">PARISH</a>).

<p>The new regime paved the way for the admission of a general principle whereby <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, especially those of major importance, with <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> responsibility attached, were conferred on none save those duly qualified to hold them (see <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">BENEFICE</a>). Conscientious recognition of this principle was repeatedly inculcated, e.g. by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>. So long as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were not <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> absolutely, but for some specific office in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the canonical examinations for orders served naturally as a criterion to determine appointments to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. In time, however, this ancient method of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> fell into decay, and under <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1198-1216) separate examinations were inaugurated as the most satisfactory method of making appointments to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> that carried with them the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> (<em>beneficia curata</em>). In order to attain greater security in providing for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, ch. xviii) <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to assign to each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> a permanent <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his parishioners. The better to realize this design, the same council instituted the concursus, a competitive examination given to candidates seeking appointment as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of (canonical) <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. According to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> legislation, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> must designate a day for this examination. At the specified time, such as have signified their intention of undergoing this test are examined by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and by no less than three synodal examiners. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is required to appoint the one he judges most worthy among those passing a satisfactory examination.

<p>Though the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> regulations are quite clear, some canonists claimed that failure to observe them rendered appointments illicit, not invalid, while others held that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were not bound to appoint the most worthy candidate, but merely one passing a creditable examination. To dissipate such <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> issued the Constitution "In conferendis" (18 May, 1567). Later on, to forestall the possibility of groundless appeals on the part of dissatisfied competitors, as well as to ensure strict <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to candidates, <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> issued (18 Jan., 1721) a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> regarding the manner of conducting examinations, and the manner of dealing with those entering appeals against the decision of the examiners or the appointment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. However, <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI's</a> regulations occasioned various complaints, and to remedy these difficulties, as well as to complete <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation concerning the concursus, <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> issued the important Constitution, "Cum illud" (14 Dec., 1742). A survey of the various stages of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation on this question will naturally exhibit a fair summary of its leading points.

<p>In the first place, appointments to canonically erected <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are null when no concursus has been held, unless the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> legislation has been abrogated by long usage or special permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy see</a>. Questions and answers pertaining to a concursus must be committed to writing. The matter of the examination is taken from <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> (moral and dogmatic), liturgy, and ecclesiastical law, and is chiefly of a practical character. A Lesson in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> and a brief sermon may be prepared by the candidates. All competitors are examined in the same place and at the same time. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not justified in appointing simply a worthy competitor, but is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to choose the candidate he deems the most worthy among those approved by the examiners, whose office is exhausted when they have attested the worthiness (<em>idoneitas</em>) of the various competitors. The examiners, however, are bound to consider, not only the learning, but also the age, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, integrity, past services, and other qualifications of competitors. Candidates not appointed are at liberty to enter an appeal to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, and then to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but this does not suspend meanwhile the execution of the episcopal decision. The judge to whom such an appeal is made must base his decision on the proceedings of the concursus already held; this precludes a second concursus or the introduction of additional evidence. While this is the general ecclesiastical law, certain exceptions must be noted. This law does not cover appointments to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> where the incumbent is not permanently installed nor to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> whose revenues are not sufficient to justify such proceedings as a concursus involves. Nor, according to the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, is a concursus advisable when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, after hearing the advice of the synodal examiners, apprehends serious disorders in case a concursus were to take place.

<p>The Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1884) decreed that in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> one in every ten <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> should become a permanent rectorship. To inaugurate this plan, the council ruled that the establishment of such rectorships, and the appointment of incumbents thereunto should take place no later than three years after the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of its decrees. Bishops were allowed to name permanent rectors for the first time without a concursus, though they were required to seek the advice of their consultors. Thereafter the appointments of such rectors are null unless a concursus takes place. In a special case the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may waive the concursus in favour of an ecclesiastic whose learning is well known or whose services to religion are noteworthy, provided the advice of the synodal or pro-synodal examiners is taken. (Conc. Plen. Balt. III, ch. vi, nos. 40 sqq.) The method of conducting a concursus in this country is substantially the same as that prescribed by the general law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Candidates for admission to a concursus must have creditably exercised the ministry in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> no less than ten years, and, during that time, must have given evidence of ability to direct the temporal and spiritual affairs of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Bishops are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to appoint the most worthy of the competitors. Examiners should approve all worthy candidates. The right of determining the most worthy of those approved is vested in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Appeals and the method of treating them are subject to the general ecclesiastical law. Finally, where circumstances militate against the feasibility of a concursus as often as a permanent rectorship is to be filled, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has tolerated or allowed the holding, under the conditions already specified, of general annual examinations, to determine the standing of candidates in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, while judgment concerning the other <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> qualifications is given whenever a permanent rectorship is vacated. Those passing the examination once are counted worthy, in point of learning, for appointment to any permanent rectorship falling vacant within a given period, usually not more than six years, after such an examination. Should they wish to enjoy a like title after that period, success in another examination is required.

<p>Canada has no permanent rectorship. As a consequence, the manner of appointing rectors of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> is subject to the discretion of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. (Gignac, Comp. Juris eccl. ad usum cleri Canadensis, Quebec, 1901, De Personis, p. 355.) In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> no concursus is held to determine appointments to permanent rectorships (<a href="../cathen/14466a.htm">Taunton</a>, The Law of the Church, London, 1906, p. 231). According to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Synod of Maynooth held in 1900, legislation similar to that of the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> was adopted for determining appointments to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Since 1895 the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the concursus obtains also in the Commonwealth of Australia (Second Plen. Council of Australia, No. 47 sqq.). The acts of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and provincial councils, sessions of <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">papal conclaves</a> testify that the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> legislation concerning the concursus has long prevailed in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The same regulations were introduced into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in the sixteenth century; they obtain also in South America. While the observance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was general throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> before the middle of the seventeenth century, changed conditions long since led to its abrogation in that country (Duballet, Journal de droit canon., 1891, 452-74). In <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> the Synod of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> (1570) adopted the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> regulations, but since then, save for <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, the earlier freedom of episcopal collation has returned (<a href="../cathen/15354a.htm">Vering</a>, 471). At present, German, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a>, Hungarian, and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> base their appreciation of a candidate's learning on the results of general examinations at regular intervals. Exception being made for minor differences, the above-described regulations govern the examinations in those countries. The consideration of other <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> qualifications is made whenever a vacancy occurs and an appointment follows. While in other places <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may use their own discretion in appointing rectors, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> bespeaks even in such places all possible conformity to the spirit of the Tridentrne law. It may be added that in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, since <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, the State has insisted on the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> concursus, and has embodied it in art. 24 of the Concordat.
