<h1>Conflict of Investitures</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a> <em>Investiturstreit</em>.)

<p>The <em>terminus technicus</em> for the great struggle between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the German kings Henry IV and Henry V, during the period 1075-1122. The prohibition of investiture was in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> only the occasion of this conflict; the real issue, at least at the height of the contest, was whether the imperial or the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power was to be supreme in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. The powerful and ardent <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, sought in all earnestness to realize the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> on earth under the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. As successor of the Apostles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he claimed supreme authority in both spiritual and secular affairs. It seemed to this noble <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a> that the successor of Peter could never act otherwise than according to the dictates of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In this spirit he claimed for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> supremacy over emperor, kings, and princes. But during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> a rivalry had always existed between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the emperors, twin representatives, so to speak, of authority. Henry III, the father of the young king, had even reduced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> to complete submission, a situation which <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> now strove to reverse by crushing the imperial power and setting in its place the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. A long and bitter struggle was therefore unavoidable.

<p>It first arose through the prohibition of investitures, &agrave; propos of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms set afoot by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>. In 1074 he had renewed under heavier penalties the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and marriage of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but encountered at once great opposition from the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. To secure the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> influence in the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to set aside lay pretensions to the administration of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, and thus to break down the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> at the Lenten (Roman) Synod of 1075 withdrew "from the king the right of disposing of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in future, and relieved all <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay persons</a> of the investiture of churches". As early as the <a href="../cathen/12730a.htm">Synod of Reims</a> (1049) anti-investiture legislation had been enacted, but had never been enforced. Investiture at this period meant that on the death of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, the king was accustomed to select a successor and to bestow on him the ring and staff with the words: <em>Accipe ecclesiam</em> (accept this church). Henry III was wont to consider the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> fitness of the candidate; Henry IV, on the other hand, declared in 1073: "We have sold the churches". Since Otto the Great (936-72) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had been princes of the empire, had secured many privileges, and had become to a great extent <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lords over great districts of the imperial territory. The control of these great units of <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> and military power was for the king a question of primary importance, affecting as it did the foundations and even the existence of the imperial authority; in those days men had not yet learned to distinguish between the grant of the episcopal office and the grant of its temporalities (<em>regalia</em>). Thus minded, Henry IV held that it was impossible for him to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> prohibition of investiture. We must bear carefully in mind that in the given circumstances there was a certain justification for both parties: the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> object was to save the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the dangers that arose from the undue influence of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and especially of the king, in strictly <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs; the king, on the other hand, considered that he was contending for the indispensable means of civil government, apart from which his supreme authority was at that period inconceivable.

<p>Ignoring the prohibition of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, as also the latter's effort at a mitigation of the same, Henry continued to appoint <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Towards the end of December, 1075, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> delivered his ultimatum: the king was called upon to observe the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, as based on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and teachings of the Fathers; otherwise, at the following Lenten Synod, he would be not only "excommunicated until he had given proper satisfaction, but also deprived of his kingdom without hope of recovering it". Sharp reproval of his libertinism was added. If the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had given way somewhat too freely to his feelings, the king gave still freer vent to his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. At the Diet of Worms (January, 1076), <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, amid atrocious <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, was deposed by twenty-six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on the ground that his elevation was irregular, and that consequently he had never been <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Henry therefore addressed a letter to "Hildebrand, no longer <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> but a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>" : &mdash; "I, Henry, king by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a>, with all my <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> say to thee: 'Descend! Descend, thou ever accursed.'" If the king believed that such a deposition, which he was unable to enforce, was of any effect, he must have been very blind. At the next Lenten Synod in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1076) <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> sat in judgment upon the king, and in a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to Peter, Prince of the Apostles, declared: "I depose him from the government of the whole Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, release all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance, forbid him to be obeyed as king . . . and as thy successor bind him with the fetters of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>". It availed little that the king answered ban with ban. His domestic enemies, the Saxons and the lay princes of the empire, espoused the cause of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, while his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were divided in their allegiance, and the mass of his people deserted him. The age was yet too deeply conscious that there could be no <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> without communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The royal supporters grew ever fewer; in October a diet of the princes at Tribur <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> Henry to apologize humbly to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to promise for the future obedience and reparation, and to refrain from all actual government, seeing that he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>. They decreed also that if within a year and a day the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was not removed, Henry should forfeit his crown. Finally, they resolved that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should be invited to visit <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the following spring to settle the conflict between the king and the princes. Elated at this victory <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> set out immediately for the north.



<p>To the general astonishment, Henry now proposed to present himself as a penitent before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and thereby obtain pardon. He crossed Mont Cenis in the depth of winter and was soon at the Castle of <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a>, whither <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> had withdrawn on learning of the king's approach. Henry spent three days at the entrance to the fortress, barefoot and in the garb of a penitent. That he actually stood the whole time on ice and snow is of course a romantic exaggeration. He was finally admitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> presence, and pledged himself to recognize the mediation and decision of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the quarrel with the princes, and was then freed from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (January, 1077). This famous event has been countless times described, and from very divergent points of view. Through Bismarck, Canossa became a proverbial term to indicate the humiliation of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> before the ambitious and masterful Church. Recently, on the other hand, not a few have seen in it a glorious triumph for Henry. When the facts are carefully weighed, it will appear that in his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> capacity the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> yielded reluctantly and unwillingly, while, on the other hand, the political success of his concession was null. Henry had now the advantage, since, released from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, he was again free to act. Comparing, however, the power which thirty years earlier Henry III had exercised over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, we may yet agree with those historians who see in Canossa the acme of the career of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>.

<p>The German supporters of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ignored the reconciliation, and proceeded in March, 1077, to elect a new king, Rudolf of Rheinfelden. This was the signal for the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> during which <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> sought to act as arbiter between the rival kings and as their overlord to award the crown. By artful diplomacy Henry held off, until 1080, any decisive action. Considering his position sufficiently secure, he then demanded that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> his rival, otherwise he would set up an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> answered by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> and deposing Henry for the second time at the Lenten Synod of 1080. It was declared at the same time that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people should ignore all civil interference and all civil claims on <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, and should canonically elect all the candidates for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office. The effect of this second <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was inconsiderable. During the preceding years the king had collected a strong party; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> preferred to depend on the king rather than on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; moreover, it was believed that the second <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was not justified. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory's</a> party was thus greatly weakened, At the Synod of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a> (June, 1080) the king's <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> listened to ridiculous charges and exaggerations, and deposed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, and elected as <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert, Archbishop of Ravenna</a>, otherwise a learned and blameless man. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> had relied on the support of the Normans in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and of the German enemies of the king, but the former sent him assistance. Thus when in October, 1080, his rival for the throne was slain in battle, Henry turned his thoughts on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> capital. Four times, from 1081 to 1084, he assaulted <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1083 captured the Leonine City, and in 1084, after an unsuccessful attempt at a compromise, gained possession of the entire city.

<p>The deposition of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and the election of <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a>, who now called himself <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a>, was confirmed by a synod, and in March, 1084, Henry was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor by his <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. The Normans arrived too late to prevent these events, and moreover proceeded to plunder the town so mercilessly that <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> lost the allegiance of the Romans and was compelled to withdraw southward with his Norman allies. He had suffered a complete defeat, and died at <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a> (25 May, 1085), after another ineffectual renewal of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against his opponents. Though he died amid disappointment and failure, he had done indispensable pioneer work and set in motion forces and principles that were to dominate succeeding centuries.

<p>There was now much confusion on all sides. In 1081 a new rival for the crown, the insignificant Count Herman of Salm, had been chosen, but he died in 1088. Most of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> held with the king, and were thus <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>; in Saxony only was the Gregorian party dominant. Many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> had two occupants. Both parties called their rivals <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjurers</a> and traitors, nor did either side discriminate nicely in the choice and use of weapons. Negotiations met with no success, while the synod of the Gregorians at Quedlinburg (April, 1085) showed no inclination to modify the principles which they represented. The king, therefore, resolved to crush his rivals by force. At the Council of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (April, 1085) fifteen Gregorian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were deposed, and their sees entrusted to adherents of the royal party. A fresh rebellion of the Saxons and Bavarians forced the king's <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to fly, but the death of the most eminent and a general inclination towards peace led to a truce, so that about 1090 the empire entered on an interval of peace, far different, however, from what Henry had contemplated. The Gregorian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> recognized the king, who consequently withdrew his support from his own nominees. But the truce was a purely political one; in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters the opposition continued unabated, and recognition of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> was not to be thought of. Indeed, the political tranquillity served only to bring out more definitely the hopeless antithesis between the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who held with <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and those who sided with the king.

<p>There are yet extant numerous contemporary polemical treatises that enable us to follow the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> of opinions after 1080 (of the preceding period few such documents remain). These writings, usually short and acrimonious, were widely scattered, were read privately or publicly, and were distributed on court and market-days. They are now collected as the "Libelli de lite imperatorum et pontificum", and are to be found in the Monumenta Germani&aelig; historica". It is but natural that the principles advocated in these writings should be diametrically opposed to one another. The writers of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory's</a> party maintain that unconditional obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and that, even when <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is valid. The king's writers, on the other hand, declare that their master is above responsibility for his actions, being the representative of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on earth, and as such overlord of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Prominent on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> side were the unbending Saxon Bernhard, who would hear of no compromise and preferred death to violation of the canons, the Swabian Bernold of St. Blasien, author of numerous but unimportant letters and memorials, and the rude, fanatical Manegold of Lautenbach, for whom obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was the supreme <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and who maintained that the people could depose a bad ruler as rightfully as one would dismiss a swineherd who had failed to protect the drove entrusted to his care. On the side of the king stood <a href="../cathen/15588a.htm">Wenrich of Trier</a>, calm in diction, but resolute, Wido of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, a solid writer, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose heart was set on peace between the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but who opposed <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> for having unlawfully <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the king and for inducing the latter's feudatories to break their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance.

<p>On the royal side, also, was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Hersfeld, otherwise unknown, who reveals a clear grasp of the real issue in his pamphlet "De unitate ecclesi&aelig;", wherein he indicates the matter of supremacy as the real source of the conflict. Monarchy, he said, comes directly from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; consequently, to Him alone is the king responsible. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on the other hand, is the totality of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, united in one <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> by the spirit of peace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he goes on, is not called to exercise temporal authority; she bears only the spiritual sword, that is, the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Here, however, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> went far beyond the age in which he lived. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the adherents of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> outmatched their rivals intellectually. Among their number was <a href="../cathen/02673a.htm">Bonizo of Sutri</a>, the historian of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> side, a valuable writer for the preceding decades of the conflict, naturally from the standpoint of the pontiff and his adherents. Anselm, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, and Cardinal Deusdedit, at <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory's</a> request, compiled collections of canons, whence in later times the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> drew substantial support. To the royal party belonged the vacillating Cardinal Beno, the personal enemy of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and author of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> pamphlets against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, also the mendacious Benzo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Alba, for whom, as for most courtiers, the king was answerable only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was the king's vassal. Guido of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> held more temperate opinions, and endeavoured to persuade the moderate Gregorians to adopt a policy of compromise. Petrus Crassus, the only <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> engaged in the controversy, represented the youthful <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> and strongly advocated the autonomy of the State, maintaining that, as the sovereign authority was from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it was a crime to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon the king. He claimed for the king all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Roman emperors, consequently the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to sit in judgment on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>In 1086 <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> was succeeded by a milder character, <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Victor III</a>, who had no desire to compete for the supreme authority, and drew back to the position that the whole strife was purely a question of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration. He died in 1087, and the contest entered on a new period with <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> (1088-99). He shared fully all the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, but endeavoured to conciliate the king and his party and to facilitate their return to the views of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> party. Henry might perhaps have come to some arrangement with Victor, had he been willing to set aside the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, but he clung closely to the man from whom he had received the imperial crown. In this way <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> soon broke out again, during which the cause of the king suffered a decline. The <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope's</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> gradually deserted him in answer to <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban's</a> advantageous offers of reconciliation; the royal authority in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> disappeared, while in the defection of his son Conrad and of his second wife Henry suffered an additional humiliation. The new crusading movement, on the other hand, rallied many to the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. In 1094 and 1095 <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban</a> renewed the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of Henry, <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a>, and their supporters. When the <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">pope</a> died (1099), followed by the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> (1100), the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, so far as <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters were concerned, had won a complete victory. The subsequent <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibertian</a> party in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were of no importance. <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban</a> was succeeded by a less able ruler, Paschal II (1099-1118), whom Henry at first inclined to recognize. The political horizon meanwhile began to look more favourable for the king, who was now universally acknowledged in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He was anxious to secure in addition <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> peace, sought to procure the removal of his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, and publicly declared his intention of making a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Sepulchre. This, however, did not satisfy the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who demanded the renunciation of the right of investiture, still obstinately claimed by Henry. In 1102 Paschal renewed the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against the emperor. The revolt of his son (Henry V), and the latter's alliance with the princes who were dissatisfied with the imperial policy, brought matters to a crisis and occasioned the greatest suffering to the sorely tried emperor, who was now ignominiously outwitted and overcome by his son. A decisive struggle was rendered unnecessary by the death of Henry IV in 1106. He had untiringly defended the inherited <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the royal office, and had never sacrificed any of them.

<p>From the beginning Henry V had enjoyed the support of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who had relieved him of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and had set aside his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. At and after the Pentecost Synod of Nordhausen, in 1105, the king dispelled the last remnants of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> by deposing the imperial occupants of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>. The questions, however, which lay at the root of the whole conflict were not yet decided, and time soon showed that, in the matter of investitures, Henry was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heir of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> policy. Cold, calculating, and ambitious, the new monarch had no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of withdrawing the royal claims in this respect. Notwithstanding repeated prohibitions (at <a href="../cathen/07053b.htm">Guastalla</a> in 1106, and at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> in 1107), he continued to invest with ostentation the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his choice. The German <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> raised no protest, and made it evident in this way that their earlier refusal of obedience to the emperor arose from the fact of his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, not from any resentment occasioned by his interference in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1108 <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was pronounced upon the giver and receiver (<em>dans et accipiens</em>) of investiture, and thus affected the king himself. As Henry had now set his heart on being <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor, this decision precipitated the final struggle. In 1111 the king marched with a strong army on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Eager to avoid another conflict, Paschal attempted a radical solution of the question at issue; the German <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, he decided, were to restore to the king all their estates and privileges and to maintain themselves on <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and donations; under these circumstances the monarchy, which was interested only in the overlordship of these domains, might easily dispense with the investiture of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. On this understanding peace was established at Sutri between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and king. Paschal, who had been a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> before his elevation, undoubtedly executed in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> this renunciation of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was but a short step to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was a spiritual institution, and as such had no concern with earthly affairs.

<p>The king, however, cannot have <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> for a moment that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> renunciation would fall before the opposition of both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular princes. Henry V was mean and deceitful, and sought to entrap the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The king having renounced his claim to investiture, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in St. Peter's on 12 February, 1112, the return of all temporalities to the Crown, but thereby raised (as Henry had foreseen) such a storm of opposition from the German princes that he was forced to recognize the futility of this attempt at settlement. The king then demanded that the right of investiture be restored, and that he should be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor; on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> refusal, he treacherously seized him and thirteen <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and hurried them away from the now infuriated city. To regain his freedom, Paschal was forced, after two months <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, to accede to Henry's demands. He granted the king unconditional investiture as an imperial privilege, <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him emperor, and promised on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> not to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> him for what had occurred.

<p>Henry had thus secured by force a notable success, but it could have no long duration. The more ardent members of the Gregorian party rebuked the "heretical" <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and compelled him to retire step by step from the position into which he had been forced. The Lateran Synod of 1112 renewed the decrees of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban</a> against investiture. Paschal did not wish to withdraw his promise directly, but the Council of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, having declared the imperial <em>privilegium</em> (privilege, derivatively, a private law) a <em>pravilegium</em> (a vicious law), and as such null and void, it also <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the emperor. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not, however, break off all intercourse with Henry, for whom the struggle began to assume a threatening aspect, since now, as previously under his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, the difficulties raised by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> opposition were aggravated by rebellion of the princes. The inconsiderate selfishness of the emperor, his mean and odious <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, made enemies on every side. Even his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> now opposed him, seeing themselves threatened by him and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> him set on sole mastery. In 1114 at <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, and in 1116 at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Goslar, and a second time at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the emperor was repeated by <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>. Imperial and irresolute <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who refused to join the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> party, were removed from their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The emperor's forces were defeated simultaneously on the Rhine and in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>. In 1116 Henry attempted to enter into negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but no agreement was arrived at, as on this occasion Paschal refused to enter into a conference with the emperor.

<p>After Paschal's death (1118) even his tolerant successor, Gelasius II (1118-19), could not prevent the situation from becoming daily more entangled. Having demanded recognition of the privilege of 1111 and been referred by Gelasius to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, Henry made a hopeless attempt to revive the universally detested <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> by appointing as <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, under the name of <a href="../cathen/06795b.htm">Gregory VIII</a>, Burdinus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (Portugal), and was accordingly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In 1119 Gelasius was succeeded by Guido of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> as <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> (1119-24); he had already <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the emperor in 1112. Reconciliation seemed, therefore, more remote than ever. Callistus, however, regarded the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as of prime importance, and as the emperor, already on better terms with the German princes, was likewise eager for peace, negotiations were opened. A basis for compromise lay in the distinction between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and the secular elements in the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This mode of settlement had already been discussed in various forms in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, e.g. by <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Ivo of Chartres</a>, as early as 1099. The bestowal of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office was sharply distinguished from the investiture with imperial domains. As symbols of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> installation, the ring and staff were suggested; the sceptre served as the symbol of investiture with the temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The chronological order of the formalities raised a new difficulty; on the imperial side it was demanded that investiture with the temporalities should precede <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> representatives naturally claimed that <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> should precede investiture. If the investiture were to precede, the emperor by refusing the temporalities could prevent <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; in the other case, investiture was merely a confirmation of the appointment. By 1119 the articles of peace were agreed upon at Mouzon and were to be ratified by the <a href="../cathen/12730a.htm">Synod of Reims</a>. At the last moment, however, negotiations were broken off, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> renewed the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the emperor. But the German princes succeeded in reopening the proceedings, and peace was finally arranged between the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the emperor and the princes on 23 September, 1122. This peace is usually known as the Concordat of Worms, or the "Pactum Calixtinum".

<p>In the document of peace, Henry yields up "to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his Holy Apostles Peter and Paul and to the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> all investitures with ring and staff, and allows in all Churches of his kingdom and empire <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> election and free <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>". On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> grants to "his beloved son Henry, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Grace of God</a> Roman Emperor, that the election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> in so far as they belong to the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, shall take place in his presence, without <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> or the employment of any constraint. Should any discord arise between the parties, the emperor shall, after hearing the advice and verdict of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province lend his approval and support to the better side. The elected candidate shall receive from him the temporalities (<em>regalia</em>) with the sceptre, and shall discharge all <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> entailed by such reception. In other portions of the empire, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> candidate shall within six months receive the <em>regalia</em> by means of the sceptre, and shall fulfil towards him the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> implied by this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. From these arrangements is excepted all that belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>" (i.e. the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>). The different parts of the empire were therefore differently treated; in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the investiture was to precede the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, while in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> it followed the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> and within the succeeding six months. The king was deprived of his unrestricted power in the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also failed to secure the full exclusion of every alien influence from canonical elections. The Concordat of Worms was a compromise, in which each party made concessions. Important for the king were the toleration of his presence at the election (<em>pr&oelig;sentia regis</em>), which lent him a possible influence over the electors, and of investiture before <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, whereby the elevation of an obnoxious candidate was rendered difficult or even impossible. The extreme <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> party, who condemned investitures and secular influence in elections under any form, were dissatisfied with these concessions from the very outset and would have been highly pleased, if Callistus had refused to confirm the Concordat.

<p>In appraising the significance of this agreement it remains to be seen whether it was intended as a temporary truce or an enduring peace. <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">Doubts</a> might very well be (and indeed have been) entertained on this matter, since formally the document is drawn up only for Henry V. But a close examination of our sources of information and of contemporary documents has shown that it is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> to maintain that the Concordat enjoyed but a passing recognition and was of small importance. Not only by the contracting parties, but also by their contemporaries, the compact was regarded as an enduring fundamental law. It was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> recognized not only as an imperial statute, but as a law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the Lateran &OElig;cumenical Council of 1123. We also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from <a href="../cathen/06472a.htm">Gerhoh of Reichersberg</a>, who was present at the council, that in addition to the imperial document, which it has been held was alone read, that of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was also read and sanctioned. As <a href="../cathen/06472a.htm">Gerhoh</a> was one of the chief opponents of the Concordat, his evidence in favour of an unpleasant <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. That the agreement was to possess perpetual binding power, neither party, of course, intended &mdash; and the Concordat was very far from securing such continued recognition, since it reveals at most the anxiety of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for peace, under the pressure of certain circumstances. By new legislative act the provisions were modified. Under King Lothair (1125-37) and at the beginning of the reign of Conrad III (1138-52) the Concordat was still unchallenged and was observed in its entirety. In 1139, however, <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, in the twenty-eighth canon of the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, confined the privilege of electing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter and the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and made no mention of lay participation in the election. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> party assumed that this provision annulled the king's participation in elections and his right to decide in the case of an equally divided vote of the electors. If their opinion was correct, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone had withdrawn on this point from the compact, and the kings had no need to take cognizance of the fact. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the latter retained their right in this respect, though they used it sparingly, and frequently waived it. They had ample opportunity to make their influence felt in other ways. <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick I</a> (1152-90) was again complete master of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and was generally able to secure the election of the candidate he favoured. In case of disagreement he took a bold stand and compelled the recognition of his candidate. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1198-1216) was the first to succeed in introducing free and canonical election into the German Church. Royal investiture after his time was an empty survival, a <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> without meaning.

<p>Such was the course and the consequence of the investiture conflict in the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the strife never assumed the same proportions nor the same bitterness. It was owing to the importance of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> and the imperial power that they had in the first instance to bear the brunt of the fight. Had they suffered defeat, the others could never have engaged in the contest with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2>The conflict in England</h2>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the conflict is part of the history of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Anselm of Canterbury</a>. As <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1093-1109), he fought almost singlehanded for the canon law against king nobility and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. William the Conqueror (1066-87) had constituted himself sovereign lord of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; he ratified the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, determined how far the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should be recognized, and forbade all intercourse without his permission. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was therefore practically a national Church, in spite of its nominal dependence on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Anselm's contest with William II (1087-1100) was concerned with other matters, but during his residence in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he was one of the supporters of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform, and, being required on his return to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fealty to the new king (Henry I, 1100-35) and receive the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> from his hands, he refused to comply. This led to the outbreak of the investiture quarrel. The king despatched successive embassies to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to uphold his right to investiture, but without success. In his replies to the king and in his letters to Anselm, Paschal strictly forbade both the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fealty and all investitures by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. Henry then forbade Anselm, who was visiting <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and seized his revenues, whereupon, in 1105, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the councillors of the king and all <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who received investiture at his hands. In the same year, however, an agreement was arrived at, and was ratified by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1106, and by the Parliament in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1107. According to this concordat the king renounced his claims to investiture, but the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fealty was still exacted. In the appointment of the higher dignitaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, the king still retained the greatest influence. The election took place in the royal palace, and, whenever a candidate obnoxious to the king was proposed, he simply proposed another, who was then always elected. The chosen candidate thereupon <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fealty, which always preceded the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The separation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office from the bestowal of the temporalities was the sole object attained, an achievement of no very great importance.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the question of investiture was not of such importance for the State as to give rise to any violent contention. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had neither such power nor such extensive domains as in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and but a certain number of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were invested by the king, while many others were appointed and invested by the nobles of the kingdom, the counts and the dukes (i.e. for the so-called mediate <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>). The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> were often dealt with in a very arbitrary manner, being frequently sold, presented as a gift, and bestowed upon kinsmen. After the reconciliation between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and king, in 1104, the right of appointment was tacitly renounced by the kings, and free election became the established rule. The king retained, however, the right of ratification, and exacted, usually after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fealty from the candidate before he entered on the use of the temporalities. After some minor conflicts, these conditions were extended to the mediate <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. In some cases, e.g. in Gascony and Aquitaine, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> entered into immediate possession of the temporalities on the ratification of his election. It was in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, therefore, that the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were most completely fulfilled.
