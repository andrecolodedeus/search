<h1>Confraternities of the Cord</h1>  

<p>Pious associations of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, the members of which wear a cord or <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, to keep in mind some special grace or favour which they hope to obtain through his intercession. Among Oriental peoples, and especially among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> wore a <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, the wearing of a belt or girdle dates back to very ancient times. Christ himself commanded his Apostles to have their loins girded. In the early Church virgins wore a <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a> as a sign and emblem of purity, and hence it has always been considered a symbol of chastity as well as of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. The wearing of a cord or <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a saint is of very ancient origin, and we find the first mention of it in the life of St. Monica. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cinctures</a> were also worn by the faithful in honour of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, though no confraternities were formally established, and the wearing of a <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a> was general throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Later on, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority set apart special formulae for the blessing of <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cinctures</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Most Precious Blood, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, St. Francis of Paul, and <a href="../cathen/12025b.htm">St. Philomena</a>. There are in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> three archconfraternities and one confraternity the members of which wear a cord or <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>.
<h2 id="section1">The Archconfraternity of Our Lady of Consolation, or of the Black Leathern Belt of St. Monica, St. Augustine, and St. Nicholas of Tolentino</h2>

<p>According to an old tradition, St. Monica in a vision received a black leathern belt from the Blessed Virgin, who assured the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> that she would take under her special protection all those who wore it in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. St. Monica related this vision to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> and St. Simplicianus; both <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> put on a leathern belt, and St. Ambrose is said to have girded St. Augustine with it at his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Later on it was adopted by the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a> as a distinctive part of their habit. When, after the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="../cathen/11065a.htm">St. Nicholas of Tolentino</a>, it came into general use among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> in 1439 erected the Confraternity of the Cincture of St. Monica, St. Augustine, and <a href="../cathen/11065a.htm">St. Nicholas of Tolentino</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. James at Bologna. In 1590 Thaddeus of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, General of the Augustinians, united this confraternity and that of Our Lady of Consolation (founded in 1318 or, according to others, in 1495) into one confraternity, which union was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ad ea" (15 July, 1575). The same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> raised this confraternity to the rank of an archconfraternity and enriched it with many <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>. He further <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that all confraternities of the black leathern belt should be aggregated to the archconfraternity at Bologna, in order to share its privileges and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>. The principal feast of this confraternity is the Sunday within the octave of the feast of St. Augustine (28 August). The members are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to wear a black leathern belt, to recite daily thirteen Paters and Aves and the <a href="../cathen/13409a.htm">Salve Regina</a>, and to fast on the vigil of the feast of St. Augustine. For the erection of and reception into this archconfraternity special faculties must be had from the general of the Sugustinians.
<h2 id="section2">Archconfraternity of the Cord of St. Francis</h2>

<p>After his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> St. Francis girded himself with a rough cord in memory of the cords with which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had been bound during His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, and a white girdle with three knots cam subsequently to form part of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> habit. According to <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a>, <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> received the cord from St. Francis and always wore it under his habit out of devotion to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, his example being followed by many of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. In his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex supernae dispositionis" (19 November, 1585), <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> erected the Archconfraternity of the Cord of St. Francis in the basilica of the Sacro Convento at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, enriching it with many <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>, and conferred upon the minister general of the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> the power of erecting confraternities of the Cord of St. Francis in the churches of his own order and of aggregating them to the archconfraternity at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>. The same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Divinae caritatis" (29 August, 1587), granted new <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> to the archconfraternity and empowered the minister general of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> to erect confraternities of the Cord of St. Francis in the churches of his own order in those places where they are no <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>. <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Cum certas" (2 March, 1607), and "Nuper archiconfraternitati" (11 March, 1607) revoked all spiritual favours hitherto conceded to the archconfraternity and enriched it with new and more ample <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>. Both these <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> were confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, "Dudum felicis" (13 July, 1673). Finally, <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> in his Constitution "Sacrosancti apostolatus" (30 September, 1724), conceded to the minister general of the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> authority to erect confraternities of the Cord of St. Francis in churches not belonging to his own order in those places where there are no <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. New privileges and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> were conceded to the archconfraternity by two decrees of the Sacred Congregation of Indulgences <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 March, 1879, and 26 May, 1883. Besides the ordinary requirements <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the gaining of all plenary and partial <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>, the wearing of the cord and enrollment in the records of the archconfraternity are the only conditions imposed on the members.
<h2 id="section3">Archconfraternity of the Cord of St. Joseph</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cure of an Augustinian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in 1657 from a grievous illness, through the wearing of a cord in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Joseph gave rise to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> practice of wearing it to obtain the grace of purity through his intercession. The devotion soon spread over many countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and in the last century was revived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the church of San Rocco and in that of San Nicolo at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 19 September, 1859, approved a special formula for the blessing of the Cord of St. Joseph, and in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Expositum nobis nuper" (14 March, 1862) enriched the confraternity with many <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. In 1860 several new <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> were granted to the confraternity erected in the church of San Nicolo at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Universi Dominici gregis", 23 September, 1862, the Confraternity of the Cord of St. Joseph was raised to an archconfraternity. The members are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to wear a cord having seven knots, and are exhorted to recite daily seven Glorias in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Joseph. Confraternities of the Cord of St. Joseph much be aggregated to the archconfraternity in the church of San Rocco at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in order to enjoy its spiritual favours and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Confraternity of the Cord of St. Thomas</h2>

<p>It is related in the life of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> that, as a reward for his overcoming a temptation against purity, he was girded with a cord by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and that in consequence he was never again tempted against this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. This cord is still preserved in the church at Chieri near <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. Soon after the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> death many of the faithful began to wear a cord in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, to obtain the grace of purity through his intercession. In the seventeenth century <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> were formed at different <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, the student members of which wore a cord in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Thomas, hoping through his intercession to be protected from the dangers to which youth is generally exposed. The first Confraternity of the Cord of St. Thomas was erected at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Francis Deuwerders, and numbered among its members all the professors and students of the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and many of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Thence it spread to Maastricht, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and many other cities of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> sanctioned this new confraternity by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 March, 1652. The members are required to have their names enrolled, to wear a cord with fifteen knots, and to recite daily fifteen Ave Marias in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Thomas. For the erection of and reception into this confraternity special faculties must be had from the superior general of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> and privileges are contained in the great <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, "Pretiosus" (26 April, 1727, sect. 9) and in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Indulgences (8 May, 1844). (See <a href="../cathen/01692a.htm">ARCHCONFRATERNITY</a>.)
