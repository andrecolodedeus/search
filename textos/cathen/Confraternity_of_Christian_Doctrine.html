<h1>Confraternity of Christian Doctrine</h1>  

<p>An association established at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1562 for the purpose of giving <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> instruction. Till about the thirteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> and <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Paternoster</a> formed the general basis of religious instruction; all the faithful had to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by heart, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were commanded to explain them on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and festivals. Then the range of instruction was widened to include the Commandments and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the virtues and vices. The Synod of Lambeth under Archbishop Peekham, in 1281, was content to order <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to explain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> four times year, but the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Lavour, in 1368, commanded <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to give instruction on all <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast days. This council also published a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> to serve as a textbook for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in giving instructions in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, which was followed in all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Languedoc and Gascony. Similar manuals were published elsewhere. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, seeing how multitudes had fallen from the Faith through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of their religion and recognizing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> proclaimed by <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> more than a century before, that church reform must begin with the religious instruction of the young, issued the "Catechismus ad Parochos", and decreed that throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> instructions in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> should be given on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and festivals.

<p>But the work of organizing religious instruction had already begun. In 1536 the Abbate Castellino da Castello had inaugurated a system of Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. About 1560 a wealthy <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> nobleman, Marco de Sadis-Cusani, having established himself in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was joined by a number of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> associates, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, pledged to instruct both children and adults in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pope Pius IV</a> in 1562 made the church of Sant' Apollinare their central institution; but they also gave instructions in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, in the streets and lanes, and even in private houses. The association growing, it divided into two sections: the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> formed themselves into a religious congregation, "The Fathers of Christian Doctrine", while the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> remained in the world as "The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine". Encouragement from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was quickly forthcoming. In 1571, <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope St. Pius V</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Ex debito pastoralis officii", bore witness to the good already accomplished, and recommended <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to establish it in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Ex credito nobis", in 1607, erected it into an archconfraternity, with St. Peter's, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as its head centre. A <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Indulgences, in 1686, urged its establishment wherever possible. From <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> it spread rapidly over <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. It found advocates in Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, St. Francis of Sales, and <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>; who drew up a code of rules and established it in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>The First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Westminster urged that its members should be used in both Sunday and day-schools, but while Sunday-schools are plentiful, the confraternity is only sparsely established in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Lastly, in 1905 <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> strictly <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that "in each and every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> commonly called the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine shall be canonically erected". If the central confraternity in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is affiliated to the Archconfraternity of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> del Pianto in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, all others participate in all the confraternity <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.

<p>Similar in scope and character to the above are the PIEUSES UNIONS DE LA DOCTRlNE CHR&Eacute;TIENNE, founded by the <em>Dames de l'Adoration Perpetuelle</em> at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1851, for giving religious instruction to boys and girls. In <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> they are found in about thirty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. In 1894 <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> erected it into an archconfraternity for <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>.

<p>THE ARCHCONFRATERNITY OF VOLUNTARY CATECHISTS (Oeuvre des Cat&eacute;chismes) was founded to help <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in giving religious instructions to children attending the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and other parts of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, after these had been laicized. In 1893 <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> gave it the rank of an archconfraternity with power to affiliate all similar confraternities in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> granted to all these confraternities are very numerous.
