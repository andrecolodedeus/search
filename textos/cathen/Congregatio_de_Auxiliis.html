<h1>Congregatio de Auxiliis</h1>  

<p>A commission established by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> to settle the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversy regarding grace which arose between the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> towards the close of the sixteenth century. Vast as was the subject of that controversy, its principle question, and the one that gave its name to the whole dispute, concerned the help (<em>auxilia</em>) afforded by grace; while the crucial point was the reconciliation of the efficacy of grace with human freedom. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> on the one hand that the efficacious grace given for the performance of an action obtains, infallibly, man's consent and that action takes place. On the other hand it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that in so acting, man is free. Hence the question: How can these two things--the infallible result and liberty--be harmonized? The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> solved the difficulty by their theory of physical premotion and predetermination; grace is efficacious when, in addition to the assistance <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for an action, it gives a physical impulsion by means of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> determines and applies our faculties to the action. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> found the explanation in that mediate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>scientia media</em>) whereby <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows, in the objective reality of things what a man, in any circumstances in which he might be placed, would do. Foreseeing, for instance, that a man would correspond freely with grace A, and that he, freely, would not correspond with grace B, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, desirous of man's conversion, gives him grace A. This is efficacious grace. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> declared that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> conceded too much to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and so tended toward <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>. In turn, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> complained that the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> did not sufficiently safeguard human liberty, and seemed in consequence to lean towards <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>.

<p>The controversy is usually supposed to have begun in the year 1581, when the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Prudencio de Montemayor defended certain theses on grace which were vigorously attacked by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Domingo Ba&ucirc;ez. That this debate took place is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, but the text of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit's</a> these have never been published. As to those which were reported to the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, neither Montemayer nor any other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> ever acknowledged them as his. The controversy went on for six years, passing through three phases &#151; in <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> was the famous <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Michel Baius</a>, whose propositions were condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) Francisco de Toledo, authorized by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, had <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>, in 1580, to retract his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in presence of the entire <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> thereupon conceived a deep aversion for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and determined to have revenge. During the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> of 1597, he, with some of his colleagues, extracted from the notebooks of certain students who were disciples of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, thirty-four propositions, many of them plainly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, and asked the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to condemn "these <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> doctrines". Learning of this scheme, <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Leonard Lessius</a>, the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in the Low Countries and the special object of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius'</a> attacks, drew up another list of thirty-four propositions containing the genuine <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, presented them to the dean of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and asked for a hearing before some of the professors, in order to show how different his teaching was from that which was ascribed to him. The request was not granted. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> published, 9 September, 1587, a condemnation of the first thirty-four propositions. At once, throughout <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were called <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> urged the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Low Countries and the other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> to endorse the censure, and this in fact was done by some of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and in particular the <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">University of Douai</a>. In view of these measures, the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, <a href="../cathen/04419a.htm">Francis Coster</a>, issued a protest against the action of those who, without letting the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> be heard, accused them of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a> also published a statement to the effect that the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professors had misrepresented the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The professors replied with warmth. To clear up the issues <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a>, at the insistence of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, formulated six <em>antitheses</em>, or brief statements, embodying the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> relative to the matter of the condemned propositions, the third and fourth antithesis bearing upon the main problem, i.e., efficacious grace. The discussion was kept up on both sides for a year longer, until the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> succeeded in softening its asperities. He reminded the contestants that definitive judgment in such matters belonged to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy see</a> and he forwarded to <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> the principal publications of both parties with a petition for a final decision. This however, was not rendered; a controversy on the same lines had been started at Salamanca, and attention now centered on <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where the two discussions were merged into one.

<p>In 1588 the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Luis de Molina published at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> his "Concordia liberi arbitrii cum grati&aelig; donis", in which he explained efficacious grace on the basis of <em>scientia media</em>. Ba&ucirc;ez, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> professor at Salamanca, informed the Archduke Albert, Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, that the work contained certainly thirteen provisions which the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> had censured. The archduke forbade the sale of the book and sent a copy to Salamanca. Ba&ucirc;ez examined it and reported to the archduke that out of the thirteen propositions nine were held by Molina and that in consequence the book ought not to be circulated. He also noted the passages which, as he thought, contained the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Albert referred his comments to Molina who drew up the rejoinder. As the book had been approved by the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and its sale permitted by the Councils of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and of Castille and <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> it was thought proper to print at the end the replies of Molina; with these the work appeared in 1589. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> attacked it on the grounds that Molina and all the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> denied efficacious grace. The latter replied that such a denial was impossible on the part of any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. What they, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, attacked, was the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> theory of predetermination, which they regarded as incompatible with human freedom. The debates continued for five years and, in 1594, became public and turbulent at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, where Antonio de Padilla, S.J., and Diego Nu&ucirc;o, O.P., defended their respective positions. Similar encounters took place at Salamanca, <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, and other Spanish cities. In view of the disturbances thus created, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> took the matter into his own hands and ordered both parties to refrain from further discussion and await the decision of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then asked an expression of opinion from various <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and distinguished <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Between 1594 and 1597 twelve reports were submitted; by the three <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Salamanca, Alcal&ccedil;, and Sig&uuml;enza; by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363a.htm">Coria</a>, Sigovia, <a href="../cathen/12157a.htm">Plasencia</a>, Cartagena and Mondo&ntilde;edo, by Serra, Miguel Salon (Augustinian Friar), Castro (Canon of Toledo), and Luis Coloma, Prior of the Augustinians at Valladolid. There were also forwarded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> some statements in explanation and defense of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> theory. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> appointed a commission under the presidency of Cardinals Madrucci and Aragone, which began its labours 2 Jan., 1598, and on 19 March handed in the result condemning Molina's book. Displeased at their haste in treating a question of such importance, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered them to go over the work again, keeping in view the documents sent from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Though the examination of these would have required several years, the commission reported again in November and insisted on the condemnation of Molina. Thereupon <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> ordered the generals of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, respectively, to appear with some of their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> before the commission, explain their doctrines, and settle their differences. In obedience to this command both general began (22 February, 1599) before the commission a series of conferences which lasted through that year. <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in March, was admitted to the sessions. Little, however, was accomplished, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> aiming at criticism of Molina rather than exposition of their own views. The death of Cardinal Madrucci interrupted these conferences, and <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, seeing that no solution was to be reached on these lines, determined to have the matter discussed in his presence. At the first debate, 19 March, 1602, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> presided, with Cardinal Borghese (later <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>) and Arragone assisting, as well as the members of the former commission and various <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> summoned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Sixty-eight sessions were thus held (1602-1605).

<p><a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> died 5 March, 1605, and after the brief reign of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. In his presence seventeen debates took place. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were represented by Diego Alvarez and Tom&ccedil;s de Lemos; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> by Gregoria de Valencia, Pedro de Arrubal, Fernando de Bastida and Juan de Salas. Finally, after twenty years of discussion public and private, and eighty-five conferences in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, the question was not solved but an end was put to the disputes. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> communicated (5 September, 1607) to both <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, allowed each party to defend its own <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, enjoined each from censoring or condemning the opposite opinion, and commanded them to await, as loyal sons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the final decision of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. That decision, however, has not been reached, and both orders, consequently, maintain their respective theories, just as any other <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinion is held. The long controversy has aroused considerable feeling, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, aiming at the restoration of peace and charity between the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, forbade by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> (1 December, 1611) the publication of any book concerning efficacious grace until further action by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The prohibition remained in force during the greater part of the seventeenth century.
