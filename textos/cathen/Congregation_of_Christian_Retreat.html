<h1>Congregation of Christian Retreat</h1>  

<p>There are two branches of this congregation, the Fathers of Christian Retreat and the Sisters. It was founded on the 19th of November, 1789, at <a href="../cathen/06129a.htm">Fontenelle</a>, Doubs, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, by Father Antoine-Silvestre Receveur, who was declared Venerable in 1883 by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>. He had an extraordinary <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Cross, and was fond of saying "it was a cross to be without one". The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> raging at the time of its birth caused the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> to endure many privations and forced its members to make many <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. For three years the sisters, who at that time numbered seventy, were subjected to great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and then a revolutionary mob drove them out of their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. The choice was given them of death or separation from Father Receveur, which would have involved abandoning the life they had adopted. The sisters unanimously chose death rather than give up their vocation, and their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>, touched by their <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>, allowed them to go into exile. After ten years the storm of <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> subsided, they returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and in 1800 the congregation received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. Its work is the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth and the giving of spiritual retreats. The Fathers of Christian retreat used to direct colleges in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and still act as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> to the different <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the congregation. The Sisters of Christian Retreat teach in elementary and secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and their rule allows them time and opportunity for higher studies. Those sisters who from age or ill-health are unable to teach spend the greater part of the day in silence and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the members who are engaged in active work. They also do <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">needlework</a> and <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> of every description. Seven times a day the rule calls all the members to the foot of the altar, and every night at midnight a bell is rung in all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> to rouse the sisters to thank <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the grace of their vocations. On the 19th of November a special midnight services is held in memory of the entry at midnight into the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. A special service called the Adoration of the Cross is held every day in all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. There are no lay sisters; the work of the house is done by all the sisters according to the direction of the superior.

<p>In 1902 the congregation had seventeen houses, thirteen in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, four in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and more than a thousand members. There we then three novitiates, two in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and one in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but all the French houses except one have since been confiscated under the Association law. Convents were then opened in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> there are now seven <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, including a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> lasts two years; <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> without dowry, if qualified for teaching in secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, can be received. The habit is of white serge, with a white cape and <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>; no veil or wimple is worn, but instead a white linen band across the forehead and a white serge cap. The government is under a mother-general. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> are at Shepherd's Bush, near London; at Clapham; at Redhill, Surrey; at Cannock, Staffordshire, and three new foundations.
