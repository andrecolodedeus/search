<h1>Congregation of Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo</h1>  

<p>Founded by John Baptist Scalabrini, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (d. 1 June, 1905); approved in principle by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 25 November, 1887; constitution definitively approved by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a>, 3 October, 1908. The expediency of providing for the spiritual &mdash; and also, in some degree, for the temporal &mdash; needs of Italian emigrants to America was forcibly brought home to Bishop Scalabrini by the pathetic spectacle of a number of such emigrants waiting in the great railway station of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Acting upon this inspiration, and encouraged by Cardinal Simeoni, then Cardinal Prefect of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> acquired at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> a residence which he converted into "The Christopher Columbus Apostolic Institution", forming there a community of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> which was to be the nucleus of a new congregation.

<p>This congregation, which was henceforth to be known as the "Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo", was to be governed by a superior-general, dependent upon the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>; its aim was to maintain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and practice among Italian emigrants in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, and "to ensure as far as possible their moral, civil, and economical welfare"; it was to provide <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the emigrants, as well as committees of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who should give the good advice and practical direction needed by poor <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> newly arrived in foreign ports; to establish churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and missionary homes in the various Italian colonies in North and South America, and to train youths for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The members of the congregation promise obedience to their superiors in the congregation and the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>.

<p>Seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and three <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> of Bishop Scalabrini's institute left <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, on 12 July, 1888, of whom two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and one <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> were bound for New York, five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and two <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> for various parts of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. On this occasion, Cesare Cant&uacute;, the famous Italian historian, addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> some memorable words of congratulation, asking leave to add to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> blessing on the departing missionaries, "the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of an old man who admires a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and an abnegation so full of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>". A welcome had already been assured these first missionaries of the congregation by a commendatory letter (1 June, 1888) of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> addressed to the American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>Immediately after their arrival in New York the new missionaries were enabled to secure a favorable site in Centre Street, where there was a colony of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, and in a short time a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was opened; soon after this the church of the Resurrection was opened in Mulberry Street; lastly, a building in Roosevelt Street, which had been a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> place of worship, became the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the mission fathers who transformed it into the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Joachim, the first specially Italian church in the Diocese of New York. The Society of St. Raphael (see Emigrant Aid Societies) was organized at Ellis Island. The good work thereafter spread rapidly through the continent. The <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> now (1910) contain 21 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, besides several <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, served by the congregation; in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> the fathers have charge of 13 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, mostly with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> attached, and 2 important <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>. The two provinces (Eastern and Western) of the congregation in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> number 45 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 3 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, while the single province of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> numbers 35 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 5 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>.
