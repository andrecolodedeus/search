<h1>Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament</h1>  

<p>An enclosed congregation and a reform of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> devoted to the perpetual adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. It was founded in the face of great opposition by Father Anthony Le Quieu, a French <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> was stopped by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. Born in 1601 at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Friars Preachers</a> in the Rue St. Honor&eacute;, in 1622, and was in due time made master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> first in his own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and afterwards at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> (1634). While at the latter place (1639), he began to lay the foundation of the institute he desired to establish, but it was not till twenty years later (1659) that, after great difficulty, the first house was opened at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> for the three ladies whom the saintly founder had begun to train at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> gave them the habit the following year, approved the rule and constitutions Father Le Quieu had drawn up, and erected them into a simple congregation. It was not till after the death of the founder, who lived to see another foundation made at Bollene, that the constitutions were approved by <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Pope Innocent XII</a> (1693), who authorized the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> to take solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and bound them to enclosure. This was the first congregation instituted for the perpetual adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>; it is not an austere one, but the degree of perfection put before the members by the founder is very high. The original mother-house at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> was suppressed at the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were dispersed, but it was reopened in 1816; the Bollene houses suffered more severely. Thirteen of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> endured <a href="../cathen/04168a.htm">martyrdom under the Commune</a>. their cause of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> is now before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; the remainder of the Bollene community returned to their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and resumed their work of perpetual adoration in 1802. The Bollene <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> sent three of their number with one lay sister, under the Reverend Mother Emilie Pellier to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to found a house at Cannington (1863), a community which was afterwards moved to Taunton in Somersetshire, where it has since remained. There is also a house at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, and another near Newport. After Father Le Quieu's death foundations were made in the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and after the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> other houses were founded in the same locality. Since then a house has been established in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, from which another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> has been opened at Hal in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. There are no houses of this congregation in America.
