<h1>Congregation of the Immaculate Conception</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Congregation of the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady</h2>

<p>(The Conceptionists).

<p>Founded in 1484 at Toledo, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, by [Saint] <a href="../cathen/02375a.htm">Beatrix</a> de Silva, sister of Blessed Amadeus. On the marriage of Princess <a href="../cathen/05391a.htm">Elizabeth of Portugal</a> with John II, King of Castile, <a href="../cathen/02375a.htm">Beatrix</a> had accompanied the queen to the court of her husband, but her great beauty having aroused the jealousy of the queen, she escaped with difficulty and took refuge in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Toledo. Here for forty years she led a life of great <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, without, however, becoming a member of the order. Inspired by her <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a> to found a new congregation in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, <a href="../cathen/02375a.htm">Beatrix</a>, with some companions, took possession of a castle set apart for them by Queen Isabella. In 1489, by permission of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, the sisters adopted the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> rule, bound themselves to the daily recitation of the Office of the Immaculate Conception, and were placed under obedience to the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the archdiocese. In 1501 <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> united this congregation with the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> community of San Pedro de las Duenas, under the Rule of <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare</a>, but in 1511 <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> gave it a rule of its own, and in 1616 special constitutions were drawn up for the congregation by Cardinal Quignonez. The second <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was founded in 1507 at Torrigo, from which, in turn, were established seven others. The congregation soon spread through <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The foundress determined on the habit, which was white, with a white <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> and blue mantle.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> The foundress, Beatrice (sometimes "Brite") da Silva Meneses (1424-90), was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Paul VI in 1976; her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is 1 September.]
<h2 id="section2">Mission priests of the Immaculate Conception</h2>

<p>(Usually called Missionaries of Rennes).

<p>Founded at St-M&eacute;en in the <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Diocese of Rennes</a>, by <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">Jean-Marie-Robert de Lamennais</a>, for the care of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and the holding of missions. The disciples of the founder's younger brother, F&eacute;licit&eacute;, in 1829 withdrew with him into the solitude of La Ch&ecirc;naie, forming the famous Society of St. Peter, with which the elder community at its own request was united, under the superiorship of F&eacute;licit&eacute;. The new congregation was placed under simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, the aims proposed being the defence of the Faith, the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth, and the giving of missions. A house of studies was erected at Malestroit, near Plo&eacute;rmel, and placed under the direction of Fathers Blanc and Rohrbacher, while <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">Lamennais</a> remained at La Ch&ecirc;naie, with the younger members, writing for them his "Guide de la jeunesse", and for others more advanced the "Journ&eacute;e du chr&eacute;tien". <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">Lamennais's</a> long-cherished project of forming a body of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> thoroughly equipped for pressing needs in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, a scheme which he outlined in 1825 in a letter to M. de Salinis, seemed well on the way towards fulfilment. A vivid picture of the rule of life and the spirit of La Ch&ecirc;naie is to be found in the letters of Maurice de Gu&eacute;rin, whose companions were such men as <a href="../cathen/06470b.htm">Gerbet</a>, <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Gu&eacute;ranger</a>, <a href="../cathen/06398b.htm">Gaume</a>, Scorbiac, and Ch. de Sainte-Foi. The condemnation of "L'Avenir" disturbed only temporarily the activity of La Ch&eacute;naie. On the final defection of F&eacute;licit&eacute;, however, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a> transferred to Jean-Marie the superiorship of the congregation, the members of which left La Ch&ecirc;naie for Malestroit, <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> being now excluded. The congregation, reorganized, gained a new lease of life in 1837 and by 1861 had 200 members in 9 houses, under the mother-house at <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Servites of the Immaculate Conception</h2>

<p>Founded in 1864 by Peter Carisciarian, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Georgian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, at Constantinople, to minister to the spiritual wants of Georgian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The congregation was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 29 May, 1875. Approval was given for the three rites, Latin, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and Georgian, the first two for use among the Georgians in their native country, the last to keep up the Greek-Georgian Rite in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Constantinople, which is the mother-house of the congregation. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Immaculate Conception have charge of three congregations at Constantinople, one at Feri-kuei, for Georgians and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, another for the Latins at <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a>, and a third for Georgians at Pera. Candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saratow, who is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior of <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>; for a time they fill <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, after which they are appointed by the congregation to some post where they may minister to their countrymen.

<p>The Sister Servites of the Immaculate Conception conduct two primary schools, to which children are admitted, without distinction of creed.
<h2 id="section4">Sisters of Providence of the Immaculate Conception</h2>

<p>Founded at Jodoigne, in 1833, definitively established at Champion near Namur in 1836, by Canon Jean-Baptiste-Victor Kinet, for the instruction of children, the care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, and the service of the sick and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. In 1858 the congregation received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and shortly afterwards the confirmation of its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. By 1876 there were a hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The mother-house is at Champion.
<h2 id="section5">Sisters of the Immaculate Conception</h2>

<p>A branch of the Institute of the Holy Family, founded in 1820 by the Abb&eacute; Pierre Bonaventure Noailles, Canon of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. Abb&eacute; Noailles when studying at the Seminary of St. Sulpice, Paris, conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of founding a congregation, in which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of every class of life might lead a life of perfection. In 1820 he placed the first three members of the Holy Family in a house at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, under the name of the Ladies of Loreto. As the numbers increased the sisters were divided by their founder into two categories: (1) Those engaged directly in the various works undertaken by the Institute; (2) Lay sisters who perform household <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and are called the Sisters of St. Martha. The first are sub-divided into three branches: (a) The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> who undertake the charge of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>; (b) The Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, who devote themselves to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work; (c) The Sisters of Hope, who nurse the sick. The Institute encountered much opposition at first, but the constitutions have now been canonically approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The works of the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception are very numerous; they devote themselves to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work and visiting the poor. They have fifteen <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, to all of which and to five boarding-schools elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are attached. About 230 sisters teach in these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. The English Novitiate is at Rock Ferry, Cheshire. The other English houses are at Great Prescot Street, London, E.; Leeds; Sicklinghall, Yorkshire; Stockport; Macclesfield; Stalybridge; Woodford, Essex; Ramsgate; Liscard, Cheshire; Birkenhead; Wrexham, <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>; Leith, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. Attached to the Leeds <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> is a juniorate for testing vocations. The habit in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> only is blue with a white girdle and a black veil. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> they have one house in the <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Archdiocese of Armagh</a> at Magherafelt, and another in Kildare, to both of which <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are attached. The institute has <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> houses at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux, France</a>; Bas-Oha, <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>; Hortaleza, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; Bellair, Natal, South Africa; <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; and two in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. Besides the novitiates there are juniorates attached to some of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. There is one at Loz&egrave;re, <a href="../cathen/10180a.htm">Mende</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and one at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and one at Fromista, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.
