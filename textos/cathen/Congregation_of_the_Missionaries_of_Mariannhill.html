<h1>Congregation of the Missionaries of Mariannhill</h1>  

<p>Mariannhill is located in Natal, near Pinetown, 15 miles from Durban, and 56 from Pietermaritzburg. In 1882 the <a href="../cathen/11785c.htm">Rev. Francis Pfanner</a>, then <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> (Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>) Monastery of Mariastern (Bosnia), at the invitation of the late Bishop Ricards, and with the consent of the general chapter of that branch of the order called the Congregation of De Ranc&eacute;, volunteered to establish a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Cape Colony, in order to try to adapt their rule to the missionary life. He landed at Port Elizabeth with thirty-one companions in July, 1880, and settled in a place he called Dunbrody, after an old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. This he had to abandon in 1882; and at the solicitation of the late Bishop Jolivet, O.M.I., transferred his community to Mariannhill. Upon arrival there he set to work with indefatigable energy in the missionary field, and was blessed with such success that in 1885 Mariannhill was erected into an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11785c.htm">Father Pfanner</a> was unanimously elected its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, receiving the abbatial blessing on the third anniversary of the founding of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, 27 Dec., 1885. The same year <a href="../cathen/11785c.htm">Abbot Pfanner</a> had started a branch of missionary sisters called "Sisters of the Precious Blood" to take charge of the native children and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; this congregation flourished abundantly, and was approved by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1907.

<p>Mariannhill was too restricted for the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/11785c.htm">Abbot Pfanner</a>, so in the course of a few years, he founded seven mission stations, scattered over Natal, from Transvaal (Ratschitz) to Cape Colony (Lourdes) in Griqualand. Each of these stations had a small community of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and another of sisters, with church, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, etc., according to the needs of the natives. In 1892 <a href="../cathen/11785c.htm">Abbot Pfanner</a>, who was then sixty-seven years of age, resigned and retired to <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>, one of the stations, where he died on 24 May, 1909. He was immediately succeeded by Dom Amandus Schoelzig as administrator, and in 1894 as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Under his wise administration nine stations were founded in Natal and Cape Colony, and two houses in German East Africa. Abbot Amandus died in January, 1900, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to the great work and its many cares. In Sept. of the same year he was succeeded by Abbot Gerard Wolpert, who had spent the greater part of his missionary life at the Czenstochau Station. He founded a station in Mashonaland, <a href="../cathen/13025a.htm">Rhodesia</a>, and two more in Natal so that his activity was divided between German East Africa, <a href="../cathen/13025a.htm">Rhodesia</a>, Natal and Cape Colony. This, however, was too much for his strength; his health gave way, and being anxious to return to his mission life at Czenstochau, he resigned his position in 1904.

<p>During the general chapter of the order held that year at <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, the Rt. Rev. Edmond M. Obrecht, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the Abbey of Gethsemani, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> was appointed, with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, Administrator of Mariannhill. His principal labour was to enquire into the adaptability of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> to the missionary life; after three years of work in Africa the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Gethsemani submitted his report to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the general chapter, from which it was decided that Mariannhill should become an independent congregation, as otherwise either the monastic observances or the missionary labour had to suffer. Consequently <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> delegated Rt. Rev. Bishop Miller, O.M.I., Vicar-Apostolic of Transvaal, to arrange for such independence, according to the wishes of the Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, and the members of Mariannhill. Finally the Congregation of Regulars, on 2 Feb., 1909, issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> separating Mariannhill from the Order of Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, forming of it the "Congregation of the Mariannhill Missionaries" and erecting their church into a Collegiate Church, under the guidance of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>. The members of the congregation take simple, but perpetual, <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; and are exempt from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Ordinary of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. They at present number about 60 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, with 260 choir-religious and lay-brothers. From its foundation until 1 Jan. 1910, nearly 20,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the greater number adults, have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the 55 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> scattered throughout the 26 missions and stations.
