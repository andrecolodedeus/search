<h1>Congregation of the Most Precious Blood</h1>  

<p>An association of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> living in community, whose principal aim is to give missions and retreats. The members take no <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> but are held together by the bond of charity only and by a promise "not to leave the community without permission of the lawful superior". The congregation was founded at the desire of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> after his return from exile by <a href="../cathen/06390b.htm">[Saint] Gaspare del Bufalo</a>. Distressed at the spiritual condition of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> determined that missions should be held throughout the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> and selected <a href="../cathen/06390b.htm">del Bufalo</a> and a few other <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to undertake the task (1814), assigning to them the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of San Felice at Giano, where a foundation was made 15 Aug., 1815. New houses were opened, and in 1820 six missions were established in the Compagna for the conversion of the banditti. The growth of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was checked at the election of <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> (1823), who, misinformed as to the work of the congregation and its founder, was unfavourable. He objected to the proposed name, "Congregation of the Most Precious Blood", as a novelty; but the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was finally cleared of all accusations and P. Betti justified the name from Scripture and the Fathers. [Saint] Gaspare was succeeded by Don Biagio Valentini, a member of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> since 1817. His successor, the Ven. Giovanni Merlini (the process of whose <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> has been begun in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), was a native of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and a friend of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, whose exile at <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a> he shared. Through the influence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, several new houses were opened in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and one each in Alsace and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The mother-house was established in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Crociferi, Maria in Trivio. Merlini died 13 January, 1873, and was succeeded by Don Enrico Rizzoli. Under his rule the Italian Government (1860, 1866, 1870) confiscated, among others, Maria in Trivio, since when the fathers who are in charge of this church have to rent a few rooms in their own house. In the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> garden a <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodist</a> church was erected, but owing to the scanty attendance it was soon closed and is now used as a theatre. The Government confiscated the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a> and suppressed altogether twenty-five houses. The <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a> closed the houses in Alsace and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Rizzoli was succeeded by Mgr Caporali, in 1890 <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a>; Mgr Salvatore Palmieri, to whom the Government refused the <a href="../cathen/05707a.htm">exequatur</a> when he was named <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a>, but later acquiesced in his <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconization</a> as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02787e.htm">Brindisi</a> (1893); Aloysius Biaschelli; the present general is Very Rev. Hyacinthe Petroni.

<p>The congregation was introduced into America (1844) at the request of <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, by <a href="../cathen/03012a.htm">Rev. Francis de S. Brunner</a>. It conducts a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> (Collegeville, Ind.) and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> (Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, Toledo), <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> (<a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Diocese of Fort Wayne</a>), Missouri (<a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">Diocese of St. Joseph</a> and Kansas City), Illinois (<a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Archdiocese of Chicago</a>), Nebraska (<a href="../cathen/09266a.htm">Diocese of Lincoln</a>). The chief work of the order is the giving of missions and assisting the secular <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> on occasions such as tridua, Forty Hours devotions, retreats, etc. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> is at Burkettsville, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>.

<p>In America candidates pass through a year of probation, after which they are admitted either as brothers, and then take the promise of fidelity, or as students, to follow a six years' course in classical studies. Such of the students as receive the degree A.B. enter the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and after the first year of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> give the promise of fidelity. After five years more of study, they are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, and a year later become eligible to full membership. If the ballot is favourable, they are admitted and invested with the missionary's insignia (a large ebony crucifix with brass figure and brass chain, worn over the heart). In <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the method of adopting members is somewhat different, since there none are admitted before they are at least students of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; often <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> join the congregation.

<p>The present statistics for the congregation are: <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 3 provinces, 15 houses, the principal ones being at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Santa Maria in Trivio), <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>, and San Paolo; <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1 province, 2 houses; North America, 1 province with a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Carthagena, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, seat of the provincial; a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Collegeville, Ind., with 300 students; <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Burkettsville, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and missions: <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, 19; <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, 4; Missouri, 6; Nebraska, 2. The house at Shellenberg (Liechtenstein) belongs to the American province. There are in the American province 110 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 20 seminarians, 75 collegians, 70 lay-brothers, 35 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 17 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and 44 missions and stations.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> Gaspare, or <a href="../cathen/06390b.htm">Caspar del Bufalo</a> (1786-1837) was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1954 by Pope Pius XII. He died at <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a> on 28 December, a victim of cholera, and is commemorated on 2 January.]
<h2>Knights of the Precious Blood</h2>

<p>At Mantua in 1608 a knight-order of the Precious Blood, which received the approval of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, was founded by Vincente del Gonzaga, Duke of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>. Its aim was to protect the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relic</a> of the Precious Blood. The members wore on a golden ribbon a remonstrance, representing two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> holding up a vase containing three drops of blood. The Dukes of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> were grandmasters, until Emperor Joseph I declared the dukedom abolished; the order was then dissolved. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relic</a> is said to have disappeared since 1848. [See also: <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">THE MILITARY ORDERS</a> and <a href="../cathen/12677c.htm">KNIGHTS OF THE REDEEMER</a>.]
