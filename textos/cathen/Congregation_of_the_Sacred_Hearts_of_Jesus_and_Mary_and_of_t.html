<h1>Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and of the Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar</h1>  

<p>Better known as the Congregation of Picpus, was founded by Father Coudrin, b. at Coursay-les-Bois, in Poitou on 1 March, 1768. He was only <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> when the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, directed against the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, dispersed the students of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, where he was being trained. Having learned that Mgr de Bonald, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, was in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and would confer <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a> upon him, he set out for that city, and on 4 March, 1792, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the Irish Seminary. The <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> took place in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolutionaries</a> had invaded the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in which they were actually holding their meetings. After <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he returned to Coursay, but the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> soon compelled him to hide elsewhere. During October of the same year, disguised, he labored in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> and <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>.

<p>Father Coudrin gathered around him a few companions, to whom he communicated his views to promote devotion to the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and of Mary, and who were also willing to assist him in his great work. On <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> night, 1800, he solemnly made his religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, devoting himself entirely to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Sacred Hearts. During the year 1805 Father Coudrin bought some dilapidated houses in the Rue Picpus in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and there established himself with a few of his religious. A college for the training of youths and a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> were soon started. "The Good Father", as his <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> used to call him, governed his congregation with tact and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and in spite of many difficulties, his work prospered. Several new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and colleges were founded and opened in various towns.

<p>In 1825 the evangelization of the <a href="../cathen/13438a.htm">Sandwich Islands</a> in the Pacific Ocean was entrusted by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts, and the following year the first band of missionaries of the Sacred Hearts left <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to carry the Faith to the inhabitants. In 1833 the Archipelagos of Oriental Oceanica were likewise confided to the same Congregation and immediately missionaries were sent to the Gambier Islands; some of these fathers established houses of the congregation in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> and <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, South America. Not long afterwards other evangelical laborers were sent to the Marquesa Islands at the death of the founder in 1837. The perpetual adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was made day and night in nineteen houses, while several other houses had also been founded abroad.

<p>In 1817 it was formally approved by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, in 1825 by <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>, and in 1840 by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, under the name of Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and of the Perpetual Adoration of the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar. Its special aim is to honor and imitate the four ages of our Lord: His infancy by the instruction of children, and by the formation of youths for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; His hidden life by the exercise of the Adoration; His public life, by preaching and by missionary work; His crucified life by the works of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">Christian mortification</a>. At the present day the missions confided to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts comprise three Apostolic Vicariates: the Tahiti Islands, Marquesa Islands, and the <a href="../cathen/13438a.htm">Hawaiian Islands</a>, where Father Damien fell a victim to his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and generous devotion for the poor <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> of Molokai. The Congregation of the Sacred Hearts, which depends directly upon the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, is governed by a Superior General, who is elected for life. The members make perpetual but simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> after a probation of eighteen months' <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. In 1898 the Congregation was divided into three provinces. The <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> province, under which <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a> are comprised, has a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and a house of studies at Courtray. The provincial has his residence in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Sacred Hearts in <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, Mount St. Antoine, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. The superior in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is in the Damien house of Eccleshall in Staffordshire; in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Sacred Hearts at Fairhaven in <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>.
