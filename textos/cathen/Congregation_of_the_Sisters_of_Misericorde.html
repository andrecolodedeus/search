<h1>Congregation of the Sisters of Misericorde</h1>  

<p>A congregation of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> founded 16 January, 1848, for the purpose of procuring spiritual and corporal assistance for poor mothers and unfortunate girls. The foundress, Madame Rosalie Jette, in religion Mother Mary of the Nativity, declining to serve as superior, Sister St. Jane de Chantal held that office. The institution was approved by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 7 June, 1867; and the constitutions, revised according to the latest rules of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 21 March, 1905. The order is governed by a superior general, assisted by four councillors, a secretary, and a bursar, who reside at the mother-house, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. All branch houses are under the control of the general administration. Each house is governed by a local superior and two assistants forming her council; in each a bursar has charge of temporal matters, but is controlled by the council. There is only one <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, although the rules authorize more if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Candidates are received from all parts of the world. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> lasts a year, during which the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> is instructed in the constitutions of the order and other matters of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>; a supplementary novice-ship of six months, in which to become familiar with the work of the order, is given before taking the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, renewed annually during, a period of five years and then made perpetual. The sisters also conduct <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">Magdalen</a> asylums. In receiving patients no discrimination is made in regard to religion, colour, or nationality. After their convalescence, those who desire to remain in the home are placed under a special sister and are known as "Daughters of St. Margaret". They follow a certain rule of life but contract no religious <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. Should they desire to remain in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, after a period of probation, they are allowed to become <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">Magdalens</a> and eventually make the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">Magdalen order</a>. The congregation celebrated its fiftieth anniversary 16 January, 1898.

<p>At present the congregation numbers professed sisters, 189; <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 23; candidates, 10. Branch houses have been established throughout <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The mother-house contains 60 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; with this is associated on <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphan Asylum</a> with sisters, 7; infants, 525; also a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> with 5 sisters and accommodations for 175 patients. At Sault-au-Recollet, P. Q., the sisters conduct a home for aged and retired <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphan Asylum</a> with sisters, 10; attendants, 15; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 5, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, 40. The <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Ottawa. founded in 1879, was destroyed by fire in 1900. The new building, completed in 1904, accommodates sisters, 10; nurses, 5; patients, 100. A house was established at Winnipeg, Man., in 1898, of which a branch was founded at St. Norbert, Man., in 1904. The two houses have sisters,19; trained nurses, 15; attendants, 25; average number of patients and children during the year, 700. In 1900 a house was opened at Edmonton, <a href="../cathen/13482b.htm">Alberta</a>, with sisters, 12; trained nurses, 6; average number of patients during the year, 300. In the United States the sisters have a large <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in New York City, containing sisters, 19; average number of patients during the year, 496. From this, in 1901, was established the Orphan Asylum and Kindergarten of St. Mary's of the Angels, at Hartsdale with sisters,10; attendants, 20; average number of children during the year, 150. In Green Bay, Wis., a house was established in 1900 with sisters, 13; nurses,15; average number of patients and children during the year, 450. In Oak Park, Ill., a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was founded in 1905 with sisters, 15; patients, 712. The establishment at <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a> contains accommodations for sisters, 9; patients, 112.
