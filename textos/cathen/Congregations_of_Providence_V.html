<p>SISTERS OF THE INSTITUTE OF CHARITY</p>

<p>An offshoot from the Sisters of Providence, founded by <a href="../cathen/10609a.htm">Jean-Martin Moye</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1762 for teaching poor girls and tending the sick. Their present existence, constitution, and <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> are due to Antonio <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, of whose institute they really form a part. In 1831, at the request of Abb&eacute; L&ouml;wenbruck, the French sisters received into their house at Portieux four <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> but uneducated young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from the Val d'Ossola and neighbouring <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> valleys. This <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, one of the moving spirits in the Institute of Charity then beginning at Domodossola, wished these young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to receive a religious training at Portieux and then to found a house in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. They returned in 1832 and joined a community already organized at Locarno in Ticino, and designed to be a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> as well as a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the poor. He provided no funds, however, and though they opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, being but slenderly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> they could get no salaries as recognized teachers. This bad management induced <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a> to intervene. He reformed their rule to suit it to its new conditions, and thenceforward had to assume entire responsibility for them. Thus they were from the first a distinct body, the "Rosminiane", as the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> call them. A house for <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of teaching sisters was formed at Domodossola in a former <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in its solemn approval of the Institute of Charity in 1839 gave an indirect recognition of the sisters also, as adopted children of the institute, From that time they have steadily increased. The order is mainly contemplative; but, when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, they undertake any charitable work suitable to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, especially the teaching of girls and young children, visiting the sick, and instructing in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>. The central houses have smaller establishments emanating from and depending upon them. For each of these groups there is one superioress, elected by the professed sisters for three years, and eligible for three years more. Aided by assistants, she appoints a procuratrix over each lesser establishment and assigns the grades and most of the offices. All the sisters return to their central house every summer for a retreat and to hold a chapter for the election of officers. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> lasts three years; the usual three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are then taken, at first for three years, then either renewed or made perpetual. In each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is protector.

<p>There are houses in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> there were in 1908 about 600 sisters and 60 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. They have 64 establishments, most of which are elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for children and girls; there are also several boarding-schools for girls, a few <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and a home for poor old men. They are scattered in nine <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, some in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, others in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. The principal houses are those of Borgomanero, the central house for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Domodossola, Intra, and <a href="../cathen/02559b.htm">Biella</a>. The English branch began in 1843 on the initiative of Lady Mary Arundel, who had taken a house at Loughborough in order to aid the Fathers of the Institute in that mission. Into this house, fitted as a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, she received two Italian sisters, the first <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> to wear a religious habit in the English Midlands since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. A year later they opened a girls' and infants' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which was the first day-school for the poor taught by <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The first English superioress was Mary Agnes Amherst, niece of the Earl of <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>. Under her rule the present central house was built at Loughborough. A boarding-school and middle and elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are conducted by the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. There are six other establishments. At <a href="../cathen/05554b.htm">St. Etheldreda's</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and at Whitwick, Rugby, and Bexhill they have girls' and infants' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, at Cardiff, two houses, one for visiting the sick and aiding the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the other a secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and pupil-teachers' centre. Whitwick and St. David's, Cardiff, are the only places in which their work is not auxiliary to that of the Fathers of the Institute. (See <a href="../cathen/13198a.htm">ROSMINIANS</a>.)
