<h1>Congregations of the Heart of Mary</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Sisters of the Holy Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>Founded in 1842 at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, by Mgr Menjaud, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> and Toul, for the purpose of instructing young girls in various trades, and protecting their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, drawn up by the Abb&eacute; Masson, provide that the congregation shall own nothing but the houses which they occupy; that everything over and above shall go to the maintenance of poor children and the decoration of altars. The devotion of Perpetual Adoration was instituted in the mother-house.
<h2 id="section2">Sister-servants of the Holy Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>Founded at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1860, by P&egrave;re Delaplace, and Marie-Jeanne Moisan, for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children, and the visitation and care of the sick in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and in their own homes. This congregation is particularly flourishing in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where about 140 sisters have charge of about 2500 children. There are six communities in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>Founded by Mgr Kob&egrave;s, at Dakar, Senegambia, 24 May, 1858, for native <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. In touch as they are with the customs and dialects of their country, they render invaluable services in teaching, visiting various mission stations, caring for the sick, and preparing <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Their immunity from yellow fever enables them to care for the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> stricken during epidemics. In the <a href="../cathen/13715a.htm">Vicariate of Senegambia</a> are six communities with about forty sisters.
<h2 id="section4">Congregation of the Holy and Immaculate Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>Founded, at the desire of the Synod of <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>, by P&egrave;re Dupuis for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young Indian girls. The native prejudice against the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was gradually overcome and the congregation now counts over 200 religious, in charge of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, pharmacies, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Most of the sisters have government certificates of proficiency in the various grades.
<h2 id="section5">Sisters of the Holy and Immaculate Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>Founded in July, 1848, at Pico Heights, <a href="../cathen/10532a.htm">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, U.S.A. In the <a href="../cathen/10532a.htm">Diocese of Monterey and Los Angeles</a> the sisters number about 110, and have charge of about 700 children and 60 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, in 1 college, 5 academies, and 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>.
<h2 id="section6">Daughters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>The name taken by an association of ladies in charge of the home for incurables at <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, on their organization into a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community in 1841. The home had been in existence since 1700, had withstood the rigours of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, and had never been without a band of devoted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, bound only by the ties of charity, and tacitly rendering obedience to the oldest of their number.
<h2 id="section7">Sister-Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>Founded at Quebec in 1859 by Mgr Turgeon, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Quebec, and Mme Marie Roy, in religion Sister Marie du Sacr&eacute;-Coeur (d. 1885), to shelter penitent girls, and provide <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for children. The congregation now numbers about 400 members in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in charge of 26 establishments, 152 penitents, and about 5500 children.
<h2 id="section8">Sisters Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>Founded at Monroe, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> 28 November, 1845, by the Rev. Louis Gillet, C.SS.R., for the work of teaching. In 1856 an independent mother-house was established at Villa Maria, Westchester County, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, and later a third at <a href="../cathen/13633a.htm">Scranton</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. The members of this congregation are in charge of academies, normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and asylums in eleven <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and number about 1200 sisters.
<h2 id="section9">Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>(The Claretians).

<p>Founded at <a href="../cathen/15405a.htm">Vich</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1848, by [Saint] Antonio Mar&iacute;a Claret (d. 1870). They have charge of a mission on the Fernando Po, and are also stationed at Corisco and Annabon in Western Africa.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> The founder of the Claretians, Antonio Mar&iacute;a Claret y Clara (1807-70), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Santiago, <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, and Confessor to Queen Isabella II of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Pius XII in 1950; his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is 24 October.]
<h2 id="section10">Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>(Also called the Congregation of Scheutveld).

<p>Founded in 1863 by Ven. Th&eacute;ophile Verbiest (d. 1865), a former military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, for mission work in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> countries. Father Verbiest's desire to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> himself to the life of a missionary seemed on the point of fulfilment when the Treaty of Peking (1861) opened <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and that of the little band who desired to accompany him. On seeking <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> permission, however, they were commissioned by Cardinal Barbaro, Prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, to begin their work by founding a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> to supply <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for foreign missions, and laid the foundations of the Scheutveld College, 28 April, 1863, in the Field of Scheut, a short distance from <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. In September, 1863, missionaries set forth for <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>. The Scheutveld <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have faced severe perils, as, for instance, the Boxer rebellion in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, involving the massacre of Bishop Hamer, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of South-Western <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, seven missionaries, and 3000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; the even greater decimation of their numbers by the Congo climate, not to mention the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the missionaries and the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> colonies established by them. The congregation now numbers over 300 members in charge of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariates Apostolic</a> of Central, Eastern, and South-Western <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> the <a href="../cathen/08602c.htm">Vicariate of Northern Kan-su</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08602b.htm">Prefecture Apostolic of Southern Kan-su</a>, where in all about 155 Fathers have charge of about 51,600 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 20,000 <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, 250 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and 263 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with an attendance of 6000; in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, in the Vicariate Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/04228a.htm">Belgian Congo</a> and the Prefecture of Upper Kassai, 52 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 20 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> are over about 15,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 29,300 <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, 38 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and 28 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, attended by 2300 children. In connection with their missions the Fathers have opened a number of benevolent institutions, for example the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at St-Trudhon, Upper Kassai, for those afflicted with sleeping sickness. Their activity in ransoming and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> children is reaping a rich harvest. The organ of the congregation is "Missions en Chine et au Congo".
<h2 id="section11">Sisters of the Most Pure Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>Founded at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, in 1843, by Barbara Maix (d. 1873), and in 1848 established in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, where, in addition to the mother-house at <a href="../cathen/12289c.htm">Porto Alegre</a>, they have nine institutions, chiefly <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>.
<h2 id="section12">Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>Founded in 1848 by Jean Gailhac at B&eacute;ziers in the <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Diocese of Montpellier</a>, for the work of teaching and the care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. They were approved by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, and have institutions in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
