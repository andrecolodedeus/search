<h1>Congregations of the Holy Family</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Association of the Holy Family</h2>

<p>Founded in 1820 by the Abb&eacute; Pierre Bienvenue Noailles (d. 1861), to fill in some measure the immense gap left by the ravages wrought in <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. The institute began with three young ladies, who formed a community under the direction of the Abb&eacute; Noailles, under the name of Sisters of Loreto. It now consists of seven congregations, each with distinctive work, garb, and particular rules, but all under common constitutions, and directed by the Superior General of the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, aided by another <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the same congregation, as well as by a directress general and her assistants. The association has received <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> many times, beginning with 1831, even as recently as 1904. <ul> <li><em>The Sisters of the Holy Family</em> proper, or Solitary Sisters, lead a contemplative life, devoting themselves to perpetual adoration and intercession for the success of the active members of the institute. <li><em>The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a></em> are occupied with the care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, whom they instruct in various trades. <li><em>The Sisters of Loreto</em> conduct private day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls of the higher classes in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. <li><em>The Sisters of the Immaculate Conception</em> are in charge of day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and kindergartens; they devote particular attention to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, care for the sick, and look after the sodalities in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> to which they are attached. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> they are engaged in the national or government <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. <li><em>The Sisters of Hope</em> nurse the sick in their own homes, and conduct <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, infirmaries, and institutions of a like nature. <li><em>The Field Sisters</em> (Soeurs Agricoles) have agricultural <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, where their charges are trained in all agricultural pursuits. <li><em>The Sisters of St. Martha</em>, or lay sisters, attend to all the domestic work connected with the various institutions of the Holy Family. </ul> Owing to the pressure of new social conditions the number of congregations and their respective <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> have undergone a gradual change. The institute has extended its activities to Ceylon (1862), South Africa (1864), and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (1865), where the sisters have <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>. At present (1909) there are about 240 houses with 3400 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, in charge of 25,000 children and 16,000 poor and sick.
<h2 id="section2">Brothers of the Holy Family</h2>

<p>Founded in 1824 in the Diocese of Saint-Claude by Gabriel Taborin who gathered about him five young men, for the work of teaching and the service of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as chanters and <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> most successful, but on various pretexts his companions deserted him, and Brother Gabriel was forced to give up the work temporarily. After labouring for some time in other <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Diocese of Belley</a>, where in 1827 he made a second and successful attempt to found his congregation at Hauteville, establishing a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, first at Belmont, in 1829, and that house proving inadequate, at <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Belley</a> in 1840. In 1841 the institute and its constitutions received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, and in the following year government authorization and exemption from military service in the <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinian</a> States. The members are teachers and <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, under the direction of a superior general elected for life, assisted by a vice-superior, the council of the mother-house, and the general chapter. The only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> admitted as members are those needed to fulfil the sacred offices.
<h2 id="section3">Little Sisters of the Holy Family</h2>

<p>Founded at Memramcook, New Brunswick, 15 October, 1874, for the temporal care of colleges, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and episcopal residences. In 1895 the mother-house was removed to <a href="../cathen/13756d.htm">Sherbrooke</a>, Quebec. The sisters, who are engaged in many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Diocese of Portland</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> number about 500, in charge of 35 missions. Their pupils are employed as cooks, seamstresses, infirmarians, laundresses, etc.
<h2 id="section4">Sisters of the Holy Family</h2>

<p>Formerly known as DAUGHTERS OF THE HOLY FAMILY, and later as MIRAMIONES. In 1636 Fran&ccedil;oise de Blosset (d. 1642), a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> collaborator of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, founded in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community known as Daughters of <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a>, for the care of the poor and infirm, the gratuitous instruction of young girls, and the training of teachers for country <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were approved in 1658 by Cardinal de Gondi, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and recognized by royal letters patent. Mme de Miramion (b. 1629; d. 1696), having devoted the sixteen years of her <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a> and her immense fortune to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, in 1661, gathered about her a number of young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to lead a community life, under the patronage of the Holy Family, their aims coinciding almost exactly with those of the Daughters of <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a>. In 1665 a union of the two congregations was effected with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the new institute approved in 1668 by Cardinal Vend&ocirc;me, legatus a latere to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Mme de Miramion was elected superior, and in 1674 purchased a mother-house, defraying all expenses herself until the community became self-supporting. New constitutions were drawn up and submitted, for both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and government authorization. In time, several other communities also requested and obtained union with the Daughters of the Holy Family, known after Mme de Miramion's death as Miramiones. Under the direction of their superior, the sisters distinguished themselves by their devotion to the sick, especially in time of epidemic. It was she also who, emulating the example of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, established a house of retreat for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Lay sisters performed all domestic labour, and provision was made for those who, not being able to follow the community exercises, wished to live under the same roof and co-operate with the sisters in their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. After a year of probation, these were received as associates, having no voice in the government of the community. In 1806 the Miramiones, who had not survived the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, were re-established at <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, Jeanne-Claude Jacoulet, and were soon in charge of day-schools, boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, asylums, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of domestic economy.
<h2 id="section5">Sisters of the Holy Family</h2>

<p>Founded at <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, in 1872, by Elizabeth Armer, under the direction of Very Rev. J. J.  Prendergast, for the instruction of neglected children for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the organization of sodalities and sewing classes, and chiefly the daily care of the young children of working-women. In San Francisco are 90 sisters with 4 day homes, attended by 700 children. They have also a house at San Jos&eacute;.
<h2 id="section6">Sisters of the Holy Family</h2>

<p>A congregation of coloured sisters founded for work among their own race, 21 November, 1842, at <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, by Josephine Charles and Harriet Delisle, of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, Juliette Gaudin of Cuba, and Mlle Alcot, a young French lady, under the direction of Father Etienne Rousselon, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>. They began by teaching the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> and preparing children and adults for first Communion and confirmation, a work which was gradually extended in scope, so that at the present time (1909) the 105 sisters of the congregation have charge of an academy and many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, attended by about 1300 pupils, an asylum for coloured girls, a home for the aged, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for coloured boys and girls, and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> and the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>, <a href="../cathen/09295a.htm">Little Rock</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07449b.htm">Honduras</a>. They follow the rule of St. Augustine.
<h2 id="section7">Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth</h2>

<p>Founded by Frances Siedliska, a noble Polish lady, in 1874, under the auspices of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. In 1885 they began work in the <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Archdiocese of Chicago</a>, and were soon in demand for many Polish <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> throughout the country. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> alone there are 450 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, in charge of 1 academy, 31 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with an attendance of 12,000 pupils, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, and a home for working- girls. The mother-house is in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
