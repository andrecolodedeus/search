<h1>Congregations of the Precious Blood</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Bernadines of the Precious Blood</h2>

<p>A congregation of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, no longer in existence, founded by Mother Ballou with the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, as an offshoot of the reformed <a href="../cathen/03790a.htm">Cistercianesses</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Daughters of the Precious Blood</h2>

<p>The Daughters of the Precious Blood were founded by Maria Seraphina Spiehermans at Sittard, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, 1862, and approved by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 12 July, 1890. Their main object is the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls, and the care of the sick. They wear a red girdle, and on a red ribbon a cross with the initials F. P. S. (Filia Pretiosi Sanguinis&mdash;daughter of the Precious Blood). <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> appointed Cardinal Mazzella as their cardinal protector. The mother-house is in Koningbosch, <a href="../cathen/13110a.htm">Diocese of Roermond</a>. They assist especially the Missionary <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a> in German East Africa. As yet they have made no foundation in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
<h2>Sister Adorers of the Precious Blood</h2>

<p>A congregation of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> established 14 September, 1861, by Right Rev. Joseph La Rocque, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Hyacinthe (Prov. Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>), with the co-operation of Mgr. J. S. Raymond, then superior of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Hyacinthe. The foundress, Mere Catherine-Aurelie du Precieux Sang, commonly called Mere Caouette or Mother Catherine, died, 6 July, 1905, at the mother-house in St. Hyacinthe, of which she was then superioress. The object of the institution is two-fold: the glorification of the Precious Blood, and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. "To adore, to repair, to suffer", is the watch-word given to the sisters by the foundress. She was joined by Sister Euphrasie de Joseph, her cousin, Sister Sophie de l'Incarnation, niece of Monsignor Raymond, and Sister Elizabeth de l'Immaculee Conception, a convert. The constitutions of the institute were approved by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 20 October, 1896. The order is contemplative, and the sisters maintain perpetual adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. The Office is recited daily: on Thursday, the Office of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, which is also chanted when the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is exposed; every first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of the month, and during the Forty-Hours devotion, which by a special privilege of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> is held four times yearly. On Saturday the Office of the Blessed Virgin is said, and on all other days that of the Precious Blood. <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> are recited at midnight. The institute is governed by the mother superior, aided by her councillors, and in certain cases by the chapter of the community. The councillors and the mother superior are elected for a term of five years. Houses are independent of one another in government, recruiting, and training their members. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> lasts two years. The choir and lay sisters make perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; the <em>touri&egrave;res</em> (out-sisters) pronounce their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> for a year only, being allowed to renew them afterwards on the Feast of the Precious Blood. The choir sisters dress in white, with a red <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> and <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a> on which are <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in white the instruments of the Passion; for Communion, and before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> when exposed, they wear a white mantle. Hence their popular name, "the white <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>". The lay sisters have the same costume, but the dress is black. The costume of the <em>touri&egrave;res</em> is all black, as their functions call them out of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. The institute subsists on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and on the work of some of the sisters, who make everything requisite for the service of the altar, and other <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> articles. The institute also directs the Confraternity and the Guard of Honour of the Precious Blood, and spiritual retreats for ladies.

<p>From the mother-house at St. Hyacinthe have sprung many branches: Toronto (Ontario, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>), 1867; <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>), 1874; Ottawa (Canada), 1887; <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> (Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>), 1889; Brooklyn (New York), 1890; Portland (Oregon), 1891; Sherbrooke (Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>), 1895; Nicolet (Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>), 1896; Manchester (N.H.), 1898; Havana (Cuba), 1902; Levis (Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>), 1906; and Joliette (Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>), 1907.
<h2 id="section4">Sisters of the Precious Blood</h2>

<p>A congregation of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> founded at Gurtweil, Baden. In 1857 Rev. Herman Kessler, the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, who had long desired to establish a home for destitute children and a normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the training of religious teachers, asked for six members of the community of the Sisters of the Precious Blood from Ottmarsheim, Alsace. They responded and began their work with twelve poor children under the direction of Father Kessler. Under the auspices of Archbishop von Vicari of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were established; the latter was affiliated with the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> department of Karlsruhe. Other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and academies were opened. In 1869 Bishop Junker of <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">Alton</a>, Ill., asked for sisters for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1870 a number of sisters sailed for Belle Prairie (now Piopolis) in the <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">Diocese of Alton</a>. Meantime Bishop Baltes succeeded Bishop Junker; he entrusted to them several <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and promised further assistance on condition that the community should establish itself permanently in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> subject to his authority. Mother Augustine, superior of the mother-house at Gurtweil, apprehended a premature separation from Gurtweil, and was also opposed to limiting the sisters' activity to one diocese only. She went to St. Louis where through the efforts of Father Muehlsiepen, Vicar- General of St. Louis, the Sisters of the Precious Blood were received into the Archdiocese of St. Louis (1872) and obtained charge of a number of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a> and Nebraska. In 1873 the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a> had reached its climax and the entire community was expelled; some went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, others settled in Bosnia, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, while the greater number joined their sisters in America. A mother-house was established in O'Fallon, St. Charles County, Mo., completed in 1875. News arrived that Mother Clementine, mistress of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, with a few professed sisters and the entire <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> had resolved to follow the dictates of Bishop Baltes and establish a mother-house in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Consequently a new <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was begun in O'Fallon. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of Mother Clementine's branch was established at Ruma in 1876. They conduct <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the Archdiocese of St. Louis, the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">Alton</a>, <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a>, <a href="../cathen/11230c.htm">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">Wichita</a>. They number (1911): professed sisters, 230; <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 20; candidates, 30; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 51; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, 150; pupils, 49,430. The O'Fallon community was incorporated (1878) under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">State of Missouri</a> with the right of succession, under the legal title of St. Mary's Institute of O'Fallon, Mo. The sisters conduct <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the Archdiocese of St. Louis, and in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">Alton</a>, <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>, Lincoln, and <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>. They number (1911): professed sisters, 179; <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 17; candidates, 11; academy, 1; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 20; pupils, 2943.
<h2 id="section5">Sisters of the Precious Blood</h2>

<p>Founded in the canton of Grisons, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, in 1833, by Maria Anna Brunner, and her son <a href="../cathen/03012a.htm">Rev. Francis de Sales Brunner</a>. They were inspired to the undertaking by a visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, during which they were much impressed by the devotion to the Most Precious Blood as practised by the congregation of <a href="../cathen/06390b.htm">[Saint] Gaspare del Bufalo</a>. The rule was founded on that of St. Benedict and approved by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a>, the object of the community being the adoration of the Most Precious Blood and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth, including the care of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and homeless or destitute girls. The sisters became affiliated with the Society of Priests of the Precious Blood, of which <a href="../cathen/03012a.htm">Father Brunner</a> was a member, and on his being sent to America to establish his congregation there he enabled the sisters also to make a foundation, first at St. Alphonsus, near Norwalk, and permanently at New Riegel, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. In 1886 Archbishop Elder found it advisable to revise the rule drawn up by <a href="../cathen/03012a.htm">Father Brunner</a> in order to adapt it to altered conditions, and this revision, besides extending the time of adoration through the day as well as the night, increased the teaching force of the community, who were thus enabled to take charge of a larger number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In this year, also, the sisters were separated from the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, with which it had hitherto been affiliated, and made a separate congregation with a superior general under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. The present mother-house is at Maria Stein, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. They conduct <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Archdiocese of Cincinnati</a>, and in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, Ft. Wayne, <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>, <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Nashville</a>, <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15084b.htm">Tucson</a>. The statistics for 1911 are: professed sisters, 592; <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 48; <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>, 26; pupils, 6954.
