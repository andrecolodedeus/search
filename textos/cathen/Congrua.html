<h1>Congrua</h1>  

<p>Congrua (i.e. CONGRUA PORTIO), a canonical term to designate the lowest sum proper for the yearly income of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>. It is sometimes used in the same sense as <em><a href="../cathen/04186b.htm">competency</a></em>. Owing to the many charges to which a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> is liable, it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority to <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> that first and foremost the proper sustenance of the holder of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> should be provided for, and that a minimum revenue should be determined, below which his income was not to fall. This was all the more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in cases where <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> had been incorporated with <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> or collegiate churches. Very often the <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of such incorporated <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> received only one-sixteenth of the revenue. To remedy this abuse a number of ordinances were passed which reserved to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> having <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> a decent subsistence. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXI, c. iv, de Ref.) leaves the determination of the congrua to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This sum must, of course, vary with the fluctuation of values at different times. It must not be so parsimoniously fixed as to provide for the beneficiary the mere necessaries of life. To be a proper income in accordance with the dignity of his state, it should likewise be sufficient to enable him to dispense moderate hospitality and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> and supply himself with books, etc. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> did not determine the amount of the congrua. It suggested, however, that about one-third of the revenue of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> should be assigned to the vicar. When the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> can not furnish a proper sustenance, it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to see that several <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> be united or that the deficit be made up from other sources, as <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, collections, etc. If these means fail, the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> must be suppressed. It is to be noted that in determining the congrua the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can not take into consideration emoluments that are uncertain, such as offerings at funerals or <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, or Mass stipends; nor what the vicar might earn by his labour; nor what he receives from his patrimony; for these are not fruits of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. When the congrua has been fixed for a certain <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, it is always presumed to be sufficient, unless it be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have been lessened. Hence, if the beneficiary declare the congrua to be insufficient, especially when it has sufficed for his predecessors, the burden of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> rests on him. If the congrua had been sufficient at the time a pension was reserved to another from the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> and later became insufficient, the amount <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to provide proper sustenance must be taken from the pension, for those who have <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> are to be preferred to pensioners. Even a <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> who is removable and a temporary vicar are to have a congrua assigned to them. Although, in speaking of the congrua, authors generally limit the question to the inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, yet all rectors of churches, hence also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, are entitled to it. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, cap. xiii) declared that a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> whose revenue did not exceed one thousand <em>scudi</em> (about one thousand dollars) should not be burdened with pensions or reservations. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is entitled to an income that will allow him to live according to his dignity. If he have a coadjutor, the ordinary must provide a congrua for him. In many <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries, where <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> has passed into the possession of the State, the civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> have determined the congrua of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> more or less liberally. Such <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are yet in force in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and until the end of 1905 existed in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The salary for rectors of churches in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> fixed by plenary or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, has nothing in common with the canonical congrua.
