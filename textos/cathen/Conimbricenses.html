<h1>Conimbricenses</h1>  

<p>(Or Collegium Conimbricenses).

<p>The name by which <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04095c.htm">University of Coimbra</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> were known. On the register of the college at various times appeared the names of two hundred <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> including professors and students. Toward the end of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth, voluminous commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> writings of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> went forth from the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. These commentaries were dictations to the students by the professors and as such were not intended for publication. Still they were actually published, but <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulently</a>. In order to interpret and disown incorrect and unauthorized editions, Father Claudius Acquaviva, the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, assigned Father Peter Fonseca, the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> province, the task of supervising the revision of these commentaries for publication. Father Fonseca was widely known as the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The different treatises appeared in the following order: <ol> <li>"Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in octo libros physicorum Aristotelis Stagyrit&aelig;" (Coimbra, 1591); <li>"Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in quattuor libros physicorum Aristotelisde Coelo" (Coimbra, 1592); <li>Commentarii etc. in libros meteorum Aristotelis Stagyrit&aelig; (Coimbra, 1592); <li>Commentarii etc. in libros Aristotelis qui parva naturalia appelantur (Coimbra, 1592); <li>Commentarii etc. in libros Ethicorum Aristotelis ad Nichomachum aliquot Cursus Conimbricensis disputationes in quibus pr&aelig;cipua quaedam Ethic&aelig; disciplin&aelig; capita continentur (Coimbra, 1595); <li>Commentarii etc. in duos libros Aristotelis de generatione et coruptione" (Coimbra, 1595); <li>Commentarii etc. in tres libros Aristotelis de Anim&acirc; (Coimbra, 1592). This treatise was published after the death of Father Emmanuel Golz (whom Father Fonseca had commissioned to publish the earlier volumes by Father Comas Maggalliano (Magalh&aelig;ns). To it he added a treatise of Father Balthazaar Alvarez "De Anim&acirc; Separat&acirc;" and his own work "Tractatio aliquot problematum ad quinque Sensus Spectantium". <li>Commentarii etc. in universam dialecticam nunc primum (ed. <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1606). </ol> To this last treatise was prefixed a forward disowning any connection whatever with the work published at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfurt</a> in 1604 and claiming to be the "Commentarii Conimbricenses". The portion of the preface referred to is substantially the following: "Before we could finish the task entrusted to us of editing our Logic, to which we were bound by many promises, certain German publishers <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulently</a> brought out a work professing to be from us, abounding in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and inaccuracies which were really their own. They also substituted for our commentaries certain glosses gotten furtively. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> these writings thirty years previously were the work of one of our professors not indeed intended for publication. They were the fruit of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and he never dreamed they would appear in print. The last treatise was prepared for printing by Father Sebastian Couto. The entire eight parts formed five quarto volumes, enjoyed a wide circulation, and appeared in many editions, the best known being those of Lyon, <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, and Colgne. The Commentaries are in flowing Latin and are supplemented by reliable explanations of the text and exhaustive discussion of the system of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. Karl Werner says that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of Coimbra gave the world a masterpiece, whose equal is yet to be seen and which has received the admiration it deserves. <a href="../cathen/02190c.htm">Father de Backer</a> gives an exact list of all the editions. The later ones have added the Greek text of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>.
