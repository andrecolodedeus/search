<h1>Conrad Celtes</h1>  

<p>(Properly C<font size=-2>ONRAD</font> P<font size=-2>ICKEL,</font> or M<font size=-2>EISEL</font>; called also in Latin P<font size=-2>ROTUSIUS</font>).

<p>A German Humanist, b. at Wipfeld in Lower Franconia, 1 February, 1459; d. at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 4 February, 1508. He pursued his studies at Cologne (1477) and Heidelberg (1484), and at the latter <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> received the stimulating instruction of such men as Dalberg and Agricola. After this he wandered about for a time as a "travelling scholar", delivering <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> lectures at Erfurt, <a href="../cathen/13205b.htm">Rostock</a>, and Leipzig. While at Leipzig he issued his first work, "Ars versificandi et carminum" (1486), as well as an edition of Seneca. In 1486 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he had friendly relations with Pomponius L&aelig;tus; travelling through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he became acquainted at Florence with Marsilio Ficino, at Bologna with Beroaldus, and at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> with Sabellicus and the celebrated printer, Aldus Manutius.

<p>On the return of Celtes to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> Frederick III, at the instance of the Elector Frederick of Saxony, <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him Poet Laureate. This <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> took place with much pomp at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, and he received, at the same time, a doctor's degree. Soon after this Celtes made a wandering tour throughout the whole of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In the course of his travels he went to Cracow (c. 1488), where he busied himself with mathematics and the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and formed friendships with a number of able Humanists, such as Lorenzo Rab and Bonacursius. In imitation of the Roman Academy (see <a href="../cathen/01083b.htm">A<font size=-2>CADEMIES,</font> R<font size=-2>OMAN</font></a>) he founded at Cracow a learned <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> called the <em>Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana,</em> and another, entitled the <em>Sodalitas Litterarum Hungarorum</em> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, to which country he proceeded by way of Prague and <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>. The name of this latter association was afterwards changed to <em>Sodalitas Litterarum Danubiana,</em> and its seat was transferred to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1494). On the return journey Celtes stopped at <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, and went as far as <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and Heidelberg, where the <em>Sodalitas Litterarum Rhenana</em> was founded. On a second tour, in 1491, he reached L&uuml;beck, where his efforts to form an association of scholars <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unsuccessful. In 1494 he became professor at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>; this position, however, put no check on his propensity for wandering, and when the pest raged at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a> he was at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a> as tutor to the Palatine princes. In 1497 the emperor called him to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he gave <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> and historical lectures, some of which were on the works of classic writers, as Apuleius, Cicero, Tacitus, etc.

<p>The lectures of Celtus were as permanent in their effects on the advancement and spread of the spirit of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> learning as was the founding of his various learned associations. Especially was he of great importance for the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of history, in that he was the first to treat the history of the world as a whole, and to bring the history of the empire into connexion with that of other nations. His greatest labour, however, the "Germania Illustrata", a work in which he desired to preserve the results both of his long journeys and of his researches in the history of the empire, remained a fragment. He gained a name for himself in the literary world by the discovery and publication of the writings of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> <a href="../cathen/07504b.htm">Roswitha (Hroswitha)</a>. although Eschbach's assumption that Celtes had forged these works excited for a time serious discussion, yet K&ouml;pke and others succeeded in clearing him of this charge (Ottonische Studien, II). Still further literary credit is due Celtes for his publication of the "Ligurinus" of G&uuml;nther, and for the discovery of the "Tabula Peutingeriana" (a map of the military roads of the Roman Empire). No less creditable to his literary sagacity is the collection of Greek and Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which he made as librarian of the imperial library founded by Maximilian I at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. He also won fame as a poet, and was the guiding spirit of the Poets' Academy at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, the first institution of this kind to be established. Nevertheless his "IV Libri Amorum", "IV Libri Odarum", and "V Libri Epigrammatum" are works of no great merit; their contents are in part very free, if not erotic. Celtes was an Epicurean, and, like many of the more <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinking</a> Humanists, in his concept of the standards of life he placed a higher value on the ancient <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, than on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, ideal. On this point he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to bear much blunt reproof from his friend, <a href="../cathen/12108b.htm">Charitas Pirkheimer</a>.
