<h1>Conrad of Hochstadt</h1>  

<p>(CONRAD OF HOSTADEN)

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> and Imperial Elector (1238-1261), and son of Count Lothar of Hochstadt and Mathilde of Vianden, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. 28 September, 1261. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of his early youth. In 1216 he became beneficiary of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Wevelinghoven near Dusseldorf; in 1226 he was canon and, some years later, <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Cologne. After the death of Henry of Molenark (26 March, 1238) the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter elected Conrad <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. He received the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> insignia from the Emperor Frederic II at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> in August of the same year. The following year, 28 October, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by Ludolf of Munster.

<p>During the first few months of his reign the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was on the side of the emperor in his conflict with <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a>, but for unknown reasons went over to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> party shortly after the emperor's <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (12 March, 1239). The whole temporal administration of Conrad was a series of struggles with some neighbouring princes and with the citizens of Cologne, who refused to acknowledge the temporal sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> over their city. Conrad was generally victorious, but his often treacherous manner of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> has left many dark spots on his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. When <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Pope Innocent IV</a> deposed Frederic II (17 July, 1245), it was chiefly due to the influence of Conrad that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> candidate, Henry Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia, was elected king, and when Henry died after a short reign of seven months (17 February, 1247), it was again the influence of Conrad that placed the crown on the head of the youthful William of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>.

<p>In recognition of these services, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Pope Innocent</a> made him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (14 March, 1249), an office which had become <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> by the death of Archbishop Sifrit of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, five days previously. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> desired to have the powerful Conrad of Cologne as their new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Conrad seems to have secretly encouraged them, but for diplomatic reasons referred them to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who kindly but firmly refused to place the two most important ecclesiastical provinces of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> under the power of one man. Shortly after this decision the hitherto friendly relations between <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Pope Innocent IV</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> ceased, and in April, 1250, the Apostolic legation in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was committed to Peter, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>. At the same time began Conrad's estrangement from King William, which finally led to open rebellion. With all the means of a powerful and unscrupulous prince, Conrad attempted to dethrone William and would probably have been successful had not the king's premature death made the intrigues of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> unnecessary. After the death of King William (28 January, 1256), Conrad played an important but despicable role in the election of the new king. For a large sum he sold his vote to <a href="../cathen/13045a.htm">Richard of Cornwall</a>, brother of Henry III of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, 17 May, 1257. This was the last important act of Conrad. He is buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Cologne, of which he laid the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a>, 15 August, 1248.
