<h1>Conrad of Marburg</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">Confessor</a> of Saint Elizabeth of Thuringia and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> inquisitor, b. at or near Marburg, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, in the second half of the twelfth century; d. 30 July, 1233. His contemporaries called him <em>Magister,</em> a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that he had finished the course of studies at some <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, perhaps <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> or Bologna. According to the Thuringian court-chaplain Berthold, and <a href="../cathen/03137a.htm">C&aelig;sarius of Heisterbach</a>, he was probably a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, therefore neither a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, as Hausrath states, nor a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, as is asserted by Henke and others. Papal letters and contemporary chroniclers describe Conrad as a man of much ability, large <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> learning, great eloquence, ardent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in defence of the purity of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and a severe ascetic. They also agree as to the sternness of his character. He is first heard of as a vigorous preacher of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> proclaimed in 1213 by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. The death of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> and the consequent relaxation of interest in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, did not dampen the ardour of Conrad, while, in addition, he was charged with various important commissions. <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> authorized him (1219) to adjust the differences of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Nihenburg with the Duke of Saxony and the Count of Askanien. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Hayna, the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of St. Stephen, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and Conrad were appointed in 1227 <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commissioners for the separation of Marburg from the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Oberweimar. The synod of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (1225) had issued several decrees for the improvement of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and Conrad was intrusted with their execution; he was also charged with the reform of certain <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, as Nordhausen. In 1232 he describes himself as <em>visitator monasteriorum in Alemanni&#226;</em>. In the course of these labours Conrad became acquainted with the Landgrave Ludwig of Thuringia and his wife, St. Elizabeth. The prince held Conrad in high esteem, and the latter exercised great influence at the Thuringian court, being authorized by Ludwig to appoint to all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices in the gift of the landgrave. This power of appointing to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> livings was confirmed (12 June, 1227) by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> (Mon. Germ. Hist.: Epistol&aelig; S&aelig;c XIII, ed. Rodenberg, I, 276, n. 361).

<p>In 1225, after the recall of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Rodeger, Conrad became the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> and confessor of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> landgravine. He treated her with the same severity that he used against himself, a procedure in accordance with her own wishes. At times, however, he checked her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and forbade excessive <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a>. Conrad has been often blamed, quite <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, for the direction, in keeping with the custom of the time, which he imparted to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of St. Elizabeth. After the death of St. Elizabeth on 19 November, 1231, Conrad was deputed, with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Eberbach, to examine witnesses concerning her life and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> attributed to her intercession. He also wrote for the process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> a short life of St. Elizabeth. In his later years Conrad was very active in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> inquisitor. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the Catharists and the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a> were spreading throughout the land; to Catharism, in particular, was owing the fantastic <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Luciferians (see Michael, Geschichte des deutschen Volkes, II, 266). From the beginning fo the thirteenth century the German <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, in union with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>, had proceeded vigorously against all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. The conflict in which Conrad had so large a share was waged according to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> views of public right and welfare. The first process in which he took part was that directed against Heinrich Minnike, Provost of Goslar. In 1224 after a trial that lasted two years, Minnike was declared guilty of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, delivered to the secular arm, and perished at the stake. In the following years Conrad preached with great vigour against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and was warmly praised and encouraged to greater <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> in a letter of 1227. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> both wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1231 in praise of the extraordinary activity of Conrad and reported his triumphs over several <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> leaders. Thereupon <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory</a> conferred on Conrad (11 October, 1231) the extensive authority of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> inquisitor, the first such officer appointed in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> released Conrad from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of following the ordinary canonical procedure (<em>te a cognitionibus causarum habere volumus excusatum</em>) and authorized him to proceed resolutely against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as he thought best, but with due observance of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decrees on the subject.

<p>In the exercise of this authority, even according to the sympathetic accounts of contemporary <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a>, Conrad <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> too severe and harsh. His assistants, Conrad Dorso, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, and John, a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> fanatics unqualified for such work. Conrad believed too easily the declarations of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; on the strength of their statements, and without further investigation, others were arrested and treated as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. The accused either confessed their guilt and had their heads shaved for penance, or denied their guilt, were delivered as obstinate <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the secular arm, and perished at the stake. How great was the number of victims cannot now be ascertained. In western <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> a general panic followed the appearance of this severe judge of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who did not fear to summon before his tribunal powerful nobles, suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, among such the Count of Sayn. The count appealed to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> who convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> of his suffragans (25 July, 1233), at which King Henry also assisted. Both the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the influential nobles were generally ill-disposed towards Conrad, who was present at the synod, and it was found impossible to prove the charge of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> against the Count of Sayn. Thereupon Conrad undertook, in the exercise of his <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commission, to preach a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> nobles. Shortly afterwards (30 July, 1233) both he and his companion, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Gerhard Lutzelkolb, were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> while returning to Marburg. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in Marburg near St. Elizabeth. Despite the unfavourable action of the synod of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> extended his protection to the memory of the deceased inquisitor and insisted that severe punishment be meted out to his murderers.
