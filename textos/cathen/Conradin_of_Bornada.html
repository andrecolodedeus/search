<h1>Conradin of Bornada</h1>  

<p>(Or CONRADIN OF BRESCIA)

<p><a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> preacher, b. in the latter part of the fourteenth century; d. at Bologna, 1 November, 1429. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, noble and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescians</a>, were devoted adherents of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in a time of many ills, including the great <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>. They gave their son a careful <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and sent him, at the age of sixteen, to study civil and canon law at the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>. There for five years amid the perils of the unbridled licence and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> disorders of the times, the youth was conspicuous for both talent and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, winning the esteem of his masters and compelling the respect of his fellow-students. He entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at Padua in 1419, and was speedily found to be a model of religious observance. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> found fruitful expression in his eloquent preaching. He was made <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> and shortly afterwards, by appointment of the master general, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Dominic at Bologna, where he was to restore strict observance. During a visitation of the black plague he displayed heroic <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and intrepidity in ministering to the stricken people. Amid political upheavals, when Bologna under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/02483a.htm">Bentivogli</a> had revolted against <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, Conradin took a firm stand against the conduct of the misguided populace. For publishing the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">papal interdict</a>, which they had incurred but which they had disregarded, he was twice seized and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, suffering many indignities and cruelties. His <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> bearing and constant mediation finally prevailed, however, and peace was restored. <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a>, in recognition of his services, sought to create him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resolutely declined the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The plague breaking out anew, Conradin fell a victim to his charity and died in the midst of his heroic ministrations. His early biographers generally refer to him as Blessed.
