<h1>Constance</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>Constantia</em>, <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a> <em>Konstanz</em> or <em>Constanz</em>, <a href="../cathen/04598b.htm">Czechic</a> name <em>Kostnitz</em>).

<p>Formerly the seat of a diocese. Constance, a very ancient town situated where the River Rhine flows out of the Bodensee (between the Bodensee and the Untersee) in the south-eastern part of the Grand Duchy of Baden, was originally a village of lake-dwellers which under Roman rule was fortified by Constantius Chlorus in 304. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> seems to have been introduced into Constance and the neighbouring country by Roman legionaries as early as the end of the second or the beginning of the third century. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was first at Vindonissa, the present Windisch in the Canton of Aargau in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. It is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when this see was erected. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of whom history has preserved any record is Bubulcus who was present at the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> Synod of Epaon in 517. (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Ampl. Coll. Conc., VIII, 565.) He was succeeded by Grammatius, who attended a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> synod at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> in 535 (ibid., VIII, 863), one at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 541 (ibid., IX, 120), and a third at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 549 (ibid., IX, 136). After this time history makes no further mention of the Diocese of Vindonissa. Since, however, the neighbouring city of Constance is for the first time mentioned as an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> about this time, it becomes almost a <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that from Vindonissa the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was transferred to Constance. The episcopal catalogues of Constance designate Maximus as the first and Rudolph as the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but nothing further is known about them. Walafrid Strabo, in his "Vita S. Galli", speaks of certain Gaudentius as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constance, after whose death (c. 613) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was offered to St. Gall who, however, refused the dignity and recommended his disciple John in his stead. The sermon which St. Gall preached at John's <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is still extant (H. Canisius, "Antiqu&aelig; Lectiones", edited by Basnage, "Thesaurus monum. eccl. et hist.", <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1725, I, 785). Nothing is known of Marcian, Boso, Gangolf, Fidelis, and Rudolph, who are generally designated as successors of John.

<p>The limits of the Diocese of Constance were fixed during the seventh century. The river Iller separated it from the <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Diocese of Augsburg</a>. From the influx of the Iller into the Danube the boundary turned towards the north-west past Gm&uuml;nd, across the Neckar, north of Marbach, thence south-westerly till it reached the Rhine south of Breisach (Altbreisach). It followed the Rhine upward to the influx of the Aar, then up this river to the St. Gotthard, whence it turned north-easterly across Canton St. Gall to the source of the Iller. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> surrounding it were Augsburg, <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, Basle, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>, <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a>, and (since 742) <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. There was not a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> which surpassed Constance either in area or population. It belonged to the province of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> until it became a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 747. With few changes it retained the above-mentioned dimensions till the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. In the year 1435 the diocese had 17,060 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 1760 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 350 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. During the eighth and ninth centuries the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Constance repeatedly infringed upon the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Abbots of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> and St. Gall and sometimes combined the abbatial with the episcopal dignity. Bishop Sidonius (746-760) was instrumental in the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> deposition and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of <a href="../cathen/11351a.htm">St. Othmar</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Gall, in 758 or 759 (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, Conciliengeschichte, III, 596). Most <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the tenth century were great and holy men. Solomon III (890-919) had previously (885) been imperial chancellor and was equally beloved as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> and St. Gall and as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constance. St. Conrad (934-975) was a great friend of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, made three <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the Holy Land, built three new churches and renovated many old ones. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1123 and became patron of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. St. Gebhard II (979-995) founded the Abbey of Petershausen in 983, began to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint soon after his death, and became patron of the city of Constance. During the conflict between <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>, concerning the right of investiture, the episcopal See of Constance was occupied by <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> (1071-1086), who sided with the emperor and was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> because he took part in the deposition of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> at the Synod of Worms (1076). His successor <a href="../cathen/06402a.htm">Gebhard III</a> (1084-1110) was an intrepid defender of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> against Henry V, became Vicar Apostolic for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> under <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Ampl. Coll. Conc., XX, 666 and 715), <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Constance in 1089, held a synod in 1094, at which wholesome <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms were decreed, and with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> freed Henry V from the ban in 1095. During the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> conflicts with the Emperors <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick I</a> and <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sided with the emperors until Bishop Henry I, von Thann (1233-1248) returned to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> allegiance in 1246. Bishop Rudolph von Montfort (1322-1334) supported <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> in his struggle against Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> until 1332, when he joined the party of the emperor. His successor Nicholas, von Kreuzlingen (1334-1344), sided with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. While the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> was in session (1414-1418) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of Constance was occupied by <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, von Hochberg (1411-1434). From the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Constance were princes of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. Their territory, as temporal rulers, extended over twenty-two German (about 482 English) square miles, with a population of about 50,000, and lasted until it was divided between Baden and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in 1802.

<p>The decline of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> begins with the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Cantons Zurich, Bern, St. Gall, Schaffhausen, and Thurgau were first to adopt the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> (Zwinglianism). They were followed in 1526 by the city of Constance and in 1534 by the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>. Baden became <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> in 1556, but here the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was restored in 1571. The old Faith was also slowly restored in the city of Constance from 1548 when that city came under Austrian rule. From 1526 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Constance resided at Meersburg. Despite the great losses sustained during the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, the diocese in 1750 still numbered 3774 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 2764 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, 3147 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 891,948. In 1814 the portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> situated on <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> territory was detached and apportioned to the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a>, Basle, and St. Gall. After the death of Bishop Karl Theodor von Dalberg in 1817, the portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> lying in <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> came under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of Ellwangen-Rottenburg, and all the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> territory was attached to the <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Diocese of Augsburg</a>. In 1821 <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a> dissolved the Diocese of Constance and joined its remaining territory to the newly erected <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Archdiocese of Freiburg</a>. The most important rulers of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> were: Cardinal Marcus Sitticus von Hohenems (Altemps), 1561-1589; Cardinal Andrew of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1589-1600), Jacob Fugger (1604-1626), Karl Theodor von Dalberg (1810-1817) and his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> <a href="../cathen/15590b.htm">Heinrich Ignaz von Wessenberg</a>. The last two espoused the <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">doctrine of Febronius</a>. Dalberg joined the <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasons</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07661b.htm">Illuminati</a>, of whose real tendencies he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15590b.htm">Wessenberg</a> was heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for the anti-ecclesiastical reforms of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>.

<p>The city of Constance received municipal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in 780, became a free imperial city in 1192 and was one of the largest and most flourishing cities of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Its population is said to have exceeded 40,000. Here the famous Peace of Constance, a treaty between <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> and the Lombard cities was declared in 1183 and an imperial diet was convened by Maximilian I in 1507. Commercially it was highly important on account of its manufacture of choice linen the famous tela di Costanza which was known throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> renown it owes to the fact that it was the seat of perhaps the largest diocese in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and that from 1414-18 the Sixteenth Ecumenical Council was celebrated there. For joining the Smalkaldic League and refusing to accept the Interim of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in 1548, it was deprived of its privileges as a free and imperial city and given to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the Swedes in 1633, pillaged by the French (1740-45), and finally joined to Baden in 1805. Its population in 1900 consisted of 15,917 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 711 <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>, and 565 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.
