<h1>Constant Fouard</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer b. at Elbeuf, near <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, 6 Aug. 1837; his early life was a preparation for the work on which his fame rests. He studied the classics at Boisguillaume, philosophy at Issy (1855-1857), and made his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at St-Sulpice, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1857-61). Along his professors at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> were Abb&eacute; John Logan, who remained throughout life the inspirer and mentor of his studies and <a href="../cathen/09133c.htm">Abbe Le Hir</a>, who initiated him and his fellow disciple Vigouroux into Biblical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, to which they devoted their lives. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1861 and entered the "Solitude", the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, but left on account of illness after several months without joining the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. He taught for some time at Boisguillaume, then pursued the study of classics at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/02284d.htm">Saint Barbara</a>, Paris, obtained the degree of Licentiate in Letters, 1867, and resumed; the teaching of classics at Boisguillaume, taking the class of rhetoric, 1867-1876. His <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> drawing him to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>, he was appointed by the State (1876) to the chair of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> in the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>; he continued however to reside at Boisguillaume and to share in the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of governing the student-body.

<p>Honours came to him: he was made doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> (1877), canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> (1884) and member of the <a href="../cathen/02557a.htm">Biblical Commission</a> (1903). His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, his spiritual wisdom were continually at the service of religion in his native diocese. For the benefit of his studies he travelled in Palestine, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The Faculty of Theology being suppressed about 1884, his teaching ceased. His writings are: "La Vie de N-S J&eacute;sus-Christ" (1880); "Saint Pierre et les premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es du Christianisme" (1886); "Saint Paul, ses Missions" (1892); "Saint Paul, ses derni&egrave;res annees" (1897); "Saint Jean et la fin de age apostolique" (posthumous, 1904). The dates witness, incidentally, to the extremely painstaking character of his labours. All these books form part of one grand work, "Les Origines de l'&Eacute;glise", which Fouard wrote as an answer to the presentation of the same subject by Renan, who like himself had seen a pupil of <a href="../cathen/09133c.htm">le Hir</a>. Each successive book of the Abb&eacute; Fouard immediately gained a wide popularity and was translated into nearly all the language of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>His work is esteemed for the interest of its narratives, the purity of its diction, its correctness in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, its conservative but not reactionary critical viewpoint, its breadth and accuracy of erudition, and for its evidently sincere <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, the manifestation of a good and gentle spirit, loving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, delighting in nature, and earnestly desiring to do good to men. With one touch of genius or greater depth of feeling (gifts which were denied him), he might have fused the various elements of his writings into a truly great work. His works are not remarkable in originality of view or acuteness of critical insight, but present, as a whole, a faithful picture of early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, satisfying to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> heart. Perhaps his most esteemed books are the two on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saint Paul</a>. The English translation of his writings is exceptionally well done.
