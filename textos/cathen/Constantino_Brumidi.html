<h1>Constantino Brumidi</h1>  

<p>An Italian-American historical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, celebrated for his fresco work in the Capitol at Washington, b. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1805; d. at Washington, 19 February, 1880. His father was a native of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and his mother a Roman. He showed his talent for fresco <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> at an early age and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in several Roman palaces, among them being that of Prince Torlonia. Under <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> he worked for three years in the Vatican. The occupation of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the French in 1849 apparently decided Brumidi to <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrate</a>, and he sailed for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, where he became naturalized in 1852. Taking up his residence in New York City the artist <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a number of portraits. Subsequently he undertook more important works, the principal being a fresco of the Crucifixion in St. Stephen's Church, for which he also executed a "Martyrdom of St. Stephen" and an "Assumption of the Virgin". In 1854 Brumidi went to the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">city of Mexico</a>, where he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as allegorical representation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>. On his way back to New York he stopped at Washington and visited the Capitol. Impressed with the opportunity for decoration presented by its vast interior wall spaces, he offered his services for that purpose to Quartermaster-General Meigs. This offer was accepted, and about the same time he was commissioned as a captain of cavalry. His first art work in the Capitol was in the room of the House Cornmittee on Agriculture. At first he received eight dollars a day, which Jefferson Davis, then Secretary of War of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, caused to be increased to ten dollars. His work attracting much favourable attention, he was given further commissions, and gradually settled into the position of a Government <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. His chief work in Washington was done in the rotunda of the Capitol and included the apotheosis of Washington in the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a>, as well as other allegories, and scenes from American history. His work in the rotunda was left unfinished at his death, but he had decorated many other of the building. In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Philadelphia he pictured St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Brumidi was a capable, if conventional <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, and his black and white modelling in the work at Washington, in imitation of <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-relief</a>, is strikingly effective.
