<h1>Constantino Cajetan</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> savant, born at <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, in 1560; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 17 September, 1650. While his brothers, Ottavio and Alfonso, joined the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, Constantino became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> (29 October, 1586) at San Nicol&ograve; d'Arena in <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a>, and was soon called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, who confided to the promising young scholar an edition of the works of <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>, which he executed in four folio volumes (Rome, 1606 <em>et saep.</em>). His constant and successful researches in Roman archives won him the friendship of Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, through whom he was made titular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of San Baronzio in the Diocese of Pistoia, and Custodian of the Vatican Library; the latter important office he held under four <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> until his death. <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> was much indebted to him in the composition of his "Annales Ecclesiastici", and more than once praises Cajetan's thorough <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Roman archives (e.g. <em>ad an.</em> 1002, n. 10). He was a tireless worker in the field of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>; the long list of his writings may be seen in <a href="../cathen/14463c.htm">Ziegelbauer</a>, "Hist. rei lit. O. S. B." (Augsburg, 1754, III, 360 sqq.). Among them are a life of the liturgist, St. Amalarius of Trier (Rome, 1612), annotated lives of St. Isadore of Seville, St. Ildephoses of Toledo, Cardinal Gregory of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, notes on the life of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, an annotated edition of the "Vita Gelasii II" by Pandolfo of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (Murat., Script. Rer. It., III, 367), treatises on the primacy and the Roman episcopate of St. Peter (Roccaberti, Bibl. max. pontif., VII). He was persuaded that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> was a genuine disciple of St. Benedict, and wrote in defiance of this thesis "De S. Gregorii monachatu benedictino libri duo" (Salzburg, 1620). The authorship of the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a> interested him also, and he several times broke a lance for the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Jean Gersen [Joannes Gersen, De Imit. Xti, acced. Defensio pro Gersen et methodo practic&acirc; IV librorum" (Rome, 1616); "Concertatio, Apologetica responsio" (Rome, 1618); "Libellus apologeticus pro Gersen" (Rome, 1644), the latter two against Rosweyde]. His ardour for the glory of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> troubled his judgment occasionally, says Father <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, e.g. when he claimed for it such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as St. Columbanus of <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>. He inaugurated the controversy concerning the authorship of the work known as the "Spiritual Excercises of St. Ignatius" by his book "De religios&acirc; S. Ignatii, sive S. Enneconis fundatoris soc. Jesu per Benedictinos institutione, deque libello exercitiorum ejusdem ab Exercitatorio Cisnerii desumpto" (Venice, 1641), in which he claimed priority for the "Exercitatorium Spirituale" of Garcias de Cisneros, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Montferrat (1455-1510). (See SPIRITUAL EXCERCISES.) Both this work and the "Achates, or reply of Giovanni Rho, S.J., were placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a> of Forbidden Books in 1646. Cajetan was an intelligent and munificent collector of books, and at his death left his fortune to the "Bibliotheca Aniciana", founded by him in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (<em>Gens Anicia</em>); the books have since been divided between the Propoganda Library and that of the Sapienza, or Roman University. To many his chief title to fame will seem to rest on his claim to be considered the first promoter, if not the founder, of the Propoganda College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He had long hoped to found at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a <em>Collegium Gregorianum de propogand&acirc; fide</em>, in which young <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> might be trained for foreign missions, after the spirit and teachings of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, Apostle of the Anglo-Saxons. He really opened a house of studies for this purpose in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Benedetto in Piscinula at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and this may be looked on as historically the germ of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. (Cf. his "De erectione collegii Gregoriani in Urbe epistola encyclica", Rome, 1622.) His <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was taken up seriously by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> (1621-23), and by him enlarged and modified until it took shape as the "<em>Collegium</em> [later <em>Urbanum</em>] <em>de propagand&acirc; fide</em>". However, the enlightened <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and pioneer labours of Dom Cajetan received due recognition by his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of first consultor of the new college. (See <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">COLLEGE OF PROPAGANDA</a>).
