<h1>Constantinople</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>Konstantinoupolis</em>; city of Constantine)

<p>Capital, formerly of the Byzantine, now of the Ottoman, Empire.
<h2>The modern city</h2>

<p>Constantinople occupies one of the most beautiful and advantageous sites in the world, uniting as it does <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> with <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and putting in communication the Black Sea and all Southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> with the greater part of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and even with distant America. It is surrounded by water on all sides except the west, which is protected by walls. Its sea front is about eight miles in length. The air is generally pure, and the climate very temperate. Constantinople forms a special district (sanitary cordon) divided into three principal sections, two in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and one in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. The two <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> sections are Stamboul (ancient Byzantium), whose suburbs border the Sea of Marmora; Galata and Pera, more or less <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeanized</a> quarters, with many villages rising in rows along the green hills that look down on the Golden Horn and the Bosporus. The <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> section is Scutari (Turk. Uskudar; Chrysopolis) and Kadi-Keui (Chalcedon), with their extensive suburbs on the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> shore of the Bosporus, the pleasant coasts of the Gulf of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, and the Isles of the Princes. The city is divided into ten quarters or circles, each with its own municipality. The population is estimated (1908) at 1,200,000 inhabitants, four-fifths of whom are in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. There are about 600,000 <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> or other <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>; the remainder include, in order of numerical importance, Greeks, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and foreigners of various nationalities.

<p>The Bosporus separates <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> from <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>; it is about eighteen miles long and varies in width from about half a mile to a mile and a half. The Golden Horn separates Stamboul from Galata and Pera, extends inland for about four and one-half miles and ends abruptly at the Valley of the Sweet Waters beyond Eyoub. Two wooden bridges unite Galata with Stamboul, which latter section is mostly inhabited by <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and still preserves its ancient ramparts with their towers and gates.

<p>The chief monuments of the city are: St. Sophia, the magnificent church built in the first half of the sixth century by the Emperor Justinian, now a mosque; about 2000 other mosques (e.g. the Suleimanieh, the Ahmedieh, the Bayazidieh, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> mosque, etc.); many ancient churches; beautiful fountains; imposing "turb&eacute;s", or <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of sultans and other great personages; the Seraskierat or <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> office, with its enormous tower; the Tcharshi, or bazaar (more than 10,000 merchants); Yedi-Kouleh or the Seven Towers Castle, where ambassadors and other men of note were often <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>; the palace of the public <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>; the large post office; the old seraglio of the sultans. The imperial museum has a remarkable collection of sarcophagi and another of cuneiform texts. In the Galata section the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> Tower (over 150 feet) attracts attention, as in Pera the residences of the ambassadors. Beyond, on the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> shore of the Bosporus are the large palaces of Dolma-Baghtch&eacute; and Tcheragan, also the Yildiz Kiosk, the residence of the reigning sultan. On the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> shore are the palace of Beylerbey, many beautiful mosques, and the great <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> cemetery at <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a>, the Selimieh barracks (largest in the world), the magnificent new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine, quite close to which is the little port of Ha&iuml;dar-Pasha, whence starts the railway line to Bagdad.
<h2>Early history of Byzantium</h2>

<p>Constantinople was founded c. 658 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> by a Greek colony from <a href="../cathen/10146a.htm">Megara</a>; the site was then occupied by the Thracian village of Lygos. The chief of the <a href="../cathen/10146a.htm">Megarian</a> expedition was Byzas, after whom the city was naturally called Byzantion (Lat. Byzantium). Despite its perfect situation, the colony did not prosper at first; it suffered much during the Medic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, chiefly from the satraps of Darius and Xerxes. Later on, its control was disputed by Laced&aelig;monians and Athenians; for two years (341-339 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) it held out against Philip of Macedon. It succeeded in maintaining its independence even against victorious <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was granted the title and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of an allied city, and its ambassadors were accorded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the same honours as those given to allied kings; it enjoyed, moreover, all transit <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> on the Bosporus. Cicero defended it in the Roman Senate, and put an end to the exactions of Piso. Later on, the Roman emperors entrusted the government of the city to pr&aelig;tors, at once civil and military magistrates, who maintained, however, the earlier democratic forms of government. For a while <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> placed it under the Governor of M&aelig;sia. The city continued prosperous to the reign of <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a>, when it sided with his rival, <a href="../cathen/11739a.htm">Pescennius Niger</a>. After a siege of three years (193-196) Severus razed to the ground its walls and public monuments, and made it subject to Perinthus or Heraclea in Thrace. But he soon forgave this resistance, restored its former privileges, built there the baths of Zeuxippus, and began the hippodrome. It was devastated again by the soldiers of <a href="../cathen/06366a.htm">Gallienus</a> in 262, but was rebuilt almost at once. In the long <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Constantine and Licinius (314-323) it embraced the fortunes of the latter, but, after his defeat at <a href="../cathen/03743a.htm">Chrysopolis</a> (Scutari), submitted to the victor.
<h2>The Christian city</h2>

<p>It has quite lately been established that Byzantium received its new name of Constantinople as early as the end of 324 (Cent&eacute;naire de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale des antiquaires de France, Paris, 1904, p. 281 sqq.). Nevertheless, the solemn inauguration of the new city did not occur until 11 May, 330; only after this date did the Court and Government settle permanently in the new capital. It was soon filled with sumptuous edifices like those of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; like the latter it was situated on seven hills and divided into fourteen regions; in the matter of privileges also it was similar to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Among the new public buildings were a senate house, forums, a capitol, circuses, porticoes, many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> (particularly that of the Holy Apostles destined to be the burial-place of the emperors). The most beautiful <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of antiquity were gathered from various parts of the empire to adorn its public places. In general the other cities of the Roman world were stripped to embellish the "New Rome", destined henceforth to surpass them all in greatness and magnificence. Traces of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> do not appear here before the end of the second or the beginning of the third century. In 212 <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> commemorates the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at the defeat of <a href="../cathen/11739a.htm">Pescennius Niger</a> (<a href="../fathers/0305.htm"><em>To Scapula</em> 3</a>: "C&aelig;cilius Capella in illo exitu Byzantino: Christiani gaudete"). About 190, an Antitrinitarian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, Theodotus the Currier, a native of Byzantium, was expelled from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> ("Phiosophoumena, VIII, xxxv; <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, "Adv. H&aelig;r., " liv). A probably reliable tradition makes the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/07242b.htm">Heraclea</a> in Thrace at the beginning of the third century. In the fifth century we meet with a spurious document attributed to a certain Dorotheus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> at the end of the third century, according to which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Byzantium was founded by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> St. Andrew, its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being his disciple Stachys (cf. <a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs9">Romans 16:9</a>). The intention of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> is plain: in this way the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is made inferior to that of Constantinople, St. Andrew having been chosen an Apostle by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> before his brother St. Peter, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>.



<p>The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Byzantium is St. Metrophanes (306-314), though the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> had perhaps been occupied during the third century. It was at first subject to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> authority of <a href="../cathen/07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>, and remained so, at least canonically, until 381, when the <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">Second Ecumenical Council</a> (can. iii) gave the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople the first place after the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>. (For the exact meaning of this canon see Hefele, Hist. des Counciles, tr., Leclercq, Paris, 1908, II, 24-27.) Fuller details are given in Fischer, "De patriarcharum Constantinopolitanorum" catalogis (Leipzig, 1894); Schermann, "Prophetenund Apostellegenden nebst J&uuml;ngerkatalogen des Dorotheus und verwandter Texte" (Leipzig, 1907); Vailh&eacute;, "Origines de l'Eglisede Constantinople" in "Echos d'Orient" (Paris, 1907), 287-295.

<p>Constantine had chosen this city as the new capital of the Roman Empire, but owing to his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and the needs of the State, he rarely resided there. His successors were even more frequently absent. Constantius, <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>, Jovian, and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> are found more habitually on the Danube or the Euphrates than on the Bosporus; they reside more regularly in Antioch than in New Rome. It was only under <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius the Great</a> (379-95) that Constantinople assumed definitive rank as capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. However, its ambitious <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> did not wait so long to forecast the future greatness of the new city. In 339 <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, and in 360 Eudoxius, quitted the great Sees of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> and Antioch for what was yet, canonically, a simple <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. Both the city and its inhabitants suffered much during the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> controversies; the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> held possession of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for forty years. Honourable mention is due to two of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: St. Alexander, whose resistance and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by the sudden death of Arius in Constantinople; and St. Paul the Confessor, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the Faith. We must add the eighty <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> simultaneously by <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Emperor Valens</a>. <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> restored religious peace in this Church early in the reign of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>. From the council of 381 may be said to date the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> fortunes of Constantinople. Its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> began thenceforth to claim and to exercise <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> over the six provinces of Thrace, hitherto subject to <a href="../cathen/07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>, and soon over the twenty-two provinces of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, originally subject to Ephesus and C&aelig;sarea. These <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of supremacy, though usurped, were acknowledged by the twenty-eighth canon of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451), from which time the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Constantinople ruled over about 420 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In 431 began an almost continuous conflict with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, that was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with success in 733, when an <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> emperor withdrew from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Illyricum, i.e. more than a hundred <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. About the end of the ninth century, when Photius broke with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, his own <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> included 624 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (51 <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a>, 51 exempt archbishoprics, and 522 suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>). At that time the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> certainly did not govern so great a number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. At this period, moreover, by its missionaries and its political influence, Constantinople attracted to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> nations, <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Serbs</a>, Russians, <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravians</a>, and Bulgars, and obtained in these northern lands a strong support against the Roman and <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> West.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> prosperity coincided with the political and municipal grandeur of the city. At the death of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius the Great</a> (395), when the Roman Empire was divided into two parts, Constantinople remained the centre and capital of the Eastern Empire. The Western Empire was destined soon to fall before the onslaughts of the barbarians. While its provinces were held by uncouth German tribes, Constantinople alone remained to represent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization and the greatness of the Roman name. Simultaneously the city was enlarged and embellished, particularly under Theodosius II, Justinian, Heraclius, and Basil the Macedonian. In 413 it reached its actual (1908) size on the right bank of the Golden Horn, under the city prefect, <a href="../cathen/01553c.htm">Anthemius</a>. In 625 Heraclius added the famous quarter of Blachern&aelig; with its <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> church of the Blessed Virgin, whose image was considered as the palladium of the city. The circumference of the walls was then (and still is) eleven or twelve miles. They were often rebuilt, especially under Tiberius III (c. 700), Anastasius II (714), Leo III (740), Nicephorus I (803), Theophilus (831), Michael VIII (1262), Andronicus II (1316), John VII (between 1431-1444). To protect the territory of Thrace from the invasions of the barbarians, Anastasius I, in the early part of the sixth century, built a great wall about fifty miles in length and about twenty feet in breadth from Silistria to the Lake of Derkoi. The ramparts of Constantinople had many gates: the principal one was the Golden Gate, the terminus of the Triumphal Way. On the Sea of Marmora numerous havens gave shelter to boats and barques; the present unique port of the Golden Horn had not yet been created. The strongly fortified Great Palace was a real town. Other splendid palaces adorned the city (Boucoleon, Chalk&eacute;, Blachern&aelig;); many graced the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> suburbs. Hundreds of churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, thousands of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, attested an intensely <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Sophia alone, the glory of Justinian's reign, owned 365 estates. How vast these domains were may be judged from a law of Heraclius (627) that established 625 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> as the number <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the service of St. Sophia. The little church of Blachern&aelig; had 75 endowed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. The names of at least 463 churches are known, 64 of which were dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. As early as 536, 68 superiors of local <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were present at a council in the city.

<p>So many rich churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, imperial or private palaces, not to speak of the luxury of the court and the great imperial dignitaries, naturally excited the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> of barbarian peoples. Constantinople had, therefore, to sustain numberless sieges; it was attacked in 378 by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, by the Avars and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> during the reign of Heraclius (610-41), by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> during the reign of Constantine Pogonatus (668-85), and again by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> under Moslemeh in 717; many times also by <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, Patzinaks, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a>, and Khazars. But the city always defied its besiegers, thanks to the solidity of its walls, often to the valour of its soldiers, but chiefly to the gold that it distributed in profusion. More grievous, perhaps, were the domestic conflicts that broke out in almost every new reign: the quarrels between the Blue and Green factions that clamoured for imperial favour in the races of the hippodrome; the conflagrations and earthquakes that sometimes levelled the city with the ground, e.g. the conflagration that broke out during the Nika revolt (532), on which occasion Justinian nearly lost his throne, more than 80,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were killed, and fire destroyed the greater part of the city.
<h2>Heresy and schism</h2>

<p>When Photius (d. 891) began the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> consummated by <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a> in 1054, the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> had, since the death of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> in 337, been formally out of communion with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> during 248 years (55 years on account of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, 11 on account of the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, 35 on account of Zeno's <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a>, 41 on account of <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>, 90 on account of <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>, 16 on account of the adulterous marriage of Constantine VI). On the whole, therefore, Constantinople had been out of communion with the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> one out of every two years. During this period nineteen <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Constantinople were open <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, some of them quite famous, e.g. <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>, Eudoxius, Macedonius, Nestorius, Acacius, Sergius, Pyrrhus. On the other hand must be mentioned several <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">St. Flavian</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>, <a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">St. Tarasius</a>, St. Methodius, and St. Ignatius, the opponent of Photius, whose virtues and literary fame compensate for the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a> of their confr&egrave;res. Nor can we omit illustrious <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and hymnographers like <a href="../cathen/13163a.htm">St.Romanus</a> (Melodus), the greatest <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> poet of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/10078b.htm">St. Maximus Confessor</a>, <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">St. Theodore</a>, the noble <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/14316c.htm">Studium (Stoudion)</a>, and many others who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> during the reigns of <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> emperors.

<p>Many councils were held in Constantinople, sometimes against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, sometimes in favour of them. Chief among these councils are: the ecumenical councils of 381, 553, 681, and 869; the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan Council</a> (692), very important for the history of canonical legislation; the councils of 712 and 878 which ratified, respectively, <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a> and the revolt of Photius against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Photius was not at once followed by its worst consequences. The learned but ambitious patriarch was yet living when union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> was re-established by Emperor Leo the Wise in 886; he <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> Photius to quit the patriarchal throne. From that time to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a> (1043-1049), in spite of the <em>Filioque</em> question, relations with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> were generally cordial. There were indeed, at the beginning of the tenth century, some difficulties caused by the emperor's fourth marriage, but in this conflict both the opposing <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> attempted to obtain from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> justification of their conduct. It was only under <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a> that the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> condition was finally confirmed, almost without any apparent motive and only through the bad will of this patriarch. After long and sharp disputes between the two Churches, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the imperial court, deposited, 15 July, 1054, on the altar of St. Sophia the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against the patriarch. This act resulted in a popular revolution. Five days later <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a> replied by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the "azymite" Latins. The weak-minded and lewd emperor, Constantine Monomachus, dared not resist the all-powerful patriarch. It must be noted, however, that, unhappily, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> had long been familiar to the minds and hearts of the Greeks. The first period of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was coeval, especially at Constantinople, with a remarkable literary revival, inaugurated as early as the tenth century by the Macedonian dynasty and carried to its perfection under the Comneni and the Pal&aelig;ologi. This revival, unfortunately, did not affect favourably the morality of the population, being chiefly an unconscious return to models of antiquity, indeed a kind of neo-paganism. We owe to it, however, beautiful works in literature, architecture, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>.
<h2>Imperial succession; Crusades; Latin Empire of Constantinople</h2>

<p>After the division of the Roman Empire in 395, Constantinople beheld the passage of many great dynasties: that of Theodosius, prolonged by adoption until 602; that of Heraclius, from 610 to 711, with intrusion of several usurpers; that of Leo the Isaurian, from 717 to 802; the Amorium dynasty from 820 to 867; that of Basil the Macedonian from 867 to 1057; finally from 1081 to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> conquest in 1204, that of the Comneni and the Angeli. Succession, of course, was not always regular; even in the legitimate dynasties <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and cruelty, it is well known, often marked the accession of an emperor. Sometimes the streets of the capital were on the same day decked with flowers and drenched with blood. Nevertheless, till the middle of the eleventh century, the empire held its own in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. The latter were now gradually supplanted by their coreligionists, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, who, towards the end of that century, occupied most of the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> peninsula and set up their capital at Nic&aelig;a, not far from Constantinople. Then began the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, that great overflow of the West towards the East, started by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> wish of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to deliver the Holy Sepulchre. Constantinople saw the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> for the first time in 1096. The contact between the two civilizations was not cordial; the Greeks gave generally to the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> an unkindly reception. They looked on them as enemies no less than the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, except that the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, marching in the name of Christ and backed by all the strength of the West, appeared much more dangerous than the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> were only too ready to treat the Greeks as mere unbelievers, and, but for the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, would have begun the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> with the capture of Constantinople.

<p>These sad quarrels and the fratricidal conflicts of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian nations</a> lasted nearly a century, until in 1182 Emperor Andronicus Comnenus, a ferocious tyrant, ordered a general massacre of the Latins in his capital. In 1190 the Greek patriarch, Dositheus, solemnly promised indulgences to any Greek who would <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> a Latin. These facts, together with the selfish views of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> and the domestic divisions of the Greeks, were enough to provoke a conflict. The Greek Emperor Alexius III had dethroned his brother and stripped his nephew of all <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> (1195); the latter sought a shelter in the West (1201), and, together with his brother-in-law, Emperor Philip of Swabia, with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and Boniface of Montferrat (chief of the projected <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>), he turned aside the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section4">Fourth Crusade</a> and directed the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, first to the siege of <a href="../cathen/15752a.htm">Zara</a> in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, and afterwards to Constantinople. In spite of the formal veto of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> laid siege to the city, which soon surrendered (17 July, 1203). Emperor Alexius III took flight. His brother, Isaac Angelus, was taken from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor, with his son Alexius IV. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> had hoped that the new emperors would keep their promises and reunite the two Churches; confident of this they wrote to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (August, 1203) to justify their behaviour. But the imperial promise was not kept; indeed, it could not be executed. In November, 1205, Alexius IV broke off all relations with the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>. Thereupon the hostility between the Greeks and the Latins was in almost daily evidence; brawls and conflagrations were continually taking place. Alexius IV and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> were dethroned and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> (February, 1204) by a usurper who took the name of Alexius V Murtzuphlos. The latter made haste to put his capital in a state of defence, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> began a second siege. After several onslaughts the city was taken (12 and 13 April, 1204) amid scenes of great cruelty; the slaughter was followed by an unbridled plunder of the countless treasures heaped up during so many centuries by the Byzantine emperors. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">holy relics</a> especially excited the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> of the Latin <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; Villehardouin asserts that there were but few cities in the West that received no sacred booty from this pillage. The official booty alone, according to the same historian, amounted to about eleven millions of dollars whose purchasing power was then of course much greater than at this day. The following 9 May, Baldwin, Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, became emperor; Boniface of Montferrat obtained Thessalonica and <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, various <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> fees; <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, the islands and those regions of the empire that assured her maritime supremacy. This new Latin Empire, organized according to <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> law, never took deep root. It was unable to hold its own against the Greeks (who had immediately created two empires in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, at Nic&aelig;a and at <a href="../cathen/15028a.htm">Trebizond</a>, a despotate in Epirus and other small States) nor against the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, Comans, and Serbs. After a much-disturbed existence it disappeared in 1261, and Constantinople became again the centre of Greek power with Michael Pal&aelig;ologus as emperor.
<h2>Latin patriarchate</h2>

<p>Together with the Latin Empire a Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> had been established in 1204 at Constantinople, on which occasion the Greek patriarch took refuge at Nic&aelig;a. Notwithstanding the missions of Cardinal Benedict a Sancta Susanna (1205-1207) and Pelagius of Albano (1213), negotiations, and even persecutions, the Latins failed to induce all their Greek subjects to acknowledge the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In its best days the Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> never numbered more than twenty-two archbishoprics and fifty-nine suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, situated in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, in the islands, and even in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. However, the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople outlived the Latin Empire, after the fall of which the Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> resided in Greece or in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. From 1302 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> reserved to itself the appointment to this office and united with the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> first the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/03244d.htm">Candia</a>, later the Bishopric of Negropont; this was still the situation as late as 1463. A consistorial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1497 reserved this high title to <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>; the rule, however, was subject to many exceptions. In modern times a contrary practice has prevailed; the Latin titular <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople ceases to bear this title only on entrance to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. Of course, after the fall of the Latin or <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire in 1261, the Latin patriarch could not deal directly with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Constantinople; they were committed to the care of patriarchal vicars, simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> chosen usually among the superiors of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders resident in the city, Observantine or <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventual Franciscans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. This lasted until 1651, when the Latin patriarch was allowed by the sultan to have in Constantinople a patriarchal suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was free to administer the diocese in the name of the patriarch. Finally, in 1772, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> suppressed the office of patriarchal suffragan an appointed patriarchal <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, which system is yet in existence.
<h2>Restoration of Greek empire; efforts at reunion of the Churches</h2>

<p>Having anticipated a little we may here take up the thread of our narrative. By the recovery of Constantinople in 1261, Michael Pal&aelig;ologus had drawn on himself the enmity of some Western princes, especially of Charles of Anjou, brother of St. Louis and heir to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the aforesaid Latin emperors of Constantinople. To forestall the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> with which he was threatened, the Greek emperor opened negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and accepted the union of the Churches. It was proclaimed at the Ecumenical Council of Lyons in 1274, and was confirmed at Constantinople by several particular councils held under the Greek patriarch, <a href="../cathen/02380b.htm">John Beccus</a>, a sincere <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. It was not, however, accepted by the Greek people who remained always inimical to the West, and, on the emperor's death in 1282, it was rejected at a council held in the Blachern&aelig; church. Thenceforth the rulers of Constantinople had to reckon with the ambitious claims of Charles of Valois, brother of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, and of other Latin pretenders to the imperial crown. The city itself was remit by the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> disputes of Barlaamites and Palamists arising from <a href="../cathen/07301a.htm">Hesychasm</a>, also by the domestic dissensions of the imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> during the reigns of the two Andronici, John Pal&aelig;ologus, and John Cantacuzene. With the aid of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> mercenaries John Cantacuzene (the hope of the Palamists) withstood the legitimate emperor and conquered the city.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> was now in face of its last and greatest peril. The smaller Greek Empire of <a href="../cathen/15028a.htm">Trebizond</a> controlled since 1204 a part of its <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> provinces. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section4">Fourth Crusade</a> had caused almost all the islands and a great part of its possessions in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to fall into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>, <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, and local dynasts. It feared most, however, the new empire of the Osmanlis that was rapidly overflowing all <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. The Osmanlis were originally a small <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> tribe of Khorassan; in the thirteenth century they had settled near Doryl&aelig;um (Eski-Shehir), whence they gradually annexed all the sultanates and principalities of the Seljuk <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and others. As early as 1326 Brusa in Bithynia had become the centre of their power. A <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> fleet soon conveyed their army into <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, where they took <a href="../cathen/03183c.htm">Gallipoli</a> in 1397. Thenceforth, while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were especially anxious to save the Greek East and Constantinople, the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, excited by their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, appeared daily more hostile to the West and exhausted their opportunities in useless <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> disputes. The memorable defeat of the Serbs and <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> at Kossovo in 1389, and that of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> at Nicopolis in 1396, seemed to indicate the hopelessness of the Byzantine cause, when the Mongol invasion of Timur-Leng (Tamerlane) and the defeat of Sultan Bayazid at <a href="../cathen/01513a.htm">Angora</a> in 1402 combined to assure another half-century of existence to the doomed empire.

<p>Scarcely had Manuel II heard of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> disaster when he pulled down the mosque in his capital and abandoned his negotiations at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he had initiated proposals of peace, but only for political reasons. However, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> power had not been destroyed on the plain of <a href="../cathen/01513a.htm">Angora</a>. From June to September, 1422, Sultan Murad II laid siege to Constantinople, which he nearly captured. Though finally repulsed, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> tightened daily their control over all approaches to the city, which only a new <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> could have relieved. At the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, therefore (1439), the Greeks again declared themselves <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. This formal reunion, however, imposed by the emperor and again rejected by the Greek nation, could not in the beginning be proclaimed even at Constantinople, in spite of the election of a patriarch favourable to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and of Western promises to help the Greeks with men and money. Mark of <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> and after him <a href="../cathen/06416b.htm">Gennadius Scholarius</a> were <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> with <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, and infused into them fresh <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the Latins. Nevertheless, the promised <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> took place under the direction of Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini. <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">J&aacute;nos Hunyady</a> and Iskender-Beg (Scanderbeg) performed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of valour, but in vain. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> were completely defeated at Varna in 1444, and nothing was left to Constantinople but to perish honourably. The reunion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as accepted at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, was at last proclaimed officially in St. Sophia by Cardinal Isidore, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kiev (12 Dec., 1452). It was thus fated that <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> Dragases, the last heir of the great Constantine, was to die in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>.
<h2>Fall of Constantinople; capital of Ottoman Empire</h2>

<p>When the tragic hour struck, the emperor had only about 7000 men, including all foreign succour. Since March, 1453, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, to the number of 200,000, had invested the city; the preceding year they had built on the Bosporus the redoubtable fortress of Rumeli-Hissar. Their fleet also held the entrance to the Dardanelles, but was prevented from entering the Golden Horn by a strong iron chain that barred its mouth. But Mohammed II caused seventy of his ships to slide on greased planks behind Galata; in this way they entered the Golden Horn (22 April). He then cast across it a bridge of boats broad enough to allow the passage of five soldiers abreast, while his troops, constantly renewed, kept up without ceasing their attacks by land. Eventually the defenders were exhausted by the toils of a continuous and hopeless conflict, while their ranks grew steadily thinner through death or wounds. The population gave no help and was content to taunt the Latins, while waiting for the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle of Heaven</a> that was to save them. Finally, 29 May, 1453, about 4 o'clock in the morning, a furious assault of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> broke down the walls and gates of the city, and the besiegers burst in from every side. <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> fell like a hero at the gate of <a href="../cathen/13163a.htm">St.Romanus</a>. St. Sophia was immediately transformed into a mosque, and during three days the unhappy city was abandoned to unspeakable excesses of cruelty and debauchery. The next year, at the demand of the sultan himself, <a href="../cathen/06416b.htm">Gennadius Scholarius</a>, Rome's haughty adversary, was appointed <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, and soon the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> was reestablished, almost in its former position.

<p>Thus was granted the sacrilegious <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of so many Greeks, blinded by unreasoning hate, that henceforth, not the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>, but the turban should rule in the city of Constantine. Even the name of the city was changed. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> call it officially (in Arabic) Der-es-Saadet, Door of Happiness, or (chiefly on <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>) Konstantinieh. Their usual name for it is Stamboul, or rather Istamboul, a corruption of the Greek expression <em>eis ten polin</em> (pronounced <em>stimboli</em>), perhaps under the influence of a form, Islamboul, which could pass for "the city of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>". Most of the churches, like St. Sophia, were gradually converted into mosques. This was the fate of SS. Sergius and Bacchus &#151; a beautiful monument built by <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a>, commonly called "the little St. Sophia"; of the church of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Khora, whose splendid <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> and pictures, mostly of the fourteenth century, are among the principal curiosities of the city; of the churches of the celebrated Pantocrator and <a href="../cathen/14316c.htm">Studium</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, etc. Other churches were demolished and replaced by various buildings; thus the church of the Holy Apostles gave way to the great mosque built by the conquering Sultan Mohammed II. The imperial <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> in this church were violated; some of their gigantic red porphyry sarcophagi were taken to the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Irene. The latter is the only church taken from the Greeks that has not been changed into a mosque or demolished; it became, and is yet an arsenal, or rather a museum of ancient weapons.

<p>The sultans in turn endowed their new capital with many beautiful monuments. Mohammed II built the castle of Yedi-Kouleh, the Tchinili-Kiosk (now a museum), the mosques of Cheik Bokhari, of the Janizaries, of Kassim-Pasha, of Eyoub, where every sultan at his accession is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to be girt with the sword of Othman, etc. Bayazid II built the Bayazidieh (1458). Soliman the Magnificent built the Suleimanieh, the most beautiful <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> monument in Constantinople. His architect Sinan constructed fifty other mosques in the empire. Ahmed I built (1610) the Ahmedieh on the foundations of the imperial Great Palace, a pretty fountain near St. Sophia, etc. The buildings of the old seraglio at Seraglio Point are also of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> origin; nothing is left of the Byzantine imperial palaces that once stood there. The Blachern&aelig; palace has also disappeared; its church was accidentally burned in the seventeenth century. Not far distant are the important ruins of the palace of the Porphyrogenitus. When the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> took Constantinople, the hippodrome was already in ruinous decay. There remain yet three precious monuments of ancient imperial splendour: the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> obelisk brought thither by <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius the Great</a>, the Serpentine Column brought from Delphi by Constantine, and the Byzantine monument known as the Walled-up Column. Near them has been constructed, on the plans and at the expense of the German Emperor, William II, a fountain in Byzantine style. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> have also respected some other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of antiquity, especially the columns of Constantine, Marcian, <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>, and Arcadius, the aqueduct of <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>, and many of the great subterraneous cisterns.
<h2>The Turkish city</h2>

<p>This is not the place to narrate the later history of the city, so often the scene of sanguinary events, revolts of the Janizaries, palace-revolutions, etc. In 1826 Mahmud II suppressed the redoubtable pr&aelig;torians, but the tragic domestic revolutions go on as before. In 1807 a British fleet threatened the city, which was <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> defended by Sultan Selim III and the French ambassador, General Sebastiani. In 1854 Anglo-French armies encamped at Constantinople before and after the Crimean expedition against <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. In 1878 the Russians advanced to San Stefano, a little village in the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> suburbs, and dictated there the treaty of that name. In 1821 the Greek patriarch, Gregory V, with many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, was hanged on the occasion of the outbreak of the Greek War for Independence. In 1895-1896 the capital, as well as the provinces, saw many <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> massacred by the Kurds, with the complicity, or rather by order of the Government. Even the dreadful physical catastrophes of former times have been renewed; great conflagrations in 1864 and 1870 destroyed entire quarters at Stamboul and Pera. In the latter place many thousands of lives were lost (most of the houses are built of timber). In 1894 an earthquake laid low a great part of the Bazaar and killed several thousand <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The city is now undergoing a slow process of cleansing; it is lit by gas, and there are some tramways in its streets, most of which are still very narrow and dirty, and are at all times obstructed by vagrant dogs. A cable railway joins Galata to Pera.
<h2>National and religious statistics</h2>

<p>The population, we have already said, is (1908) at least 1,000,000, perhaps 1,200,000; <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> statistics are very uncertain. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> seem to form about three-fifths of this population. There are more than 2000 mosques, near which are generally found elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and even for girls; often also <em>medressehs</em> or <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <em>tekk&eacute;s</em> are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for dervishes of various orders. Superior instruction is given at the Lyceum of Galata Seraglio. It has about 1200 pupils (mostly <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>), and instruction is given in both <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> and French. Efforts are being made to transform this college into a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. There are also about 20 secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of law, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine, military <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and other professional and special <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> annexed to the great mosques contain precious Eastern <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. There are many <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, several of which are in charge of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Sisters of Charity, an asylum for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, a Pasteur institute, and other charitable foundations. The Persian <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, generally Shiites, have their own religious organization, with a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Stamboul, conducted by Sisters of Charity. The Jewish population increases rapidly, and is of two kinds: the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who came to Turkey in the sixteenth century when expelled from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and still speak a bad Spanish; others, who came and still come from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, etc. The latter often obtain good situations; not so the former, whose social status is low and unhappy. There is also among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the city a diversity of rites, <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and works of beneficence. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> seem to number over 300,000. If we except an insignificant body of <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> and their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the rest may be divided as <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, Orthodox Greeks, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> are <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, who call themselves Gregorians, after their apostle, <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory Illuminator</a>. They number about 100,000, with a patriarch resident at Koum-Kapou (Stamboul), many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 53 elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 colleges, a large charitable establishment at Y&eacute;di-Kouleh, etc.

<p><a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> is represented by English, American, German, and other foreign colonies, also by about one thousand <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> converts. Its chief institutions, apart from several churches, are the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> house at Stamboul with its branches (homes for sailors and foreign girls), Robert College at Rumeli-Hissar on the Bosporus (a large American <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> founded in 1863, with about 600 pupils), and a high school for girls at <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a>. There are also some elementary <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and a special mission for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, finally an English and a German <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. The Schismatic Greeks who call themselves Orthodox, number about 150,000, some thousands of whom are Hellenes, i.e. subjects of the Kingdom of Greece. The Ecumenical patriarch, who resides in the Fanar (Greek quarter, along the Golden Horn), is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (there are <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolites</a> at Kadi-Keui and at Makri-Keui, the latter with the title of Derki). He is aided in the administration of his office by the Great Protosyncellus. There are 40 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 12 of which are first class, 11 second class, and 17 third class. The principal churches prefer instead of a simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a>: they are five in number. Recent statistics show 72 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 64 of which give elementary and middle, and 8 superior teaching. Amon the higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are included the so-called Great National School in the Fanar (said to date from the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>), the commercial and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Halki, etc. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. These Greek <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> have 398 teachers and 13,217 pupils; the elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> have 10,665 pupils, and the superior <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> 2562. We may add that many Greek boys and girls, also <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, are taught in foreign <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, chiefly in those of the French religious congregations and at Robert College. The Greeks have a large charitable establishment at Balekli and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. Quite important also are their various associations (<em>syollogi</em>), the principal one being the important learned body known as the Literary Greek Society, with a rich <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of the Metochion, of the Holy Sepulchre, and the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Halki are also remarkable for their <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. For the general organization of the Greek Schismatics, see <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">GREEK CHURCH</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> have at Constantinople 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, and an arch&aelig;ological institute, with a rich <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. The Serbs and Rumanians have also their national establishments. There are in the capital about 15,000 <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>. They are considered schismatics by the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, from which they have completely separated. Their <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, who has <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all native <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> and those of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Turkey, resides at Chichli (pronounced <em>shishli</em>), where there are also a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>. His <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is at Balata, Stamboul.
<h2>Catholic life and statistics</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> include those of the Roman or <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, and others of Eastern rites often called Uniats. Among the latter, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> deserve most attention; they number about 5000. Their patriarch resides at Pera, and to their special organization belong: 6 elementary and 3 middle <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, also a large charitable establishment for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and for poor or sick people. They have four congregations conducted as follows: The <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> have 2 residences, 19 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1 residence, 8 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; the Antonines, 1 residence, 8 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, 3 residences, about 100 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> or Arabic-speaking Syrians of <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Rite</a> have a church with 3 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, one of whom acts as vicar of his patriarch for all affairs of the "nation" that come before the Sublime Porte. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of the Chaldeans and the Syrians are similarly represented by vicars to whom are subject the few faithful of their rites present in the city. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Greeks, few in number as yet, are subject to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a>; they have two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, at Koum-Kapou (Stamboul) and Kadi-Keui, conducted by the <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>, and a mission at Pera, conducted by the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>. The former have also missions for the Greeks at C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia and at Peramos in the Peninsula of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>; the latter at Malgara and Daoudili in Thrace. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> have at Galata their <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Georgians are few and are subject to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a>; most of them belong to the Latin or the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Rite.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>, as already stated, are ruled by an Apostolic vicar. Though a titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> he enjoys ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and since 1868 is <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a>. He resides at Pancaldi and has there his procathedral. His authority is not acknowledged by the Sublime Porte and he is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to use the French embassy in his relations with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Government. The limits of his vicariate are: in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the Vicariate of Sofia, the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of Uscub and Durazzo, and the Apostolic Delegation of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>; in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14739a.htm">Diocese of Tiraspol</a>, the Apostolic Delegations of Mesopotamia and Aleppo, and the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>. The Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> subject to him must number (1908) between 30,000 and 35,000, about 22,000 of whom are at Constantinople. Other principal centres are, in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>: <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Salonica</a>, <a href="../cathen/03183c.htm">Gallipoli</a>, Cavalla, Monastir, Rodosto, Dede-Aghatch, and Adrianople, with about 6000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>: Brusa, Ismid, Adampol, Zongoul-Dagh, Dardanelles, Eski-Shehir, <a href="../cathen/01513a.htm">Angora</a>, <a href="../cathen/15028a.htm">Trebizond</a>, Samsoun, and Erzeroum with about 3000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Most Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are of foreign nationalities and come from <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, etc.

<p>Almost all the religious works of the Apostolic vicariate are conducted by <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders or congregations. The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> counts only about ten members; they possess the two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Pancaldi (pro-cathedral) and the Dardanelles. There are fourteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (five principal) in Constantinople and its suburbs. Outside the capital, the vicariate comprises 7 other <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 23 missionary stations. There are several <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, but none for the vicariate itself: a Greek preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Koum-Kapou (Stamboul), a <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Kara-Aghatch (<a href="../cathen/01161a.htm">Adrianople</a>), a <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek</a>-<a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Kadi-Keui, conducted by the <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>, with respectively 30, 35, and 10 pupils; the Eastern Seminary, preparatory and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, founded at Pera in 1889 by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> for Latin and Eastern Rite pupils of every Eastern diocese, with 45 to 50 pupils; the preparatory Seraphic Seminary conducted since 1894 at San Stefano by Austrian <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, 30 pupils; a <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> preparatory and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Zeitenlik (Salonica), conducted by the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, 58 pupils. Eighty elementary or middle <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are conducted by the aforesaid religious congregations. There are 74 primary and boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, for boys or girls, with 11,400 pupils (7030 girls and 4370 boys), 6 (properly so called) colleges for boys with 1410 pupils and a commercial institute. Moreover, 600 male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> are trained in 6 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>. A professional <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has just been founded. More than half of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are situated in Constantinople or its suburbs. Many of the pupils are not <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and many are <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. There is at Feri-Keui a large and beautiful cemetery.
