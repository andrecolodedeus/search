<h1>Constitutio Romanos Pontifices</h1>  

<p>The restoration by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 29 Sept. 1850, by letters Apostolic "Universalis ecclesi&aelig;" of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and the consequent transition to the new order of things, necessarily gave rise to misunderstandings and discussion in various matters of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and discipline, particularly between the episcopate and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Bishops, as was incumbent upon them, strenuously maintained the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, while religious superiors were loath to surrender prerogatives previously exercised. The chief points of controversy related to the exemption of regulars from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; the right of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to divide <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or missions conducted by regulars, and to place <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> in charge of these newly-created missions; the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of regulars engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work to attend conferences of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>; the force of their appeal from synodal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>; their liberty to found new houses, colleges and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, or to convert existing institutions to other purposes; the right of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to visit canonically institutions in charge of regulars; and certain financial matters. Individual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sought to cope with the situation until finally a proposition of <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a>, made in an annual meeting of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1877, to submit these difficulties to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for definite settlement, met with unanimous approval. In July, 1878, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> formally associated themselves with their English brethren in the controversy. Negotiations were opened with <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, but <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> later suggested to <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> the appointment of a special commission to examine the claims of the contestants and to prepare a constitution. Repeated delays ensued, so that it was not until 20 Sept., 1880, that a special commission of nine <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> chosen to consider the question had its first sitting. Four other sessions followed, and in Jan., 1881, a report was made to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Finally the constitution "Romanos Pontifices", of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> was issued 8 May of the same year, defining the relations in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and religious. This constitution has been extended to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (25 Sept., 1885), to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (14 March, 1911), to South America (1 Jan., 1900), to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a> (1 Jan., 1910), and quite generally to missionary countries. The provisions of the "Romanos Pontifices" may be grouped into three heads: <ul> <li>the exemption of religious from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; <li>relations to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of religious engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>; <li>and matters pertaining to temporal goods. </ul> The constitution makes clear the following: though regulars according to canon law are subject immediately to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are given <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over small communities. The constitution "Romanos Pontifices" makes a further concession exempting regulars as such, living in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residences in small numbers or even alone, almost entirely from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ordinary. "We hesitate not to declare", it states, "that regulars dwelling in their own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, are exempt from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ordinary, except in cases expressly mentioned in law, and generally speaking in matters pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> and the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>."

<p>In <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> ministrations, then, regulars are subject in all things to episcopal supervision, visitation, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and correction. If engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work, religious are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to assist at conferences of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as well as at <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. "We declare," says the constitution, "that all rectors of missions are bound by their office to attend the conferences of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; and moreover we ordain and command that vicars also and other religious enjoying ordinary missionary faculties, living in residences and small missions, do the same." The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> prescribes that all having the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> be present at <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. The constitution says in regard to this question: Let the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> be observed. Another point of controversy related to appeals from synodal decrees. Regulars are not denied this right. Their appeal from the ordinary's interpretation of synodal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> in matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> has a devolutive effect only; in matters pertaining to regulars as such, owing to their exemption, an appeal begets a suspensive effect. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> right to divide <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, even though under the management of regulars, is maintained, providing the formalities prescribed in law be observed. The opinion of the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the mission to be divided must be sought; while a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not free to divide a mission in charge of religious without consulting their superior. An appeal, devolutive in character, to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, should the case require it, is granted from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> decision to divide a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> or mission. The ordinary is free to follow his own judgment in appointing rectors of new missions, even when formed from <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in charge of regulars. The claim of regulars to preference in these appointments is thus denied. It is unlawful for religious to establish new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, colleges, or <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> without the previous consent of the ordinary and of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. Similar permission is required to convert existing institutions to other purposes, except where such change, affecting merely the domestic arrangements or discipline of regulars themselves, is not contrary to the conditions of the foundation. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may exercise the right of <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> in regard to churches and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> or elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, though they be in charge of regulars. This right does not extend to cemeteries or institutions for the use of religious only; nor to colleges in which religious, according to their rule, devote themselves to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth. The temporal affairs of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> or mission are determined by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, published 19 April, 1969. All goods given to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or missions must be accounted for according to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>; not, however, donations made to regulars for themselves. It is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the ordinary to see that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> goods are devoted to the purposes designated by the donors. Inventories (<a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, 10 May, 1867) will distinguish <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> belongings from those of regulars. These regulations of former decrees are embodied in "Romanos Pontifices."
