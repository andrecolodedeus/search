<h1>Continence</h1>  

<p>Continence may be defined as abstinence from even the licit gratifications of marriage. It is a form of the virtue of temperance, though <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> did not accord it this high character since it involved a conflict with wrong desires--an element, in the mind of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, foreign to the content of a virtue in the strict sense. Continence, it is seen, has a more restricted significance than chastity, since the latter finds place in the condition of marriage. The abstinence we are discussing, then, belongs to the state of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, though clearly the notion of this latter does not necessarily involve that of continence.
<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>In considering its practice we regard continence as a state of life. Though among savages and barbarians every one, as a rule, seeks to contract an early marriage, yet even among these peoples continence is frequently practiced by those who discharge the public <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of religion. Thus according to authorities cited by Westmarck, the male wizards of <a href="../cathen/11540a.htm">Patagonia</a> embraced a life of continence, as did the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Mosquito Islands and of ancient Mexico. According to Chinese law such condition of abstinence is made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> upon all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> or Taoist. Among the Greeks continence was required of several orders of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and priestesses, as it was of the vestals among the Romans. The continence extensively observed among the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, and some of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, though not confined to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> class, was reckoned the means to a greater sanctification. Such widespread practice offers evidence of an instinctive feeling that the indulgence of our sensual nature is in a measure degrading, and that it is particularly incompatible with the perfect purity that should characterize one <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the worship of the All Holy. That the attitude of a number of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> towards the lower side of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has taken on a character of unreasonable, and even absurd, severity is clear. This is observed especially in the case of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> and branches of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> in the past and of the Shakers and other unimportant communities in our time. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> imposing a state of continence upon its <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and upon its <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is set forth in the articles <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">CELIBACY OF THE CLERGY</a>; <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">RELIGIOUS LIFE</a>; and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">VIRGINITY</a>.

<p>Two general objections are frequently urged against the state of continence. First, it is said that the condition of continence is detrimental to the well-being of the individual. In such a statement, it will be frequently found, continence is understood as an unchaste <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, and such surely is not only a moral but a physical <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> most pernicious. Certain it is, however, that the self-sacrifice and control involved in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> continence finds fruitage in a greater measure of moral power. The words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs12">Matthew 19:12</a>) may be here appealed to. Moreover, the abstinence of which we speak is a condition of increased physical vigor and energy. Of this many savages are not unmindful; for among a number of these continence is imposed upon the braves during times of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> as a means of fostering and strengthening their daring and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. A second objection rests upon considerations of the social good. It is contended that a state of continence means failure to discharge the social <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of conserving the species. But such an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> falls, not upon every member of the community, but upon <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> at large, and is amply discharged though there be individual exceptions. Indeed the non-fulfillment of this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is never threatened by a too general observance of sexual abstinence. On the contrary it is only the unlawful gratification of carnal passion that can menace the due growth of population. But it may be said that the practice of continence withdraws form the function of reproduction the worthier members of society-those whose possible offspring would be the most desirable citizens of the State. This contention, however, overlooks the social service of the example set by such observance-a service which, in view of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> incumbent upon every individual of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of observing absolute chastity for periods of greater or less duration, is of highest value.
