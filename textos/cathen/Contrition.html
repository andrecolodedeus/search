<h1>Contrition</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>contritio</em>--a breaking of something hardened).

<p>In <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> nothing is more common than exhortations to repentance: "I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live" (<a href="../bible/eze033.htm#vrs11">Ezekiel 33:11</a>); "Except you do penance you shall all likewise perish" (<a href="../bible/luk013.htm#vrs5">Luke 13:5</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs41">Matthew 12:41</a>). At times this repentance includes exterior acts of satisfaction (<a href="../bible/psa006.htm#vrs7">Psalm 6:7 sqq.</a>); it always implies a recognition of wrong done to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a detestation of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> wrought, and a desire to turn from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and do good. This is clearly expressed in <a href="../bible/psa050.htm#vrs5">Psalm 50 (5-14)</a>: "For I know my iniquity . . . To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee . . . Turn away thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me", etc. More clearly does this appear in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#vrs13">Luke 18:13</a>), and more clearly still in the story of the prodigal (<a href="../bible/luk015.htm#vrs11">Luke 15:11-32</a>): "Father, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and before thee: I am not worthy to be called thy son".
<h2>Nature of contrition</h2>

<p>This interior repentance has been called by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> "contrition". It is defined explicitly by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XIV, ch. iv de Contritione): "a sorrow of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed, with a firm purpose of not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> in the future". The word <em>contrition</em> itself in a moral sense is not of frequent occurrence in Scripture (cf. <a href="../bible/psa050.htm#vrs19">Psalm 50:19</a>). Etymologically it implies a breaking of something that has become hardened. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> in his Commentary on the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> thus explains its peculiar use: "Since it is requisite for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that a man cast away entirely the liking for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which implies a sort of continuity and solidity in his mind, the act which obtains forgiveness is termed by a figure of speech 'contrition'" (In Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xvii; cf. Supplem. III, Q. i, a. 1). This sorrow of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not merely speculative sorrow for wrong done, remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, or a resolve to amend; it is a real pain and bitterness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> together with a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and horror for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed; and this <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> leads to the resolve to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more. The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">early Christian writers</a> in speaking of the nature of contrition sometimes insist on the feeling of sorrow, sometimes on the detestation of the wrong committed (Augustine in P.L., XXXVII, 1901, 1902; <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, P.G., XLVII, 409, 410). Augustine includes both when writing: "Compunctus corde non solet dici nisi stimulus peccatorum in dolore p&oelig;nitendi" (P.L., Vol. VI of Augustine, col. 1440). Nearly all the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> hold that contrition is based principally on the detestation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This detestation presupposes a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the heinousness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> begets sorrow and pain of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. "A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed by the consent, so it is blotted out by the dissent of the rational will; hence contrition is essentially sorrow. But it should be noted that <em>sorrow</em> has a twofold signification--dissent of the will and the consequent feeling; the former is of the essence of contrition, the latter is its effect" (Bonaventure, In Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xvi, Pt. I, art. 1). [See also <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, Comment. in Lib. Sent. IV; Billuart (De Sac. P&oelig;nit., Diss. iv, art. 1) seems to hold the opposite opinion.]
<h2>Necessity of contrition</h2>

<p>Until the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> no <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> ever thought of denying the necessity of contrition for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But with the coming of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone the absolute necessity of contrition was excluded as by a natural consequence. <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in the famous <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exsurge" [<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, no. 751 (635)] condemned the following <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> position: "By no means believe that you are forgiven on account of your contrition, but because of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words, 'Whatsoever thou shalt loose', etc. On this account I say, that if you receive the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, believe firmly that you are absolved, and truly absolved you will be, let the contrition be as it may." <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> could not deny that in every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion there was grief of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but he asserted that this was the result of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> poured into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at the time of justification, etc. (for this discussion see Vacant, Dict. de th&eacute;ol. cath., s.v. Contrition.) <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers have always taught the necessity of contrition for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and they have insisted that such necessity arises (a) from the very nature of repentance as well as (b) from the positive command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. (a) 'They point out that the sentence of Christ in <a href="../bible/luk013.htm#vrs5">Luke 13:5</a>, is final: "Except you do penance", etc., and from the Fathers they cite passages such as the following from <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="../fathers/050703.htm"><em>De Lapsis</em> 32</a>: "Do penance in full, give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the sorrow that comes from a grieving and lamenting <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> . . . they who do away with repentance for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, close the door to satisfaction." <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> laid down the satisfaction' principle, "No one can begin a new life who does not repent him of the old" (Bonaventure, In Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xvi, Pt. II, art. 1, Q. ii, also ex professo, ibid., Pt. I, art. I, Q. iii), and when asked the reason why, they point out the absolute incongruity of turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and clinging to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is hostile to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, mindful of the tradition of the ages, defined (Sess. XIV. ch. iv de Contritione) that "contrition has always been <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for obtaining forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>". (b) The positive command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is also clear in the premises. The <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Baptist</a> sounded the note of preparation for the coming of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>: "Make straight his paths"; and, as a consequence "they went out to him and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>". The first preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is described in the words: "Do penance, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand"; and the Apostles, in their first sermons to the people, warn them to "do penance and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs38">Acts 2:38</a>). The Fathers followed up with like exhortation (Clement in P.G., I, 341; Hermas iii P.G., II, 894; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> in P.L., II).


<h2>Perfect and imperfect contrition</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> distinguishes a twofold <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; one, perfect contrition, rises from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who has been grievously offended; the other, imperfect contrition, arises principally from some other motives, such as loss of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, fear of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, the heinousness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, etc. (Council of Trent, Sess. XIV, ch. iv de Contritione). For the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of imperfect contrition see <a href="../cathen/02065a.htm">ATTRITION</a>.
<h2>Qualities</h2>

<p>In accord with <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> contrition, whether it be perfect or imperfect, must be at once (a) interior, (b) <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, (c) universal, and (d) sovereign.
<h3 id="A">Interior</h3>

<p>Contrition must be real and sincere sorrow of heart, and not merely an external manifestation of repentance. The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Prophets laid particular stress on the necessity of hearty repentance. The Psalmist says that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> despises not the "contrite heart" (Ps. I, 19), and the call to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was, "Be converted to me with all your heart . . . and rend your hearts, and not your garments" (Joel, ii, 12 sq). Holy Job did penance in sackcloth and ashes because he reprehended himself in sorrow of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="../bible/job013.htm#vrs6">Job 13:6</a>). The contrition adjudged <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by Chris and his Apostles was no mere formality, but the sincere expression of the sorrowing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="../bible/luk014.htm#vrs11">Luke 14:11-32</a>; <a href="../bible/luk018.htm#vrs13">Luke 18:13</a>); and the grief of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the house of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> merited forgiveness because "she <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> much". The exhortations to penance found everywhere in the Fathers have no uncertain sound (<a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="../fathers/050703.htm"><em>De Lapsis</em></a>; <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, De compunctione, P.G., XLVII, 393 sqq.), and the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> from <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> on insist on the same sincerity in repentance (<a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xvi, no. 1).
<h3 id="B">Supernatural</h3>

<p>In accordance with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> contrition ought to be prompted by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">God's grace</a> and aroused by motives which spring from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as opposed to merely natural motives, such as loss of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, fortune, and the like (Chemnitz, Exam. Concil. Trid., Pt. II, De Poenit.). In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who gives a "new heart" and who puts a "new spirit)" into the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/eze036.htm#vrs25">Ezekiel 36:25-29</a>); and for a clean heart the Psalmist <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> in the Miserere (<a href="../bible/psa001.htm#vrs11">Psalm 1:11 sqq.</a>). St. Peter told those to whom he preached in the first days after Pentecost that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> had raised up Christ "to give repentance to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>" (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#vrs30">Acts 5:30 sq.</a>). <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in advising Timothy insists on dealing gently and kindly with those who resist the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, "if peradventure <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may give them full repentance" (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#vrs24">2 Timothy 2:24-25</a>). In the days of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian heresy</a> Augustine insisted on the supernaturalness of contrition, when he writes, "That we turn away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is our doing, and this is the bad will; but to turn back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we are unable unless He arouse and help us, and this is the good will." Some of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, notably <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, Cajetan, and after them Francisco Su&aacute;rez (De Poenit., Disp. iii, sect. vi), asked speculatively whether man if left to himself could elicit a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> act of contrition, but no <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> ever taught that makes for forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the present economy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could be inspired by merely natural motives. On the contrary, all the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> have insisted on the absolute necessity of grace for contrition that disposes to forgiveness (Bonaventure, In Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xiv, Pt. I, art. II, Q. iii; also dist. xvii, Pt. I, art. I, Q. iii; cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, In Lib. Sent. IV). In keeping with this teaching of the Scriptures and the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> defined; "If anyone say that without the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and without His aid a man can repent in the way that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for obtaining the grace of justification, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>."
<h3 id="C">Universal</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that real contrition includes "a firm purpose of not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> in the future"; consequently he who repents must resolve to avoid all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is intimately bound up with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> concerning grace and repentance. There is no forgiveness without sorrow of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and forgiveness is always accompanied by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">God's grace</a>; grace cannot coexist with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and, as a consequence, one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be forgiven while another remains for which their is no repentance. This is the clear teaching of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. The Prophet urged men to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with their whole heart (Joel, ii, 12 sq.), and Christ tells the doctor of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that we must <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with our whole mind, our whole strength (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs27">Luke 10:27</a>). Ezechiel insists that a man must "turn from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways" if he wish to live. The <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> inquired rather subtly into this question when they asked whether or not there must be a special act of contrition for every serious <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and whether, in order to be forgiven, one must remember at the moment all grievous transgressions. To both questions they answered in the negative, judging that an act of sorrow which implicitly included all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> would be sufficient.
<h3 id="D">Sovereign</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> insists that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> contrition includes the firm will never to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> again, so that no mater what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may come, such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> must be preferred to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is surely <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>: "What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?" <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> have discussed at great length whether or not contrition which must be sovereign <em>appretiative</em>, i.e., in regarding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as the greatest possible <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, must also be sovereign in degree and in intensity. The decision has generally been that sorrow need not be sovereign "intensively", for intensity makes no change in the substance of an act (Ballerini, Opus Morale: De Contritione; Bonaventure, In Lib. Sent. IV, dist. xxi, Pt. I, art. II, Q. i).
<h2>Contrition in the Sacrament of Penance</h2>

<p>Contrition is not only a moral virtue, but the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that it is a "part", nay more, <em>quasi materia</em>, in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. "The (quasi) matter of this sacrament consists of the acts of the penitent himself, namely, contrition, confession, and satisfaction. These, inasmuch as they are by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> institution required in the penitent for the integrity of the sacrament and for the full and perfect remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are for this reason called parts of penance. "In consequence of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of Trent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> teach that sorrow for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must be in some sense sacramental. La Croix went so far as to say that sorrow must be aroused with a view of going to confession, but this seems to be asking too much; most <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> think with Schieler-Heuser (Theory and Practice of Confession, p. 113) that it is sufficient if the sorrow coexist in any way with the confession and is referred to it. Hence the precept of the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, "After the confessor has heard the confession he should try by earnest exhortation to move the penitent to contrition" (Schieler-Heuser, op. cit., p. 111 sqq.).
<h2>Perfect contrition without the sacrament</h2>

<p>Regarding that contrition which has for its motive the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declares: "The Council further teaches that, though contrition may sometimes be made perfect by charity and may reconcile men to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before the actual reception of this sacrament, still the reconciliation is not to be ascribed to the contrition apart from the desire for the sacrament which it includes." The following proposition (no. 32) taken from <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> was condemned by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>: "That charity which is the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not always conjoined with forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." Perfect contrition, with the desire of receiving the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, restores the sinner to grace at once. This is certainly the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> (<a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> in P.L., CXCII, 885; <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, In Lib. Sent. IV, ibid.; <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, In Lib. Sent. IV, ibid.). This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> they derived from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Scripture certainly ascribes to charity and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the power to take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: "He that loveth me shall be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by My Father"; "Many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven her because she hath <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> much". Since the act of perfect contrition implies necessarily this same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have ascribed to perfect contrition what Scripture teaches belongs to charity. Nor is this strange, for in the Old Covenant there was some way of recovering <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> grace once man had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live (<a href="../bible/eze033.htm#vrs11">Ezekiel 33:11</a>). This total turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> corresponds to our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of perfect contrition; and if under the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> sufficed for the pardon of the sinner, surely the coming of Christ and the institution of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> cannot be supposed to have increased the difficulty of obtaining forgiveness. That the earlier Fathers taught the efficacy of sorrow for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is very clear (Clement in P.G., I, 341 sqq.; and Hermas in P.G., II, 894 sqq.; <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> in P.G., XLIX, 285 sqq.) and this is particularly noticeable in all the commentaries on <a href="../bible/luk007.htm">Luke 7:47</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> writes (P.L., XCII, 425): "What is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> but fire; what is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but rust? Hence it is said, many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven her because she hat <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> much, as though to say, she hath burned away entirely the rust of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because she is inflamed with the fire of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>." <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> have inquired with much learning as to the kind of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that justifies with the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. All are agreed that pure, or disinterested, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<em>amor benevolenti&aelig;, amor amiciti&aelig;</em>) suffices; when there is question of interested, or selfish, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<em>amor concupiscentia</em>) <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> hold that purely selfish <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is not sufficient. When on furthermore asks what must be the formal motive in perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, there seems to be no real unanimity among the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>. Some say that where there is perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> for His great <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> alone; other, basing their contention on Scripture, think that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of gratitude (<em>amor gratitudinis</em>) is quite sufficient, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> benevolence and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards men are intimately united, nay, inseparable from His Divine perfections (<a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, Theol. Dog., Thesis ccxlv, Scholion iii, no 3; Schieler-Heuser, op. cit., pp. 77 sq.).
<h2>Obligation of eliciting the act of contrition</h2>

<p>In the very nature of things the sinner must repent before he can be reconciled with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Sess. XIV, ch. iv, de Contritione, <em>Fuit quovis tempore</em>, etc.). Therefore he who has fallen into grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> must either make an act of perfect contrition or supplement the imperfect contrition by receiving the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>; otherwise reconciliation with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is impossible. This <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> urges under pain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when there is danger of death. In danger of death, therefore, if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be not at hand to administer the sacrament, the sinner must make an effort to elicit an act of perfect contrition. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of perfect contrition is also urgent whensoever one has to exercise some act for which a state of grace is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> is not accessible. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> have questions how long a man may remain in the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, without making an effort to elicit an act of perfect contrition. They seem agreed that such neglect must have extended over considerable time, but what constitutes a considerable time they find it hard to determine (Schieler-Hauser, op. cit., pp. 83 sqq.). Probably the rule of <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a> will aid the solution: "The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of making an act of contrition is urgent when one is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make an act of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>" (Sabetti, Theologia Moralis: de necess. contritionis, no. 731; Ballerine, Opus Morale: de contritione).
