<h1>Convent Schools (Great Britain)</h1>  

<p>Convent <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is treated here not historically but as it is at the present day, and, by the way of introduction, it may be briefly stated that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of including the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young amongst the occupations of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community is practically as old as that of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> itself. From the earliest times it was customary in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for children to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who went forth from <a href="../cathen/15648a.htm">Wimborne</a> in the eighth century to help <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> in his work of evangelizing Saxony, established <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> wherever they went, in which a very high standard of scholarship was attained. Stray remarks in <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucer</a> and other <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers likewise reveal the fact that the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> compared favourably with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the other sex. But all this came to an end at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, so far as <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was concerned; and, save for one notable exception, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> had practically to start afresh in the nineteenth century. The exception referred to was the bar Convent at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/08054a.htm">Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, whose foundress, <a href="../cathen/15551c.htm">Mary Ward</a>, was the pioneer of religious congregations devoted to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of English girls. The bar Convent was established in 1686, and in spite of <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, no-popery riots, and even, on more than one occasion, the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> for their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the work of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> has continued from that day to this, and with its hundred and eighty houses in different parts of the English-speaking world, the Institute of the B. V. M. has long held a foremost place amongst the teaching orders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The opening of numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> during the latter half of the nineteenth century has produced correspondingly numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, in many of which, be it noted, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> girls (especially in day and elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>) have been and are still being <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>. The foundation of training colleges for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers, the demand for teachers with academic qualifications, the move in favour of Government inspection with the consequent official recognition of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and the more recent advance in the way of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, have all combined to raise the standard of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; and the leading teaching orders have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> equal to the demand made upon their capabilities and energy. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> stand foremost in the work they have done for religion and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and they have turned out hundreds of girls, not only <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the highest sense of the word but also truly religious.

<p>Although in its widest sense the term "Convent Schools" may be taken to include all those, of whatever kind, in which the work of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is undertaken by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> religious - such as primary or elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (whether mixed or for girls only), reformatory and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> - it is only proposed in this article to deal with secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, i.e. day or boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the upper and middle classes, training colleges for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schoolmistresses, and colleges for the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, these being more closely connected with <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> life itself.
<h2>Secondary education</h2>

<p>Almost all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are under Government inspection. This gives them the status of being "recognized" by the Board of Education, regulates their course of studies, and ensures unity of method and efficiency. Some are also in receipt of a State aid-grant, which places certain restrictions upon their methods of management. Where no grant is accepted the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> are more independent as regards the admission and refusal of pupils. The aim of all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders engaged in secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for girls is, whilst making every effort to keep abreast of modern requirements with regard to scholastic efficiency, to give also the additional advantage of a thorough religious training, so that <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> may have no reason to fear that by securing the latter for their children they are sacrificing the greater temporal advantages that might be obtained at a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The system of Government inspection and recognition by the Board of Education, with or without the State aid-grant, secures the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> degree of efficiency, whilst he general character and reputation of the various communities by which the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are conducted sufficiently guarantees the religious side of their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work. Government inspectors and public examiners have frequently testified to the excellent moral tone and atmosphere of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and to the cordial relations existing between teachers and pupils, no less than to the high teaching ability of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> themselves. The fact that <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in its truest sense means something more than mere book-learning is nowhere more fully realized than in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and results all tend to prove that the religious and moral training imparted in such establishments has in no way acted as a hindrance to the more technical side of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work. It has sometimes been said that the standard of scholarship attained is not so high in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> as in non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the same class, but however <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> this may have been in the past, the general levelling up that has taken place during the last ten or twenty years has rendered the reproach an idle one now. The public examination lists of recent years afford ample <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the leading <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are equal in efficiency to all others.



<p>The range of studies pursued in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is a wide one. It includes religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, English in all its branches, French, Latin, mathematics, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, drawing, <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">needlework</a>, class-singing, and drilling, while such subjects as music, singing, dancing, Greek, German, Italian, elocution, shorthand, book-keeping, dressmaking, cooking, etc., are generally taught as optional extras. Pupils are entered for the Oxford and Cambridge Local Examinations, the Higher Locals, the Higher and Lower Certificates of the Oxford and Cambridge Joint Examination Board, the Matriculation Examinations of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and Liverpool Universities, as well as for those of the College of Preceptors, the Incorporated Society of Musicians, the Royal academy of Music, and the South Kensington School of Art. School buildings and accommodations are of the most up-to-date pattern - one of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conditions for Government recognition. Physical development is provided for by means of hockey, croquet, tennis, cycling, swimming, and gymnastics, according to the particular circumstances of each <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.

<p>All the leading <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> communities make a special point of having their teachers properly trained and fully qualified. This again is a sine qu&acirc; non for official recognition, and the Order in Council of 1902, concerning the registration of secondary teachers, gave fresh impetus to the work of training teachers for <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The principal teaching orders send their subjects usually to one or other of the two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> training colleges for secondary teachers (St. Mary's Hall, <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, and Cavendish Squar e, London), or else have them qualify by obtaining one or more of the following: the teaching diploma of the Cambridge Teachers' Training Syndicate, the Oxford diploma for teachers, Women's Honours in Modern Languages (Oxford), the Women's diploma for the Oxford <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B. A. degree</a>, the LL. A. diploma of St. Andrew's University, the Licentiateship of the College of Preceptors, the Higher Certificate of the Oxford and Cambridge Joint Board, the Higher Local Certificate of Oxford or Cambridge, or a degree at one of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> that grant degrees to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, or Dublin. Foreign languages are in most cases taught by natives, and in the teaching of many of the special subjects the religious are assisted by extern professors holding the highest qualifications. From these few facts it will be evident that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> are adequately keeping pace with the times and that in point of efficiency they are in no way behind non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the same class, while the facilities that have been recently brought into existence for the advanced <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, religious as well as secular, at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge point to a still higher degree of efficiency for the future.

<p>There are at the present over two hundred <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> under the care of representatives of about sixty different <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Chief among these may be mentioned the English Institute of the B. V. M., with six such <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus (eight <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>), the Faithful Companions of Jesus (fourteen), the Sisters of Notre Dame of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a> (eighteen), the Religious of St. Andrew (One), the Religious of the Sacred Heart (eight), the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> (eleven), the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> (three), and the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> of different congregations (twenty-three). Some of the best known and most successful of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are those at York and Cambridge (Inst. Of B. V. M.); Mayfield, St. Leonard's, Preston, Harrogate, and Cavendish Square, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus); Isleworth, <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, Birkenhead, and Clarendon Square, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (Faithful Companions); Liverpool (Mount Pleasant), <a href="../cathen/11107b.htm">Northampton</a>, and Norwich (Notre Dame); Streatham (St. Andrew's); Stamford Hill (Servites); and <a href="../cathen/15225d.htm">St. Ursula's</a>, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>. Many of these secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> have attached to them pupil teachers' centres, where valuable preliminary work in the training of elementary schoolmistresses is done, and many of them serve also as "practising <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>" in which the students of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and other training colleges give their model lessons in the presence of their instructors and the Government inspectors. The pass and honours lists of the various public examinations in recent years show a very high percentage of candidates from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and prove conclusively that as far as results go they are fully equal to the best secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> under non-Catholic management.
<h2>Training colleges</h2>

<p>The training colleges are of two kinds - those for the training of primary or elementary schoolmistresses, and those for teachers in secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Both kinds are under the care of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. All the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> training colleges are recognized by government, and in those for primary teachers the students whose expenses are assisted by a Government grant are known as "King's Scholars", their selection as such being dependent upon a competitive examination under Government auspices. There are six recognized training colleges for primary teachers, Mount Pleasant, Liverpool (under the Sisters of Notre Dame); St. Charles' Square, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and Newcastle-on-Tyne (Religious of the Sacred Heart); Southampton (Nuns of La Sainte Union); Salford (Faithful Companions); and Hull (<a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>). In all of these the Government syllabus is followed and the Board of Education certificate is granted after two years' successful teaching in one <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, subsequent to the completion of the course at the college. An important part of the training consists in the "criticism lessons", which are given by the students in some secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> connected with the training college under the direction of the "Mistress of Method", and which are criticized then and there by her as well as by the other students in turn. The best known and largest of these training colleges, which was also the first to be established, is that of Mount Pleasant, <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, under the Sisters of Notre Dame of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>. It was opened in 1856 with twenty-one students and now numbers one hundred and sixty King's Scholars. It has been (1905) officially affiliated to the Liverpool University and a limited number of its students are allowed to follow the arts or <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> degree course of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> after the usual two years' Government course has been completed. The whole of the preliminary and certain subjects of the intermediate course can be done at Mount Pleasant under the sisters, which reduces the time of residence required for obtaining the degree. Although this is quite an innovation, it speaks well for the college that five out of the first six sent in obtained the <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B. A. degree</a> in the minimum period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<p>The training colleges for secondary teachers are St. Mary's Hall, <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, attached to Notre Dame, Mount Pleasant, and established in 1898; and Cavendish Square, London, under the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus, opened in 1895. Both of these are recognized by the Board of Education as well as by the Teachers' Syndicate of the <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge University</a>; and the teachers' diploma of that <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for "registration", is granted to successful students at the end of the course. Many of the other teaching orders send their subjects to these colleges, where while following the usual course with other students, special arrangements are made for them to carry out the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of their <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and to follow their own rule as far as possible. The theoretical studies include history and methods of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, ethics, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> management, and hygiene, tested by a written examination; and the practical work, taken in the secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> attached to the two colleges, is awarded the diploma after one year's practice and a test lesson given before a Government inspector. The syllabus of the Cambridge Syndicate is followed in all subjects except philosophy, for which a course of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> philosophy is allowed to be substituted.

<p>Hitherto only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> students have been admitted to these colleges, but regulations issued by the Board of Education (which came into force September 1908) require that no qualified student applying for admission may be rejected, if there is room, on the score of religion. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> have protested against this and memorialized the prime minster, but the authorities adhere to their decision and rule that no training college failing to comply with these regulations will in future be recognized. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> training colleges had therefore to face the alternative of the introduction of non-Catholic students to the exclusion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, where numbers are limited, or serious monetary loss through the withdrawal of the State-aided King's Scholars.
<h2>Higher education for women</h2>

<p>The higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, in connection with <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, is hardly out of the experimental stage. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> class in the Notre Dame Training College and its affiliation to the Liverpool University have already been mentioned. Up to 1895 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were prohibited (by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority) from entering the older residential <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Oxford and Cambridge, and the removal in that year of the prohibition favoured men only. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> had to wait still longer; but this restriction was taken away in June 1907, by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which sanctions under certain condition the opening of houses for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, both secular and religious, at Oxford and Cambridge, to enable them to secure the advantages of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus were the first community to avail themselves of this concession. They have opened a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, recognized and licensed by the University authorities, where twenty secular students and an unlimited number of religious may reside whilst following the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> course. <a href="../cathen/15225d.htm">St. Ursula's</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, also at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, likewise receives ladies and religious desirous of reading for honours in modern languages or for the <a href="../cathen/01756c.htm">B. A. degree</a> examination, which they may do either by attending the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> lectures, or by means of private tuition in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> itself. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> are not eligible for degrees, either at Oxford or at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, but they are allowed to attend almost all the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> lectures and sit for the degree examinations, receiving if successful a diploma instead of the degree itself. It is proposed to establish at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a> a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, similar to those of Newnham and Girton, which will probably, in accordance with the desires of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, be placed under the charge of one of the principal teaching orders. A committee to carry out the project has the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a> at its head.
<h2>Secondary education in Ireland and Scotland</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> compare favourably with those of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and their general character, scope, and conditions being practically similar, they need no further description here. There are in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> about ten different orders engaged in secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, with upwards of twenty <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> under their care, besides two training colleges - one at <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a> for primary teachers, under the Sisters of Notre Dame, and the other at <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a> for secondary teachers, conducted by the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the chief teaching orders are the Institute of the B. V. M. (with thirteen <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>), the Faithful Companions of Jesus (with three <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>), the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, and the St. Louis Nuns, each with several prominent secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The equivalent in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> of recognition and inspection by the Board of Education is the "Intermediate system", introduced in 1878, which produces practically the same results and has been adopted by most of the religious institutes engaged in secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. This system arranges examinations and awards medals, money prizes, and exhibitions. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> girls wishing to pursue a higher course after completing that of the Intermediate System, have had to take the examinations and degrees of the "Royal University of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>". To meet the demand several orders have colleges under their care in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, the most prominent and successful being Loreto College, belonging to the Institute of the B. V. M., and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> college. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> authorities do not insist on the formal training of secondary teachers; consequently each religious institute is responsible for the training of its own members. The results, however, of their work prove that this is no less thorough and efficient than that obtainable at one of the recognized English training colleges.
