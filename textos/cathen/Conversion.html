<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Conversion</h1>  

<p>(From the classical <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>converto, depon. convertor</em>, whence <em>conversio</em>, change, etc.).

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs3">Acts 15:3</a>), in patristic (St. Augustine, Civ. Dei, VIII, xxiv), and in later <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Latin, <em>conversion</em> refers to a moral change, a turning or returning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, in which sense it has passed into our modern languages. (For example, the "conversions" of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, and of St. Augustine.) In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the word <em>conversion</em> was often used in the sense of forsaking the world to enter the religious state. Thus <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> speaks of his conversion. The return of the sinner to a life of virtue is also called a conversion. More commonly do we speak of the conversion of an infidel to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, and most commonly of the conversion of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Every man is bound by the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> to seek the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, embrace it when found, and conform his life to its principles and <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>. And it is a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> defined by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> that man is able by the natural light of reason to arrive at the certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the existence of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a>. our Creator and Lord. The same council teaches that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift of God</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that it is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> commanded by the will, and that it is a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> act. The act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> then is an act of the understanding, whereby we firmly hold as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> whatever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has revealed, not because of its intrinsic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> perceived by the natural light of reason, but because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who can neither deceive nor be deceived, has revealed it. It is in itself an act of the understanding, but it requires the influence of the will which moves the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to assent. For many of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of revelation, being mysteries, are to some extent obscure. Yet, it is not a blind act, since the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has spoken is not merely probable but certain. The evidences for the fact of revelation are not, however, the motive of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; they are the grounds which render revelation credible, that is to say, they make it certain that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has spoken. And since <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that we may comply with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of embracing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith and persevering in it, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His only-begotten Son has instituted the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and has adorned it with obvious marks so that it may be known by all men as the guardian and teacher of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. These marks (or notes) of credibility belong to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone. Nay, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself by its admirable propagation, sublime <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and inexhaustible fecundity, by its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity and invincible stability, is a great and perpetual motive of credibility and irrefragable testimony of its Divine mission (see Conc. Vatic., De Fide, cap. 3).

<p>The first step, therefore, in the normal process of conversion is the investigation and examination of the credentials of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which often is a painful labor lasting for years. The external grace which draws a man's attention to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and causes him to begin his inquiry is as various and manifold as there are individual inquirers. It may even be something to one's temporal advantage, which was the case with <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. It may be the interest aroused in a great historical personage, such as <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, in the case of <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Friedrich von Hurter</a>. Whatever may have been the initial motive. if the study be pursued with an open mind, we hold that it will lead to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, i.e. to this certain conclusion: The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church. This <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> conviction. however, is not yet the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. One may hesitate, or refuse to take the next step, which is the "good will to believe" (<em>pius credulitatis affectus</em>). And this leads to the third and final act, the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself: I believe what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has revealed it. These three acts, especially the last, are, in accordance with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> acts. Then follows <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by which the believer is formally received into the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">BAPTISM</a>, VII, VIII.)

<p>Since the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of embracing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion is of natural and positive Divine right, it is evident that no <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> can forbid the fulfilling of this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, nor should any temporal considerations be allowed to interfere with a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> on which depends the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And because all are bound to enter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to receive all who apply for reception, of whatever age, sex, or condition they may be. Nay, in virtue of the Divine command to preach the Gospel to every creature, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is strictly bound to receive them, and no earthly authority can forbid the exercise of this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. To the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone it belongs to lay down the conditions for reception and to inquire into the interior dispositions of him who presents himself for admission into her bosom. The conditions are, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and profession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and the resolve to live in accordance with it. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to admit converts into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> belongs strictly speaking to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Usually all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> exercising the sacred ministry receive faculties for reconciling <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. When conditional <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is administered, sacramental confession is also required from the convert. It is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> clearly laid down in the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>. The order of proceedings is as follows: <ul><li>first, <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <li>second, conditional <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; <li>third, sacramental confession and conditional <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. (Tit. V, Cap. II, n. 240.)</ul>

<p>Force, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, or <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> may not be employed to bring about the conversion of an unbeliever. Such means would be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the nature of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the teaching and practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> forbid such means. <em>Credere voluntatis est,</em> to believe depends upon the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, says <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (II-II:10:8), and the minister of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, before administering the sacrament, is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to ask the question, "Wilt thou be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>"? And only after having received the answer, "I will", may he proceed with the sacred rite. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also forbids the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of children of unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> without the consent of the latter, unless the children have been cast away by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or are in imminent danger of death. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the unbaptized, nor does the State possess the power of using temporal means in spiritual things. The punishments formerly decreed against <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> were not intended to coerce men to accept outwardly what they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in their hearts, but to atone for a crime (<em>see</em> the article of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, loc. cit.). The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> legislation, both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular, clearly distinguished between the punishment to be inflicted for the crime of apostasy and the means of instruction to be used in order to bring about the resipiscence of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>. As <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">Bishop von Ketteler</a> says, "The punishment inflicted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> upon <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in comparatively few cases was not based upon the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> principle that conviction could be forced upon the mind by external means, but upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> has assumed <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> the fulfillment of which could be insisted upon. This punishment was only inflicted in particular cases and upon public and formal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>." Convert <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> like other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to have their children <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion.

<p>The Constitution of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a> proclaims complete separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> and guarantees full liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. In consequence the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of these States place no hindrance whatever in the way of conversions. It may also be said that on the whole the American people are socially tolerant towards converts. No wonder that in this country's conversions are comparatively more numerous than in most others. In the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British Empire</a> too, since the days of Catholic Emancipation in 1829, liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> prevails in theory as well as in practice, although there exists both in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> an established Church. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> disabilities have been almost entirely removed. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are only excluded from the throne and from a few of the highest offices of the State. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the tyrannical principle <em>cujus regio, illius religio</em> was proclaimed, in virtue of which the sovereign for the time being could impose his religion upon his subjects. He exercised the power both to forbid conversions to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to compel apostasy from it. In present-day <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the land. And although some union of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> exists, conversion does not involve any disabilities or the loss of any civil or political <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Formerly, however, most of the states prescribed the age before which conversions were not lawful, which was either fourteen or sixteen, or even eighteen. In <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a>, the public exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion historically was subjected to vexatious interference. In <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> is the State religion. Other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> are only tolerated. Under the czars, conversion from the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> was followed by grievous disabilities. By the <em>ukase</em> of 1905 certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and liberties were granted to other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>. The publication of the <em>ukase</em> was immediately followed by the return to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of many Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had been forced into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The Scandinavian countries were very intolerant till about the middle of the nineteenth century. <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> gave liberty to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in 1849, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> in 1860.
