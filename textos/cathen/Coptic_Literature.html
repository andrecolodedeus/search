<h1>Coptic Literature</h1>  

<p>Since the publication of the article <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">EGYPT</a>, under which Coptic literature was treated, important discoveries of entirely new Sahidic material have taken place, and considerable portions of the Sahidic Version from <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> known already have been given to the public by very competent scholars.
<h2>The Morgan Collection</h2>

<p>The most important of these discoveries was undoubtedly that of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Monastery of St. Michael in the Fay&ucirc;m (Spring, 1910). Most of the fifty-eight volumes of which it consisted found their way to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where they were purchased by J. Pierpont Morgan (Dec., 1911), in whose <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> (at New York) they are now preserved. 5000 volumes remained in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and, with a few fragments of the same origin, are kept in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Museum at Cairo. With the exception of one Fay&ucirc;mic and one Bohairic <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> the whole collection is in the Sahidic dialect. This had its home in Upper <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, but evidently it had spread in the Fay&ucirc;m as a literary language as early as the eighth century, for some of our <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> in the first quarter of the following century. The numerous colophons, however, all in the local Fay&ucirc;mic idiom, show that the latter still obtained as a spoken language. One of the most important features of the Morgan collection is that it consists of complete volumes, while other collections, yet reputed so valuable, those of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Paris, and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (see below under British Museum Collection), to name the principal ones, consist mostly of fragments. It is an inveterate habit with the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to tear the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> they discover or steal, so as to give each member of the tribe his share of the spoils, and also in the hope of securing higher prices by selling the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> piecemeal, a process fatal to literature, for while some leaves so treated will be scattered throughout the public or private collections of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and America, a good many more will either meet destruction or remain hidden indefinitely by the individual owners. Most of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the Monastery of St. Michael had already been divided into small lots of leaves and distributed among a number of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> when they were rescued at the cost of untold toil and expense.

<p>Mr. Morgan's collection is no less remarkable as a group of dated <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of absolutely certain <em>provenance</em>. We had a number of much older volumes or fragments, the ages of which, however, could not be determined with sufficient approximation, for lack of points of comparison, chronologically not too distant. The only points of comparison, so far, were two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> dated <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 1006 (British Museum Or. 1320) and 1003 (Naples, Zoega, XI). There are indeed a few colophons in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> with dates almost 100 years earlier but those colophons are generally separated from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> to which they belonged and consequently are of little or no use, the script of colophons being as a rule different from that in the body of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. Now the Morgan collection contains eighteen dates ranging from <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 832 to 914, so that our point of comparison is thrown practically 200 years nearer the older <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in question. Many of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are still in their original bindings, which are possibly the oldest, and certainly the best-authenticated, specimens of the art of bookbinding in that remote period. They consist of thick boards made of layers of papyrus sheets taken from older <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The covering is brown or deepened leather stamped with geometrical patterns, or cut though so as to show pieces of the same material, but of different colours (generally red or gold), slipped between the board and cover. In one case the decoration, exceedingly elaborate, was obtained by means of narrow strips of red parchment delicately stitched on the gilded cover of the boards and on the inner face of one of the boards, the name of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is reproduced in the same manner on the turned-in edge of the leather covering. A dozen of the volumes are adorned with full-page miniatures representing the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a> with her <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Son</a> at her breast or sitting in her lap, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. A wealth of decorations from the vegetable and animal realms runs along the margins and around the titles of the individual treatises, in almost all the volumes. It is the earliest and most complete attempt at illustrating and decorating yet discovered in Sahidic <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.

<p>The library of the Monastery of St. Michael was clearly a liturgical library, that is all its books were used in church. The following classified list of contents will give a fair <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of what a Coptic monastic library of that time was while it will also show the lacun&aelig; with which it has come down to us.
<h3>Bible</h3>

<h3 id="A">Old Testament</h3>

<p>Six complete books of the Sahidic version, namely, <a href="../bible/lev000.htm">Leviticus</a>, <a href="../bible/num000.htm">Numbers</a>, <a href="../bible/deu000.htm">Deuteronomy</a>, <a href="../bible/1sa000.htm">1 Samuel</a>, <a href="../bible/2sa000.htm">2 Samuel</a>, and <a href="../bible/isa000.htm">Isaias</a>, excepting <a href="../bible/isa001.htm#vrs1">1:1-19</a>, and <a href="../bible/isa007.htm#vrs7">7:7-8</a>.
<h3 id="B">New Testament</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a> (excepting <a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs33">Luke 4:33</a>-<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs30">9:30</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs62">9:62</a>-<a href="../bible/luk013.htm#vrs17">13:17</a>), the fourteen <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and the seven <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a> (I and II Peter, I-III John, James, and Jude). There is also a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Bohairic Version of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a>, fragmentary, unfortunately, and without indication of <em>provenance</em> or date, and it remains to decide whether it belonged to the Monastery of St. Michael. Still it is probably older than any of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> so far known of that version and on that account it may prove of considerable value for textual criticism.
<h3>Liturgy</h3>
<ul><li>(1) A complete Lectionary containing much valuable information as to the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, sanctoral, and the general run of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> year, and explaining several popular names for the various <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> which, so far, were either unknown or obscure and liable to misinterpretation. <li>(2) A <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and <li>(3) an Antiphonary, two books of which we had nothing but a few fragments that challenged all attempts at reconstruction. The sanctoral of the <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">antiphonary</a> is the oldest document of that kind in the Coptic literature.</ul>


<h3>Synaxary</h3>

<p>Over 100 <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, discourses, eulogies, Acts of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, lives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and miscellaneous treatises, to be read in church on the various <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feasts of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> year. These have been recently classified by categories of feast, retaining, however, in each category, the order of the calendar. <ul><li>(1) Feasts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>: Nativity (Choiac 29=25 Dec.), discourse by Demetrius, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; Epiphany (Tybi 11=6 Jan.), two discourses by <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> of Constance (Cyprus), and <a href="../cathen/11771a.htm">St. Peter of Alexandria</a>; Passion, discourse by <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius of Alexandria</a>; <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Resurrection</a> (<a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Sunday, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Wednesday, and <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Whitsunday</a>), one discourse by Evodius, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (probably <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> for Antioch), one by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, and five discourses by <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>; Pentecost, discourse by St. Athanasius of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>; Feast of the Holy Cross (Thoth 17=14 Sept.), discourse by <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, also a discourse by Theophilus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> on the Cross and the Good Thief, not assigned to any date. <li>(2) Feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary: Nativity and Death (Tybi 21=16 Jan.), discourse by <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>; Assumption (Mesori 16=15 Aug.), discourse by Theophilus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. <li>(3) Feasts of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a>: <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">St. Gabriel</a> (Choiac 22=18 Dec., Feast of the Annunciation?), discourse by Archelaus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Neapolis; St. Gabriel's Investiture in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, by <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">St. Stephen</a>; St. Michael, <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (Athyr 12=8 Nov.), two discourses by Macarius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tk&ocirc;ou and Severus of Antioch; St. Michael's investiture in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, by <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>; three discourses by St. Athanasius of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, Severianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06328a.htm">Gabala</a>, and Timothy of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>.

from Shenute, a volume on indifference in church-going. It is needless to say here that almost every one of the treatises under sections 1 to 6 of the Synaxary is either downright <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> or at least based on <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> literature.</ul>

<p>An official and detailed catalogue of this rich collection is in course of preparation and there is every prospect that the editing and translating of these venerable <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> will begin without unavoidable delay.
<h2>The British Museum's recent acquisitions</h2>

<p>The British Museum acquired of late a number of valuable Sahidic <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Three of these, Or. 5000, Or. 5001 (both found together in a ruined <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Upper <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>), and Or. 7594 (bought from a native antiquarian at Ghizer, Cairo) are on papyrus, and bear the appearance of high antiquity, especially Or. 7594, which the authorities of the British Museum date in the middle of the fourth century. The others, Or. 6780-6784, 6799-6804, 6806, 7021-7030, are on parchment, excepting a few on paper, and their dates of writing, so far as they are given, vary from <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 979 to 1053. These probably all come from the Monastery of St. Mercurius in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> west of Edf&ucirc; (Upper <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>). The following is a summary of contents of the twenty-five <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>:
