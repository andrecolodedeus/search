<h1>Cordova</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF CORDOVA (CORDUBENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, formerly suffragan of Toledo, since 1851 of Seville. It includes the province of the same name, with the exception of a few <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> that pertain to the <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Archdiocese of Seville</a>, while in return Cordova takes a portion of the civil province of <a href="../cathen/02193a.htm">Badajoz</a>. The Gospel, it is believed, was preached there in the Apostolic period, it being very probable that Apostles St. James the Greater and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, while preaching in various cities of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> may have sent thither some of their disciples; Cordova (<em>Colonia Patricia</em>) was then the chief city of B&aelig;tica, and the centre of <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusian</a> life. The name of the apostolic founder the of the See of Cordova is unknown, as the oldest extant documents do not antedate the third century. The conditions of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> in this early period were quite similar to those which obtained elsewhere in the Roman Empire &mdash; <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, suspicion, denunciation, enforced profession of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, etc. Many illustrious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Faustus, <a href="../cathen/08295a.htm">Januarius</a>, and others, suffered at Cordova; their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were afterwards eagerly sought by the other churches of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and even in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and elsewhere. The earliest known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (though not the founder of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>) is Severus, about 279; he was followed by Gratus and <a href="../cathen/02514a.htm">Berosus</a>. In 294 the famous <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius</a> became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cordova and immortalized it by his resistance to <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. Fifteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from the death of <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius</a> in 357 to 693, from which period to 839 no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. All <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> records, doubtless, perished in the course of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> domination that began in 711. During this time, the faithful could, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, worship freely, and retained their churches and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> on condition of paying a tribute for every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; frequently such tribute was increased at the will of the conqueror, and often the living had to pay for the dead. Many of the faithful then fled to Northern <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; others took refuge in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Sierras, and thus the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> shrank eventually to small proportions.

<p>In 786 the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> caliph, Abd-er Rahman I, began the construction of the great mosque of Cordova, now the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and compelled many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to take part in the preparation of the site and foundations. Though they suffered many vexations, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> continued to enjoy freedom of worship, and this tolerant attitude of the ameers seduced not a few <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from their original allegiance. Both <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> co-operated at this time to make Cordova a flourishing city, the elegant refinement of which was unequalled in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Under Abd-er Rahman II there came a change in the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> rulers, and a fierce <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> ensued, during which many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were accused of abusing the memory of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, of entering mosques, and of conspiracy against the Government. <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> fanaticism ran high. Among the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of this period are Perfectus, Flora, Maria, numerous <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Tabana in the Sierras, also Aurelius, Sabiniana, <a href="../cathen/01075b.htm">Abundius</a>, Amator, and others; the names of more than thirty are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. The most famous of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> is St. Eulogius, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, who was in 858 chosen <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo. For his encouragement of the confessors by his writings, "Memoriale sanctorum", "Apologeticus sanctorum martyrum", "Documentum martyrii", "Epistol&aelig;", he was eventually <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in 859. His life was written (P.L., CXV, 705-32) by Paulus Alvarus, a Scriptural scholar and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, who was not a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Baudissin notwithstanding (Eulogius und Alvarus, Leipzig, 1872). With slight interruptions this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> continued under succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Saul (850) and Valentius (662); it co-operated with the <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">Anthropomorphite</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Hostegesis and other causes to bring about a gap of a century and a half in the list of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cordova. In 962 Abd-er Rahman III was succeeded by his son Al-Hakim. Owing to the peace which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Cordova then enjoyed, some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their condition has been preserved, among other things the name of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Joannes, also the fact that, at that period, the citizens of Cordova, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, enjoyed so high a degree of literary culture that the city was known as the New Athens. From all quarters came students eager to drink at its founts of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Among the men afterwards famous who studied at Cordova were the scholarly <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Gerbert, destined to sit on the Chair of Peter as Sylvester II (999-1003), the Jewish rabbis Moses and <a href="../cathen/09540b.htm">Maimonides</a>, and the famous Spanish-Arabian commentator on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a> (Bourret, De Schol&acirc; Cordub&aelig; christian&acirc; sub Omiaditarum imperio, Paris, 1853). On account of the wretched administration of the successors of Add-er Rahman III, the invasion of the Almohades (1097), and the continuous peninsular <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> between <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, little is known of the episcopal succession in Cordova from the time of Bishop Joannes (988) to the reconquest of the city by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> under <a href="../cathen/06042a.htm">St. Ferdinand III</a> (1236). The long period (524 years) of humiliation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Cordova now came to an end, and a new epoch of prosperity and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> religious service began which was inaugurated by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and generosity of the saintly <em>conquistador</em> (Haines, <em>Christianity and Islam in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a></em>, London, 1889, 756-1031). Reference has already been made to the conversion of the mosque into a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; several <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were also established, and spacious <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were built for various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a>. A <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was established, some of the earlier <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches were restored, and some mosques were converted into churches. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, that in the earlier Hispano-Roman period had been very large, began to expand again and had added to it many cities of the <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Archdiocese of Seville</a>, which was yet in the power of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. The newly acquired territory was soon occupied by <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">Christian knights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm#christian">Christian families</a>, owing to the privileges and franchises granted by St. Ferdinand to such colonists. Bishop Lope de Fitero, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> about 1237, began a new episcopal series which has remained unbroken, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1898 being his seventy-third successor.

<p>Since the expulsion of the Moriscos and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at the end of the fifteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship alone has been exercised in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, if <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> belonging to a few <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> are excepted. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that since the eighteenth century the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">religious fervour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Cordova has considerably diminished, owing to the assimilation by the civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the liberal principles of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, the legalized usurpation of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, and a positivism nourished by the literature, the theatre, and the free press of the day. There remains, nevertheless, much of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charity and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> which distinguished the centuries after the reconquest, when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and faithful rivalled one another in generous endowment of <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, asylums, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and placed at the disposal of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a rich patrimony capable of supporting a numerous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and a continuous and splendid public worship. A steady sectarian propaganda, a lowering of the moral tone, and religious <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> have made many Cordovans quite lax in their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> practice; nevertheless, they do not at all wish to appear as deserting the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The palace of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> faces the former mosque, and in it are located ed all the administrative offices of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is composed of twenty canons, fifteen <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a>, and five <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> charged with various <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. There are 124 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, about 500 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 269 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is about 430,000; that of the city in 1900 was 58,275. The following <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations have houses in the city: <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Trinitarians, <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, and Diocesan Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Mary, the last named founded in 1876. In four or five other places in the diocese there are also <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, among them <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and Augustinians.

<p>In the near vicinity of Cordova is the solitude (<em>desierto</em>) of Our Lady of Bel&eacute;n, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of (fourteen) <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> under a common rule and leading a very austere life; they do not take <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacred orders</a>, and are governed by a brother superior (<em>hermano mayor</em>); their <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> is a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesian Fathers</a> alone are engaged in teaching; the other orders devote themselves to the contemplative life or conduct public worship. There are seventy-seven <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, of which twenty-seven are in Cordova and the rest scattered throughout the diocese. They number in all 1106 sisters. Some lead the contemplative life, others devote themselves to teaching or to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. The twelve <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> are cared for by 145 Sisters of Charity; among such institutions in the city are four homes for the aged, two refuges for young girls, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for the insane, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for chronic diseases with 239 patients, a boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> with 425 inmates, and a <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling asylum</a> containing 131 children. There is also a charitable restaurant (<em>Comedor de la Caridad</em>) in charge of six brothers, which provides good and abundant food for workingmen and poor <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> at very modest prices. The religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> institutes of the city for both sexes number twelve, and the pupils attending them 2023. The college of the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesian Fathers</a> has 325 boys. Outside of Cordova there are several <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. The Grand Seminary of San Pelagio at Cordova was founded in the sixteenth century of Dr. Maurticio Pazos y Figueroa, and enlarged in the eighteenth by Cardinal Salazar. It has fifteen professors and 125 <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students. Attached to the various <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are many lay confraternities devoted to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, or to the support of public worship. Of the early <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held at Cordova, two are important, those of 839 and 852. The Acts of the former were first printed by Fl&oacute;rez (Espa&ntilde;a sagrada, XV; Hefele, IV, 99). It was held against fanatical <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, probably from Northern Africa, and known as "Casiani", who professed loose doctrines regarding marriage, rejected veneration of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, demanded more rigour in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, declared unclean certain foods, insisted on receiving the Eucharistic Host each in his own hand, etc. The synod of 852 reproved those <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> sought the occasion of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and declared that such had no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the veneration due to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XIV, 970; Hefele, IV, 179).
