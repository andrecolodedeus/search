<h1>Core, Dathan, and Abiron</h1>  

<p>Leaders of a revolt against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> (<a href="../bible/num016.htm">Numbers 16</a>).

<p>Core was the son of Isaar, of the Caathite <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>; Dathan and Abiron were the sons of Eliab, the son of Phallu, of the tribe of <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a>. A fourth leader is mentioned, Hon, the son of Pheleth, likewise a <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Rubenite</a>; but as the name does not again appear, a corruption of the text is rightly suspected. Core was the head of the rebellion, whence it is called the sedition of Core (<a href="../bible/num016.htm#vrs49">Numbers 16:49</a>; <a href="../bible/num026.htm#vrs9">26:9</a>; <a href="../bible/num027.htm#vrs3">27:3</a>; <a href="../bible/jud001.htm#vrs11">Jude 11</a>), and the rebels are styled the congregation of Core (<a href="../bible/num016.htm#vrs40">Numbers 16:40</a>; <a href="../bible/sir045.htm#vrs22">Sirach 45:22</a>).

<p>The rebel faction consisted of three parties with different motives and different aims.

<ul>
<li>Many of the people were not yet reconciled to the exclusive <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> instituted at Sinai, and desired the restoration of the old order, in which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions were exercised by the oldest member of each <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.
<li>The non-Aaronic <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> bore it ill that the prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> should be confined to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Aaron, while they occupied the position of mere servants, and they demanded that they also be admitted to exercise <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions.
<li>Lastly the <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Rubenites</a> were aggrieved because their tribe was deprived of the leadership, which naturally should belong to it as being descended from the oldest son of <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>.
</ul>

<p>But all were animated by jealousy of the power of the house of Amram, in which the civil and religious authority was concentrated, and all aimed at its overthrow. The two first parties, however, desired the removal of Moses from power, only in so far as he was an obstacle to the realization of their claims, whereas with the <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Rubenites</a> this removal was the main object.

<p>In the account of the revolt neither time nor place is mentioned. But it must have occurred shortly after leaving Sinai, when the Aaronic <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was still a recent institution. It probably took place at Cades, after the attempt to penetrate into the Promised Land had ended disastrously near Horma (<a href="../bible/num014.htm#vrs40">Numbers 14:40 sqq.</a>), and the people had begun to realize that there was no escape from the sentence condemning them to wander forty years in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. The taunting words of Dathan and Abiron (<a href="../bible/num016.htm#vrs13">Numbers 16:13, 14</a>) point to such a situation. Core and two hundred and fifty leading men of different tribes (cf. <a href="../bible/num027.htm#vrs3">Numbers 27:3</a>) &mdash; Dathan and Abiron for some unknown reason were not with them &mdash; went to Moses and demanded the abolition of the exclusive <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. "Enough for you", they said; "all the congregation consisteth of holy ones, and the Lord is with them: why lift you up yourselves above the people of the Lord?" Moses directed them to bring their <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a> (fire-pans) on the morrow to offer <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> with Aaron before the Lord; the Lord would choose between them. When the next day Core and his two hundred and fifty companions offered <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> before the door of the tabernacle, they were destroyed by fire from the Lord. In the meanwhile Moses went to the dwellings of Dathan and Abiron, who had refused to obey his summons to appear before him, and warned the people to depart from the tents of Core, Dathan, and Abiron, lest they should share the dreadful punishment about to be inflicted on the two last. Hardly had he done speaking when the earth broke asunder and swallowed Dathan and Abiron and their households and all the men that appertained to Core.

<p>The sons of Core did not perish, however (<a href="../bible/num026.htm#vrs10">Numbers 26:10, 11</a>), and later we find their descendants among the singers (<a href="../bible/1ch006.htm#vrs37">1 Chronicles 6:37</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch020.htm#vrs19">2 Chronicles 20:19</a>; Psalms <a href="../bible/psa041.htm">41</a>, <a href="../bible/psa043.htm">43</a>, <a href="../bible/psa048.htm">48</a>, <a href="../bible/psa083.htm">83</a>, <a href="../bible/psa084.htm">84</a>, <a href="../bible/psa086.htm">86</a>, <a href="../bible/psa087.htm">87</a>), or among the door-keepers of the temple (<a href="../bible/1ch009.htm#vrs19">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>; 26:1, 19). Moses ordered the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a> of Core and his companions to be beaten into plates and fastened to the altar as a warning to those who would usurp the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.

<p>The critical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> sees in the story of this rebellion a clumsy combination of three distinct narratives; one relating a revolt under Dathan and Abiron against the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> of Moses; another containing an account of a rising of representatives of the people under Core, who is not a <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority of the tribe of Levi; and a third, which is merely a retouched version of the second, telling of the struggle of the non-Aaronic <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> under Core, who is now a <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levite</a>, against the exclusive <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> vested in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Aaron. But it may be asked what possible object a redactor could have had in combining the narrative of a rebellion against <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> with another having for its moral to warn against usurpation of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The story presents nothing improbable. We need not search deeply into history to find similar examples of parties with different, or even conflicting interests, uniting for a common end. It may, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, be resolved into two fairly complete narratives. But many an historical account can thus be divided by using the arbitrary methods here applied, picking out sentences or parts of sentences here and there and rejecting as later additions whatever militates against division. The literary argument is too weak and too uncertain to base a theory upon it.
