<h1>Cormac MacCuilenan</h1>  

<p>(836-908).

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and King of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, Cormac MacCquilenan was of the race of Eoghanact, of Southern <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and in his early years received a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in one of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and afterwards appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>. In the year 900 he became, on account of his descent, King of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, and thus were combined in his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the two offices of spiritual and temporal ruler of Leth Moga, as the southern portion of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was called. The <em>ardri</em> (high king), Flann, assisted by the King of Leinster, led his forces into the Southern Province (906), and was met by the Munstermen under Cormac at Moylena (Tullamore). The <em>ardri</em> suffered a signal defeat. Later on, however (908) Flann, assisted by Ceorbhall, King of Leinster, and Cathal, King of Connaught, returned to the attack, apparently because Cormac, instigated by Flaherty, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Inniscathay, had claimed tribute from Leinster, and had even signified his intention of assuming the position of <em>ardri.</em> The battle was fought at the present Ballymoon; the Munstermen suffered a complete defeat and Cormac was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> in the battle. An <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Glossary called "Sanas Chormaic", containing etymologies and explanations of over 1400 <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> words has come down to us. Though, etymologically, the work is of little value, yet on account of the light it throws upon many ancient <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> customs and institutions it is of great importance to the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">historian</a>. The "Glossary of Cormac" is said to be only a part of the "Saltair Chaisil", also attributed to Cormac. This work, if it ever existed, has disappeared, or, as W. Stokes thinks, it is more likely that at best the "Saltair Chaisil" was only a collection of transcripts of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> from the hands of different writers. The above-mentioned "Sanas Chormaic", or "Cormac's Glossary", was translated and annotated by <a href="../cathen/11210c.htm">John O'Donovan</a> and edited by W. Stokes (Calcutta, 1868). See Stokes, "Three Irish Glossaries" (London, 1862).
