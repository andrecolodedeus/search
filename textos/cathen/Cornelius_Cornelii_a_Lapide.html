<h1>Cornelius Cornelii a Lapide</h1>  

<p>(Cornelis Cornelissen van den Steen)

<p>Flemish <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, b. at Bocholt, in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> Limburg, 18 December, 1567; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 12 March, 1637. He studied humanities and philosophy at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> of Maestricht and Cologne, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> first, for half a year, at the <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">University of Douai</a>, and afterwards for four years at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>; he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, 11 June, 1592, and, after two years' noviciate and another year of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 24 December, 1595. After teaching philosophy for half a year, he was made professor of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1596 and next year of Hebrew also. Twenty years later, in 1616, he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the same capacity, where, on the 3rd of November, he assumed the office which he filled with such renown for many years after. The latter years of his life, however, he seems to have devoted exclusively to finishing and correcting his celebrated commentaries. He was a sincerely <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and an exemplary religious. During his professorship at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> he liked to spend his holidays preaching and administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, especially at the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Scherpenheuvel (Montaigu). With moving simplicity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he portrayed himself in an emotional <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to the Prophets at the end of his commentary on Daniel: "For nearly thirty years I suffer with and for you with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> the continual <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of illness, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of study and writing; obtain for me also, I beseech you, to crown all, the fourth <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, of blood. For you I have spent my vital and animal spirits; I will spend my blood too." With his brethren in religion at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he enjoyed so high a reputation for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> that, when he died, they gave him a separate burial place, in order to be the more certain of finding his bones when eventually, as they hoped, he should receive the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>.

<p>Cornelius a Lapide wrote ample commentaries on all the books of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Canon of Scripture, with the exception only of Job and the Psalms. Even before leaving <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, he edited the "Commentaries in omnes divi Pauli epistolas" (1614) and, "in Pentateuchum" (1616), both at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. The commentaries on the Greater and Lesser Prophets, on the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, the Canonical Epistles and the Apocalypse, Ecclesiasticus and the Proverbs, followed later on. The rest were edited only after his death; but all of them have been several times re-edited, both separately and collectively. Of the Commentary on the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> he himself was permitted to see at least eleven editions. The complete series, with Job and the Psalms added by other hands, appeared at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1681, 1714; at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1717, 1740, 1798; at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, 1732; at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, 1838; at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 1839-42, 1865 and 1866; at <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, 1843-46; at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 1854; at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1855 and 1856; at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1857; at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1859-63. The best-mentioned edition has been enriched by Crampon and P&eacute;ronne with annotations from more recent interpreters. All these commentaries are on a very large scale. They explain not only the literal, but also the allegorical, tropological, and anagogical sense of the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a>, and furnish a large number of quotations from the Fathers and the later interpreters of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Like most of his predecessors and contemporaries, a Lapide intends to serve not only the historical and scientific study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, but, even more, the purposes of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> meditation, and especially of <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> exposition. An extract from the commentary on the Acts appeared in 1737 at Tyrnau, under the title: "Effigies Sancti Pauli, sive <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> vit&aelig; apostolic&aelig;". A large work in 4 vols., "Les tr&eacute;sors de Cornelius a Lapide: extraits de ses commentaires de l'&eacute;criture sainte &#224; l'usage des pr&eacute;dicateurs, des communaut&eacute;s et des familles chr&eacute;tiennes", by the Abb&eacute; Barbier, was published at <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1856, re-edited at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1859, 1872, 1876, 1885, 1896; and an Italian translation of the same by F. M. Faber, appeared at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, 1869-70, in 10 vols., 16 mo.

<p>These numerous editions show how highly these works are estimated by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> voices have joined in the appreciation. G. H. Goetzius (Leipzig, 1699) wrote an academical dissertation, "Exercitatio theologica de Cornelii a Lapide Commentariis in Sacram Scripturam", in which he praises the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> author as the most important of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Scriptural writers. An English translation of the complete commentaries was undertaken by the Rev. Thomas W. Moseman, an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, under the title, "The great Commentary of Cornelius a Lapide" (London, 1876&mdash;). A <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the Vatican Library contains an Arabic translation of the Commentary on the Apocalypse, by Yusuf ibn Girgis (beginning of the eighteenth century). The same <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> writer is said to have translated the Commentary on the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>.
