<h1>Cornelius Jansen, the Elder</h1>  

<p>(<em>Also</em> Jansens, Janssen, Janssenius <em>or</em> Jansenius Gandaviensis).

<p>Exegete, born at Hulst, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, 1510; died at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 11 April, 1576. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">Brethren of the Common Life</a> (called at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> the Hieronymites), and later studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and Oriental languages at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. After he had become a licentiate of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in 1534, he lectured, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Abbey of Tongerloo, to the young <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> until 1542, from which date until 1562 he discharged the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Martin at Courtrai (Kortryk) with great success. Having finally attained the degree of Doctor of Theology in 1562, he was immediately appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, became in the following year dean of the collegiate <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. James, and attended the last sessions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> as delegate of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. On his return, King Philip II appointed him first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the newly founded <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">See of Ghent</a>, which dated only from 1559. For a long time he refused to assume the dignity, on account of the difficult conditions in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and was not <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> until 1568, by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he devoted himself especially to checking the advance of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and to carrying out with the greatest exactness the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. With this object in view, he founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> in 1569, held <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> in 1571 and 1574, and published a ritual for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was entrusted with the compilation of a ritual to be used in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, but did not finish it. While at <a href="../cathen/14776a.htm">Tongerloo</a> he wrote a great deal, and, as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Courtrai, had already become widely known for his <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> work.

<p>Among Jansen's writings is the "Concordia evangelica." (Louvain, 1529), to which he later added the "Commentarius in Concordiam et totem historiam evangelicam" (Louvain, 1572), undoubtedly his best work. He published also: "Commentarius in Proverbia Salomonis" (Louvain, 1567), and "Commentarius in Ecclesiasticum" (Louvain, 1569), both of which were republished in one work at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in 1589; "Commentarius in omnes Psalmos Davidicos" (Louvain, 1569), with an introduction to each psalm, an excellent paraphrase of the text, and explanations of the difficult passages; "Paraphrases in ea Veteris Testamenti Cantica, quae per ferias singulas totius anni usus ecclesiasticus observat" (Louvain, 1569). After his death appeared "Annotationes in Librum Sapientiae" (Louvain, 1577).

<p>Cornelius Jansen was one of the most distinguished among the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> of the sixteenth century, and his masterpiece, the aforesaid "Concordia, Evangelica" was epoch-making in the history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, for he insisted on the literal interpretation, as against the mystical interpretation of his predecessors, emphasized also the importance of the original text, and of a profound study of Oriental languages as aids to a full comprehension of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>.
