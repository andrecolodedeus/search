<h1>Cornelius O'Devany</h1>  

<p>(Conchobhar O'Duibheannaigh)

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Down and Connor</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, b. about 1532; d. at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 11 February, 1612 (N. S.). He was a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> of Donegal Convent, and while in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1582 was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Down and Connor</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 2 February, 1583. In 1588 he was committed to Dublin Castle. Failing to convict him of any crime punishable with death, Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam sought authority from Burghley to "be rid of such an obstinate enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and so rank a traitor to her Majesty as no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he is". He lay in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> until November, 1590, being then released ostensibly on his own petition but doubtless through policy. He was protected by O'Neill until 1607, and escaped arrest until the middle of 1611, when, almost eighty years old, he was taken while administering confirmation and again committed to Dublin Castle. On 28 January, 1612, he was tried for high treason, found guilty by the majority of a packed jury, and sentenced to die on 1 February (O.S.). He was drawn on a cart from the Castle to the gallows beyond the river; the whole route was crowded with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> lamenting and begging his blessing. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> pestered him with ministrations and urged him to confess he died for treason. "Pray let me be", he answered, "the viceroy's messenger to me here present, could tell that I might have life and revenue for going once to that temple", pointing to a tower opposite. He <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> the gallows before mounting, and then proceeding to exhort the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to constancy, he was thrown off, cut down alive, and quartered. With him suffered Patrick O'Loughran, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> arrested at <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>. The people, despite the guards, carried off the halter, his clothes, and even fragments of his body and chips of the gallows. They <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> all night by the remains, an infirm man was reported cured by touching them, and Mass after Mass was said there from Midnight until day. Such was the concourse that the viceroy ordered the members to be buried on the spot, but next night the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> exhumed them and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> them in St. James's Churchyard. A list of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> compiled by Dr. O'Devany was used by <a href="../cathen/13207a.htm">Rothe</a> in his "Analecta".
