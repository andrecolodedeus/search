<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Cornelius van Zierikzee</h1>  

<p>Born at Zierikzee (whence he takes his surname), a town in the Province of Zeeland, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, about 1405, d. 21 Feb., 1462. The strict observance of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Rule, upheld and propagated throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">St. Bernardine of Siena</a> and St. John Capistran, was early introduced into <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. At twenty Cornelius entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> in the Province of Cologne, which at that time included the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. It was famous for the number and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of its members, among whom were several Scotsmen who had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> on the Continent.

<p>This revival of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> life under the guidance of St. Bernardine no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> came to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of King James I of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, whose poetic spirit was in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> ideal. In 1436 the king requested the superiors of the order that he might have Friars of the Observance sent into his kingdom; but it was not until after the provincial chapter of the Observants held at Gouda in 1447, and apparently because of a fresh application by his son King James II, that it was decided to comply with the royal wishes. John Perioche de Mauberg, Vicar-general of the Ultramontine Observants, selected Fr. Cornelius as head of the mission. Fr. Cornelius was accompanied by six associates, of whom at least one, Fr. John Richardson, a graduate of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, was a Scot; they were received with enthusiasm by all classes. Within a few years after the arrival of the Observants in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> they established nine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in different towns; the <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> for admission to the order were numerous; youths belonging to the best <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> renounced the world to embrace the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> life of poverty. Among those who received the habit from Fr. Cornelius were: Jerome Lindsay, U.J.D., of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, son of the Earl of Crawford, commemorated in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Martyrology with title of blessed, pre-eminent for his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, and spirit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; David Crannok, who was physician to King James II and his consort Queen Margaret; he succeeded Fr. Cornelius in the government of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>; Robert Keith, renowned for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of his life, a member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Earl Marishal; later on Robert Stuart, kinsman of King James V. The General Chapter of the Observants held at Mount-Luzon (Bourbonnais) erected the Scottish <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> into a province, and granted it a seal representing St. Bernardine holding a tablet with the Holy Name <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> on it and three mitres at his feet, to mark that the Scottish province owed its origin to the companions of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>.

<p>The Scottish <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> enjoyed a great reputation throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for adhering most conscientiously and strictly to the poverty and austerity of the order. James IV wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1506 in praise of the Observants in his kingdom and their works. The Scottish province was in a flourishing state when the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">religious revolution</a> broke out and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were destroyed. In 1560 Father John Patrick, Minister Provincial, accompanied by over one hundred fathers, left <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, where they were hospitably recognized and incorporated in the provinces of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. In 1462 Father Cornelius, worn out by his labours and austerities, left <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> for his own province of Cologne, where he died in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. It is said that many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> took place at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. The writings of Father Cornelius, which consist of "Conciones ad populum Scotiae", "Sermones ad Fratres", "Epistolas plures", have never been published.
