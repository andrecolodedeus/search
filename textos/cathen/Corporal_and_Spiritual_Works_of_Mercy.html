<h1>Corporal and Spiritual Works of Mercy</h1>  

<p><em>Mercy</em> as it is here contemplated is said to be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> influencing one's will to have compassion for, and, if possible, to alleviate another's misfortune. It is the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> that although mercy is as it were the spontaneous product of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>, yet it is to be reckoned a special <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> adequately distinguishable from this latter. In fact the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> in cataloguing it consider it to be referable to the <a href="../cathen/12589c.htm">quality</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> mainly because, like <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it controls relations between distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. It is as they say <em>ad alterum</em>. Its motive is the misery which one discerns in another, particularly in so far as this <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> is deemed to be, in some sense at least, involuntary. Obviously the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> which is to be succoured can be either of body or <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hence it is customary to enumerate both corporal and spiritual works of mercy. The traditional enumeration of the corporal works of mercy is as follows:

<ul> <li>To feed the hungry; <li>To give drink to the thirsty; <li>To clothe the naked; <li>To harbour the harbourless; <li>To visit the sick; <li>To ransom the captive; <li>To <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">bury</a> the dead. </ul>

<p>The spiritual works of mercy are:

<ul> <li>To instruct the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; <li>To counsel the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>; <li>To <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">admonish sinners</a>; <li>To bear wrongs patiently; <li>To forgive offences willingly; <li>To comfort the afflicted; <li>To <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the living and the <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">dead</a>. </ul>

<p>It will be seen from these divisions that the works of mercy practically coincide with the various forms of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>. It is thus that <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> regards them. The word <em><a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a></em> of course is a corruption of the Greek <em>elenmosyne</em> (mercy). The doing of works of mercy is not merely a matter of exalted <a href="../cathen/04435a.htm">counsel</a>; there is as well a strict <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precept</a> imposed both by the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">positive Divine law</a> enjoining their performance. That the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> enjoins works of mercy is based upon the principle that we are to do to others as we would have them do to us.

<p>The Divine command is set forth in the most stringent terms by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the failure to comply with it is visited with the supreme penalty of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a> (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs41">Matthew 25:41</a>): "Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a> which was prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">angels</a>. For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink. I was a stranger, and you took me not in; naked, and you covered me not; sick and in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and you did not visit me", etc. Here it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> there is mention directly and explicitly of only the corporal works of mercy. As, however, the spiritual works of mercy deal with a distress whose relief is even more imperative as well as more effective for the grand purpose of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>, the injunction must be supposed to extend to them also. Besides there are the plain references of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to such works as <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">fraternal correction</a> (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs15">Matthew 18:15</a>) as well as the forgiveness of injuries (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs14">Matthew 6:14</a>). It has to be remembered however that the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precept</a> is an affirmative one, that is, it is of the sort which is always binding but not always operative, for lack of matter or occasion or fitting circumstances. It <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliges</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> say, <em>semper sed non pro semper</em>. Thus in general it may be said that the determination of its actual <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> force in a given case depends largely on the degree of distress to be aided, and the capacity or condition of the one whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> in the matter is in question. There are easily recognizable limitations which the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precept</a> undergoes in practice so far as the performance of the corporal works of mercy are concerned. These are treated in the article on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">Alms and Almsgiving</a>. Likewise the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> imposing spiritual works of mercy is subject in individual instances to important reservations. For example, it may easily happen that an altogether special measure of tact and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, or, at any rate, some definite superiority is required for the discharge of the oftentimes difficult task of <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">fraternal correction</a>. Similarly to instruct the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, counsel the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, and console the sorrowing is not always within the competency of every one. To bear wrongs patiently, to forgive offences willingly, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the living and the <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">dead</a> are things from which on due occasion no one may dispense himself on the pleas that he has not some special array of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> required for their observance. They are evidently within the reach of all. It must not be forgotten that the works of mercy demand more than a humanitarian basis if they are to serve as instruments in bringing about our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">eternal salvation</a>. The proper motive is indispensable and this must be one drawn from the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>.

<p>Finally it is interesting to note that for the exercise of the sixth among the corporal works of mercy two <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders have at different times in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> been instituted. In the year 1198 the <a href="../cathen/15045d.htm">Trinitarians</a> were founded by St. John of Matha and <a href="../cathen/06033c.htm">St. Felix of Valois</a>, and just twenty years later <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a> and <a href="../cathen/12671c.htm">St. Raymond of Pennafort</a> established the <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Order of Our Lady of Ransom</a>. Both of these communities had as their chief scope the recovery of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who were held captive by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">infidels</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">religious body</a> which owes its origin to <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a>, the members took a fourth <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to surrender their own persons in place of those whom they were not otherwise able to redeem from <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slavery</a>.
