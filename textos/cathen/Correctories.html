<h1>Correctories</h1>  

<p>Correctories are the text-forms of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> resulting from the critical emendation as practised during the course of the thirteenth century. Owing to the carelessness of transcribers, the conjectural corrections of critics, the insertion of glosses and paraphrases, and especially to the preference for readings found in the earlier Latin versions, the text of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> was corrupted at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. About 550 <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> made an attempt at restoring the purity of the Latin text. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> entrusted the same labour to <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, who presented his royal patron with a corrected copy in 801. Similar attempts were repeated by Theodulphus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> [787(?)- 821], <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> (1070-1089), Stephen Harding, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> (1109-1134), and Deacon Nicolaus Maniacoria (about the beginning of the thirteenth century). At this period the need of a revised Latin text of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> became more imperative than ever. When, towards the end of the twelfth century, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> were organized into the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and its various faculties adopted the same reference texts, the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, too, adhered to a uniform text of the Latin Bible. It cannot be ascertained at present whether this adoption was owing to the chance prevalence of a certain <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> or to the critical work of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, whether it was the effect of an official choice of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> or of a prevailing custom; at any rate, the almost general adoption of this text threw into oblivion a great number of genuine readings which had been current in the preceding centuries, and perpetuated a text, uniform, indeed, but very corrupt. This is the so-called "Biblia Parisiensis", or <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Bible; no copy is known to exist in our days. The thirteenth century reacted against this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by a series of correctories. Father <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a> enumerates as many as thirteen groups, but it is more convenient to reduce then to three classes: the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, and the allied correctories.
<h2>Dominican correctories</h2>

<p>The general chapter of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> held in 1236 connects a corrected text of the Latin Bible with the members of the province of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; it <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that all Bibles should be conformed to this. Little more is known of this work but the following correctories are more noted: <ul><li>(1) The "Biblia Senonensis", or the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, is not the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Bible as approved of by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, nor is it a particular text adopted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority of that city, but it is a correction of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Bible prepared by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers residing there. Whatever be the value of this correctory, it did not meet with the approval of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, as may be inferred from an <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of the general chapter held in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1256. Quotations from it found in the "Correctorium Sorbonicum" resemble the readings of the Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> No. 17 in the National Library, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The fathers of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> failed to produce a satisfactory text because they were too sparing in their emendation of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Bible. <li>(2) Hugues of Saint-Cher tried to restore the primitive text of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a>, which in his day was practically identical with the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Bible, by removing its glosses and all foreign accretions. But instead of having recourse to the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> text he compared the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Bible with the original Hebrew and Greek readings, thus furnishing a new version rather than a correctory. <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a> calls his work "the worst corruption, the destruction of the text of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". Eight <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Hugues' correctory are still extant. <li>(3) Theobald is the name of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Father who is usually connected with the next correction of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> text, which appeared about 1248. The text of this too resembles that of the Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> No. 17 in the National Library, Paris, and is thus related to the "Correctorium Senonense". It may be identical with the "Correctio Parisiensis secunda", quoted in the "Correctorium Sorbonicum". <li>(4) Another correctory was prepared about 1256 in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Saint-Jacques, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> thus corrected contains a text as bad as, if not worse than the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the readings of which were carried into the new correctory. The principles of Hugues of Saint-Cher were followed by the correctors, who marked in red the words to be omitted, and added marginal notes to explain changes and suggest variants. They are more copious in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> than in the New. The autograph is preserved in the National Library, Paris, Manuscripts lat. 16,719-16,722.</ul>
<h2>Franciscan correctories</h2>

<p>The great <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> writer, <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a>, was the first to formulate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> principles which ought to guide the correction of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a>; his religious brethren endeavoured to apply them, though not always successfully. <ol><li>The "Correctorium Sorbonicum", probably the work of William of Brittany, derives its name from the fact that the thirteenth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in which the emendations were made belonged to the Library of the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, though at present it is kept in the National Library, Paris, Manuscript lat. 15554, fol. 147-253. The marginal and interlinear glosses are derived from the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Bible and the correctory of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Father Theobald; the make-up of the work imitates the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> correctories. <li>The "Correctorium Vaticanum" owes its name to the circumstance that its first known <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> was the Cod. Vaticanus lat. 3466, though at present eight other copies are known, belonging to the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century. Its author is William de Mara, of Oxford, a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a>, whose principles and methods he follows. Though acquainted with several Latin and Hebrew <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14454b.htm">Targum</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentaries</a> of Rashi, and the original texts, he relied more on the authority of the early <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> text. There are some faults in the correctory, resulting mainly from the author's limited <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek. <li>G&eacute;rard de Huy was a faithful follower of <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon's</a> principles; the old Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and the readings of the Fathers are his first authority, and only when they disagree does he have recourse to the original texts. Unfortunately he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> older than those of the ninth and tenth centuries containing a text of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> recension. But G&eacute;rard <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the history of the versions and the origin of the textual corruptions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>. He corrected the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Bible and gave an account of his emendations in his marginal notes. <li>Two more <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> correctories must be noted: Manuscript 61 (Toulouse), of the fifteenth century, reproduces the correctory of G&eacute;rard de Buxo, of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, a work rather <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> than critical in character; Manuscript 28 (Einsiedeln), of the beginning of the fourteenth century, contains the work of John of Cologne.</ol>
<h2>Allied correctories</h2>

<p>Mangenot mentions six other groups of correctories which have not been fully investigated as yet. Two of them are allied to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> correctory of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Saint-Jacques; one is represented by the Manuscript lat. 15,554, fol. 1-146, National Library, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; the other by Cod. Laurent., Plut., XXV, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>., cod. 4, fol. 101-107 (Florence), and by Manuscript 131, fol. 1, Arsenal, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Two other groups are allied to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> correctories; one, represented by Cod. 141, lat. class. I, fol. 121-390, Marciana (Venice), depends on William de Mara and G&eacute;rard de Huy; the other, found in Manuscript 82, Borges. (Rome), depends on G&eacute;rard de Huy. Finally two very brief correctories are to be found in Manuscript 492, Antoniana, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and in Manuscript Cent. I, 47, fol. 127, N&uuml;renberg.
