<h1>Corsica</h1>  

<p>The third island of the Mediterranean in point of size, only <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> being of greater extent. The distance from the French seaport Antibes, on the Riviera, to Calvi, the port of Corsica nearest to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, is one hundred and eleven miles. There is a brisk commerce between Leghorn, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Bastia, in Corsica, the voyage being made in five hours.

<p>The island is mountainous and well watered, a large part being covered with forests and almost impenetrable thickets called <em>maquis</em>. The climate is mild on the coast, but cold in elevated regions. The area of Corsica is 3367 square miles, the population 300,000. Both the natives of the interior and those of the coast, whose ancestors were <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, are nearly all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The island was early visited by the <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a> and the Phocians who established colonies there. For a time it belonged to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, but was taken by the Romans, who retained possession from 260 B.C. to the end of the fifth century of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>. But they never subdued the mountain tribes of the interior, and even in the time of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> (590-604) there were many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> in Corsica, which long retained its early reputation as a wild and unhospitable island. On the fall of the Western Empire (476) Corsica was taken by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, but was recovered by Belisarius, only to be captured by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> under Totila. Eventually, however, it became subject to the exarchs of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and remained a Byzantine possession until the eighth century. At the end of the sixth and the beginning of the seventh century the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> owned large landed estates in Corsica. By the Donation of Pepin the Short (754-55) the island came under the civil sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (<a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a>, ed. Duchesne, I, 498; II, 104, note 35). From the eighth to the eleventh century it was frequently plundered by <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> pirates. <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> then set up a claim of overlordship which was soon disputed by <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. In 1300 the latter made good its claim to the civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> influence hitherto exercised by <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, and despite numerous revolutions (Sampiero, 1567; Baron Neuhof, 1729; Paoli, 1755) held at least a nominal authority until 1768. In that year <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> ceded Corsica to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, since which time the island has remained a French province. Ajaccio, its chief town, is historically famous as the birthplace of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>.

<p>It has been asserted that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced into Corsica in Apostolic times. <a href="../cathen/15119b.htm">Ughelli</a>, in his "Italia Sacra", says of <a href="../cathen/09660a.htm">Mariana</a>, one of the oldest settlements: "It received the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and has had its own <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, ever since the times of the Apostles"; but this would be difficult to establish. Another tradition which finds favour with historians is, that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was spread in the island by confessors of the Faith exiled thither (Hergenr&ouml;ther, I, in French tr., Paris, 1901, p. 297). The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> say the country was entirely <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in A.D. 439. It gave <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; Mgr. de la Foata, in his "Recherches" (see bibliography <em>infra</em>), cites the names of three Corsican <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> of the Observance, Bernardino Alberti, Franceschino Mucchieli. Teofilo Designorio, whose virtues had been authoritatively declared heroic, and also claims as Corsicans St. Laurina, virgin and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, whose festival was celebrated as a first-class feast in the ancient Diocese of Aleria, St. Parthoeus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, saint Vindemialis and St. Florentius. It is said, also, that St. Julia was a Corsican.

<p>We have seen that before and after 600 Corsica was in close dependence on the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and always remained so, (see Cappelletti, Le Chiese d'Italia, XVI, 307 sqq.). In 1077 <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> named as his <em>vicarius</em> for Corsica the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. In 1092 <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a> made its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> suffragans of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. In 1133 <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, having granted the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, gave him for suffragans the Corsican Bishops of <a href="../cathen/09660a.htm">Mariana</a>, Nebbio, and Accia, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> retaining as suffragans the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/01238b.htm">Ajaccio</a>, Aleria, and Sagona. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09660a.htm">Mariana</a> and Accia were united, 30 January, 1563. About 1580 the <a href="../cathen/01299b.htm">Blessed Alexander Sauli</a>, known as the "Apostle of Corsica" awoke the islanders to a more earnest <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> on the model of those decreed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. At the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> there were five <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in Corsica: Mariana and Accia, Nebbio, Aleria, Sagona, and <a href="../cathen/01238b.htm">Ajaccio</a>. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 12 July, 1790, of the National Assembly at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, whose members had voted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, reduced these five <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> to one, giving to Bastia the pastoral care of the whole island. On 8 May, 1791, the election of the Constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> took place. The choice of the electors fell upon the canon Ignatius Francis Guasco, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/09660a.htm">Mariana</a>, and Provost of the Cathedral. He, however, made a public and solemn recantation 22 December, 1794. The <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the French Republic, which officially restored <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, made of Corsica a single diocese with Ajaccio as its episcopal city. St. Euphrasius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, is the patron of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Sts. Julia and Devota were declared patronesses of the island by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the S. C. of Rites, 5 August, 1809, and 14 March, 1820. The "Directorium Cleri" of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for 1907 states that there are in Corsica one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and five hundred and ninety-seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, professors, directors, and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. There are one <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, eight titular canons, twenty-nine honorary canons, five archpriests, thirteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the first class, forty-eight of the second class, and three hundred and thirty-three <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. Parochial councils, composed of members of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, assist the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, since the suppression of the former boards of trustees by the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. In Ajaccio there was, until recently, a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, but the students were dispersed on account of the non-acceptance by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> of the so-called "Law of Separation". At the time it ceased to exist, it had thirty-eight students and ten candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Every newly <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is required to present himself yearly for five consecutive years for examination in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> before a special committee. The degrees in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> may dispense from several or all of these examinations, but a young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is never admitted to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> ministry without having passed an examination of this kind. In Corsica there are numerous charitable and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> brotherhoods, founded in the days of Italian rule. Several of these associations assemble in their own <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The churches are usually of the Italian style of architecture and sometimes richly adorned. The Society for the Propagation of the Faith is directed by a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> committee instituted 13 February, 1859. The <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a> has two conferences. An Association for free <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is supported by the subscriptions of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, who also provide for the needs of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship. Before the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders there were in Corsica one house of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, six <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, one <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, and five <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and one house of the Oblates of Mary. These, as well as the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> and all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, have been closed by the Government. There are still six <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. In consequence of the new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Corsica, a poor country, is confronted with a crisis: the people, habituated to look to the State for the support of public worship, must now adopt new methods and make many <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for the maintenance of religion.
