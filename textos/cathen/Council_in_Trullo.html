<h1>Council in Trullo</h1>  

<p>This particular council of Constantinople, held in 692 under Justinian II, is generally known as the Council <em>in Trullo</em>, because it was held in the same domed hall where the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a> had met (see above). Both the Fifth and the Sixth General Councils had omitted to draw up disciplinary canons, and as this council was intended to complete both in this respect, it also took the name of Quinisext (Concilium Quinisextum, <em>Eunodos penthekte</em>), i.e. Fifth-Sixth. It was attended by 215 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, all Orientals. Basil of <a href="../cathen/06654a.htm">Gortyna</a> in <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>, however, belonged to the Roman <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> and called himself <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, though no evidence is extant of his right to use a title that in the East served to clothe the decrees with Roman authority. In fact, the West never recognized the 102 disciplinary canons of this council, in large measure reaffirmations of earlier canons. Most of the new canons exhibit an inimical attitude towards Churches not in disciplinary accord with Constantinople, especially the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Churches</a>. Their customs are <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> and "every little detail of difference is remembered to be condemned" (Fortescue). Canon iii of Constantinople (381) and canon xxviii of Chalcedon (451) are renewed, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Honorius is again condemned (can. i), and marriage with a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is invalid because <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> says it is merely unlawful; <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had recognized fifty of the <a href="../cathen/03279a.htm">Apostolic Canons</a>, therefore the other thirty-five obtain recognition from this council, and as inspired teaching (see <a href="../cathen/03279a.htm">APOSTOLIC CANONS</a>).

<p>In the matter of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> the Greek <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> are not content to let the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> follow its own discipline, but insist on making a rule (for the whole Church) that all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> except <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may continue in wedlock, while they <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> anyone who tries to separate a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> from his wife, and any cleric who leaves his wife because he is <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> (can. iii, vi, xii, xiii, xlviii).

<p>The Eastern Orthodox churches holds this council an ecumenical one, and adds its canons to the decrees of the Fifth and Sixth Councils. in the West <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> calls it (De sexta mundi aetate) a "reprobate" synod, and <a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a> (Hist. Lang., VI, p. 11) an "erratic" one. Dr. Fortescue rightly says (op. cit. below, p. 96) that intolerance of all other customs with the wish to make the whole <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> conform to its own local practices has always been and still is a characteristic note of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>. For the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, substantially identical, in face of the various attempts to obtain their approval of these canons, see Hefele, "Conciliengesch." (III, 345-48).
