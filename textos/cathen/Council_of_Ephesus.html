<h1>Council of Ephesus</h1>  

<p>The third ecumenical council, held in 431.
<h2>The occasion and preparation for the council</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of this great council seems to have been due to Nestorius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople. St. Cyril, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, had accused him to Pope St. Celestine of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had replied on 11 August, 430, by charging St. Cyril to assume his authority and give notice in his name to Nestorius that, unless he recanted within ten days of receiving this ultimatum, he was to consider himself <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and deposed. The summons was served on Nestorius on a Sunday, 30 November, or 7 December, by four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sent by Cyril. But Nestorius was evidently well informed of what he was to expect. He regarded himself as having been <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and he did not choose to be given over into the hands of Cyril. The latter was, in his opinion, not merely a personal enemy, but a dangerous <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, who was reviving to some extent the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">errors of Apollinarius.</a> Nestorius had influence over the Emperor of the East, Theodosius II, whom he induced to summon a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> to judge of the difference between the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> and himself, and he worked so well that the letters of convocation were issued by the emperor to all <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> on 19 November, some days before the messengers of Cyril arrived. The emperor was able to take this course without seeming to favour Nestorius too much, because the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the capital, whom Nestorius had <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for their opposition to his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching, had also appealed to him to call together a council. Nestorius, therefore, paid no attention to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> ultimatum, and refused to be guided by the advice to submit which his friend John, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, volunteered.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was pleased that the whole East should be united to condemn the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He sent two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Arcadius and Projectus, to represent himself and his Roman council, and the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Philip, as his personal representative. Philip, therefore, takes the first place, though, not being a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he could not preside. It was probably a matter of course that the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> should be president. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were directed not to take part in the discussions, but to give judgment on them. It seems that Chalcedon, twenty years later, set the precedent that the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> should always be technically presidents at an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a>, and this was henceforth looked upon as a matter of course, and Greek historians assumed that it must have been the case at Nicaea.

<p>The emperor was anxious for the presence of the most <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of the whole world, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, and sent a special messenger to that great man with a letter in honourable terms. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had died during the siege of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> in the preceding August, though the troubles of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> had prevented news from reaching Constantinople.

<p>Theodosius wrote an angry letter to Cyril, and a temperate one to the council. The tone of the latter epistle and of the instructions given to the imperial commander, Count Candidian, to be absolutely impartial, are ascribed by the Coptic Acts to the influence exercised on the emperor by the Abbot Victor, who had been sent to Constantinople by Cyril to act as his agent at the Court on account of the veneration and friendship which Theodosius was known to feel for the holy man.
<h2>Arrival of the participants at Ephesus</h2>

<p>Nestorius, with sixteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and Cyril, with fifty, arrived before Pentecost at Ephesus. The Coptic tells us that the two parties arrived on the same day, and that in the evening Nestorius proposed that all should join in the Vesper service together. The other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> refused. Memnon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ephesus, was afraid of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and sent his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> only to the church. The mention of a <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, who seems to be the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12007c.htm">Philippi</a>, casts some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on this story, for that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> did not arrive till later. Memnon of Ephesus had forty suffragans present, not counting twelve from Pamphylia (whom <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a> calls <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>). Juvenal of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, with the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom he looked upon as his suffragans, and Flavian of <a href="../cathen/12007c.htm">Philippi</a>, with a contingent from the countries which looked to Thessalonica as their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, arrived soon after Pentecost. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, John, an old friend of Nestorius, wrote to explain that his suffragans had not been able to start till after the Octave of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. (The Coptic Acts say that there was a famine at Antioch.) The journey of thirty days had been lengthened by the death of some horses; he would accomplish the last five or six stages at leisure. But he did not arrive, and it was said that he was loitering because he did not wish to join in condemning Nestorius. Meanwhile the heat was great. Many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were ill. Two or three died. Two of John's <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, those of <a href="../cathen/01592b.htm">Apamea</a> and Hierapolis, arrived and declared that John did not wish the opening of the council to be deferred on account of his delay. However, these two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret of Cyrus</a>, with sixty-five others, wrote a memorial addressed to St. Cyril and Juvenal of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, begging that the arrival of John should be awaited. Count Candidian arrived, with the imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, and he took the same view.


<h2>The council itself</h2>

<p>But Cyril and the majority determined to open the council on 22 June, sixteen days having passed since John had announced his arrival in five or six. It was clear to the majority that this delay was intentional, and they were probably right. Yet it is regrettable that all possible allowance was not made, especially as no news had yet come from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For Cyril had written to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with regard to an important question of procedure. Nestorius had not recanted within the ten days fixed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and he was consequently treated as <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> by the majority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Was he to be allowed a fresh trial, although the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had already condemned him? Or, on the other hand, was he to be merely given the opportunity of explaining or excusing his <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a>? One might have presumed that Pope Celestine, in approving of the council, intended that Nestorius should have a full trial, and in fact this was declared in his letter which was still on the way. But as no reply had come to Cyril, that saint considered that he had no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to treat the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> sentence as a matter for further discussion, and no doubt he had not much wish to do so.
<h3>First session (June 22)</h3>

<p>The council assembled on 22 June, and St. Cyril assumed the presidency both as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> and "as filling the place of the most holy and blessed Archbishop of the Roman Church, Celestine", in order to carry out his original commission, which he considered, in the absence of any reply from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to be still in force.

<p>In the morning 160 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were present, and by evening 198 had assembled. The session began by a justification of the decision to delay no longer. Nestorius had been on the previous day invited to attend. He had replied that he would come if he chose. To a second summons, which was now dispatched, he sent a message from his house, which was surrounded with armed men, that he would appear when all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had come together. Indeed only some twenty of the sixty-eight who had demanded a delay had rallied to Cyril, and Nestorius's own suffragans had also stayed away. To a third summons he gave no answer. This attitude corresponds with his original attitude to the ultimatum sent by Cyril. He would not acknowledge Cyril as a judge, and he looked upon the opening of the council before the arrival of his friends from Antioch as a flagrant <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.

<p>The session proceeded. The <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> was read, and then the second letter of Cyril to Nestorius, on which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Cyril's desire, severally gave their judgment that it was in accordance with the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, 126 speaking in turn. Next the reply of Nestorius was read. All then cried <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">Anathema</a> to Nestorius. Then Pope Celestine's letter to St. Cyril was read, and after it the third letter of Cyril to Nestorius, with the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a> which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> was to accept. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had served this ultimatum on Nestorius deposed that they had given him the letter. He had promised his answer on the morrow, but had not given any, and did not even admit them.

<p>Then two friends of Nestorius, <a href="../cathen/14579a.htm">Theodotus of Ancyra</a> and Acacius of <a href="../cathen/10407a.htm">Mitylene</a>, were invited by Cyril to give an account of their conversations at Ephesus with Nestorius. Acacius said that Nestorius had repeatedly declared <em>dimeniaion e trimeniaion me dein legesthai Theon</em>. Nestorius's own account of this conversation in his "Apology" (Bethune-Baker, p. 71) shows that this phrase is to be translated thus: "We must not say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is two or three months old." This is not so shocking as the meaning which has usually been ascribed to the words in modern as well as ancient times (e.g. by <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, VII, xxxiv): "A baby of two or three months old ought not to be called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." The former sense agrees with the accusation of Acacius that Nestorius declared "one must either deny the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> (<em>theotes</em>) of the Only-begotten to have become man, or else admit the same of the Father and of the Holy Ghost." (Nestorius means that the Divine Nature is numerically one; and if Nestorius really said <em>theotes</em>, and not <em>hypostasis</em>, he was right, and Acacius was wrong.)

<p>Acacius further accused him of uttering the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> that the Son who died is to be distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. A series of extracts from the holy Fathers was then read, Peter I and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, Julius and Felix of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (but these <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> were <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> forgeries), Theophilus, Cyril's uncle, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, Basil, <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a>, Atticus, Amphilochius. After these, contrasted passages from the writings of Nestorius were read. These were of course <em>pi&egrave;ces justificatives</em> brought forward by Cyril, and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to inform the council as to the question at issue. Hefele has wrongly understood that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were examining the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Nestorius afresh, without accepting the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as necessarily correct. A fine letter from Capreolus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of a greater number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> than any of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, was next produced. He writes in the midst of the devastation of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, and naturally could neither hold any synod nor send any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. No discussion followed (and Hefele is wrong in suggesting an omission in the Acts, which are already of extraordinary length for a single day), but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> accepted with acclamation the words of Capreolus against novelty and in praise of ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and all proceeded to sign the sentence against Nestorius. As the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> by St. Celestine was still in force, and as Nestorius had contumaciously refused to answer the threefold summons enjoined by the canons, the sentence was worded as follows:

<blockquote><p>The holy synod said: "Since in addition to the rest the most impious Nestorius has neither been willing to obey our citation, nor to receive the most holy and god-fearing <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom we sent to him, we have necessarily betaken ourselves to the examination of his impieties; and, having apprehended from his letters and from his writings, and from his recent sayings in this <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> which have been reported, that his opinions and teachings are impious, we being necessarily impelled thereto both by the canons [for his <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a>] and by the letter [to Cyril] of our most holy father and colleague Celestine, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, with many tears have arrived at the following grievous sentence against him: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord, Jesus Christ</a>, Who has been blasphemed by him, has defined by this holy synod that the same Nestorius is excluded from all episcopal dignity and from every assembly of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. </p></blockquote>

<p>This sentence received 198 signatures, and some more were afterwards added. A brief notification addressed to "the new <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>" was sent to Nestorius. The Coptic Acts tell us that, as he would not receive it, it was affixed to his door. The whole business had been concluded in a single long session, and it was evening when the result was known. The people of Ephesus, full of rejoicing, escorted the fathers to their houses with torches and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. Count Candidian, on the other hand, had the notices of the deposition torn down, and silenced the cries in the streets. The council wrote at once to the emperor and to the people and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Constantinople, though the Acts had not yet been written out in full. In a letter to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the same city and to the Abbot Dalmatius (the Coptic substitutes Abbot Victor), Cyril asks for their vigilance, as Candidian was sending <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> reports. Sermons were preached by Cyril and his friends, and the people of Ephesus were much excited. Even before this, Nestorius, writing, with ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to the emperor to complain that the council was to begin without waiting for the Antiochenes and the Westerns, had spoken of the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the people, egged on by their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Memnon who (so the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> said) had shut the churches to him and threatened him with death.
<h3>Arrival of John of Antioch (June 27)</h3>

<p>Five days after the first session <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a> arrived. The party of Cyril sent a deputation to meet him honourably, but John was surrounded by soldiers, and complained that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were creating a disturbance. Before he would speak to them, he held an assembly which he designated "the holy synod". Candidian deposed that he had disapproved of the assembling of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> before John's arrival; he had attended the session and read the emperor's letter (of this not a word in the Acts, so Candidian was apparently lying). John accused Memnon of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and Cyril of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Eunomian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. These two were deposed by forty-three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present; the members of the council were to be forgiven, provided they would condemn the twelve <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a> of Cyril. This was absurd, for most of these could not be understood in anything but a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense. But John, who was not a bad man, was in a bad temper. It is noticeable that not a word was said in favour of Nestorius at this assembly. The party of Cyril was now complaining of Count Candidian and his soldiers, as the other side did of Memnon and the populace. Both parties sent their report to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The emperor was much distressed at the division, and wrote that a collective session must be held, and the matter begun afresh. The official named <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> who brought this epistle took back with him many letters from both sides. Cyril proposed that the emperor should send for him and five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to render an exact account.
<h3>Second session (10 July)</h3>

<p>At last on 10 July the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> envoys arrived. The second session assembled in the episcopal residence. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Philip opened the proceedings by saying that the former letter of St. Celestine had been already read, in which he had decided the present question; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had now sent another letter. This was read. It contained a general exhortation to the council, and concluded by saying that the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> had instructions to carry out what the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had formerly decided; doubtless the council would agree. The Fathers then cried:<blockquote><p>This is a just judgment. To Celestine the new Paul! To the new Paul Cyril! To Celestine, the guardian of the Faith! To Celestine agreeing to the Synod! The Synod gives thanks to Cyril. One Celestine, one Cyril! </p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Projectus then says that the letter enjoins on the council, though they need no instruction, to carry into effect the sentence which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had pronounced. Hefele wrongly interprets this: "That is, that all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should accede to the Papal sentence" (vol. III, 136). Firmus, the Exarch of Caesarea in Cappadocia, replies that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, by the letter which he sent to the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, Constantinople, and Antioch, had long since given his sentence and decision; and the synod &#151; the ten days having passed, and also a much longer period &#151; having waited beyond the day of opening fixed by the emperor, had followed the course indicated by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and, as Nestorius did not appear, had executed upon him the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sentence, having inflicted the canonical and Apostolic judgment upon him. This was a reply to Projectus, declaring that what the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> required had been done, and it is an accurate account of the work of the first session and of the sentence; <em>canonical</em> refers to the words of the sentence, "necessarily obliged by the canons", and <em>Apostolic</em> to the words "and by the letter of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>". The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Arcadius expressed his regret for the late arrival of his party, on account of storms, and asked to see the decrees of the council. Philip, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> personal <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, then thanked the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for adhering by their acclamations as holy members to their holy head &#151; "For your blessedness is not unaware that the Apostle Peter is the head of the Faith and of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>." The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> declared that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had shown the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the synod's sentence by the coming of St. Celestine's letter and of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. The session closed with the reading of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letter to the emperor.
<h3>Third session (July 11)</h3>

<p>On the following day, 11 July, the third session took place. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> had read the Acts of the first session and now demanded only that the condemnation of Nestorius should be formally read in their presence. When this had been done, the three <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> severally pronounced a confirmation in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name. The exordium of the speech of Philip is celebrated:<blockquote><p>It is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> to none, nay it has been known to all ages, that holy and blessed Peter, the prince and head of the Apostles, the column of the Faith, the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, received from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Saviour and Redeemer of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, the keys of the Kingdom, and that to him was given the power of binding and loosing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, who until this day and for ever lives and judges in his successors. His successor in order and his representative, our holy and most blessed Pope Celestine. . . </p></blockquote>

<p>It was with words such as these before their eyes that <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and councils spoke of the Council of Ephesus as celebrated "by Celestine and Cyril". A translation of these speeches was read, for Cyril then rose and said that the synod had understood them clearly; and now the Acts of all three sessions must be presented to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> for their signature. Arcadius replied that they were of course willing. The synod ordered that the Acts should be set before them, and they signed them. A letter was sent to the emperor, telling him how St. Celestine had held a synod at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and had sent his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, representing himself and the whole of the West. The whole world has therefore agreed; Theodosius should allow the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to go home, for many suffered from being at Ephesus, and their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> also must suffer. Only a few friends of Nestorius held out against the world's judgment. A new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be appointed for Constantinople.
<h3>Fourth session (July 16)</h3>

<p>On 16 July a more solemn session was held, like the first, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the Theotokos. Cyril and Memnon presented a written protest against the <em>conciliabulum</em> of <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a>. He was cited to appear, but would not even admit the envoys.
<h3>Fifth session (July 17)</h3>

<p>Next day the fifth session was held in the same church. John had set up a placard in the city accusing the synod of the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He is again cited, and this is counted as the third canonical summons. He would pay no attention. In consequence the council suspended and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, together with thirty-four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his party, but refrained from deposing them. Some of John's party had already deserted him, and he had gained only a few. In the letters to the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> which were then dispatched, the synod described itself as now consisting of 210 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The long letter to Celestine give a full account of the council, and mentions that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> decrees against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> had been read and confirmed.
<h3>Sixth session</h3>

<p>At the end of the sixth session, which dealt only with the case of two <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianizing</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, was made the famous declaration that no one must produce or compose any other creed than (<em>para</em>, <em>proeter</em>, "beyond" &#151; "contrary to"?) the Nicene, and that anyone who should propose any such to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who wished to be converted, should be deposed if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or cleric, or <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. This decision became later a fruitful source of objections to the decrees of later <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and to the addition of the <em>filioque</em> to the so-called Constantinopolitan Creed; but that creed itself would be abolished by this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> if it is taken too literally. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of several matters connected with Pamphylia and Thrace which were treated by the council, which are not found in the Acts. <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> tells us that Cyril reported to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the intrigues by which Juvenal of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> tried at Ephesus to carve himself a <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> out of that of Antioch, in which his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> lay. He was to succeed in this twenty years later, at Chalcedon.
<h3>Seventh session (July 31)</h3>

<p>In the seventh and last session on 31 July (it seems) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> persuaded the council to approve their claim of having been anciently and rightly exempt from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Antioch. Six canons were also passed against the adherents and supporters of Nestorius.
<h2>Imperial and papal confirmation of the council</h2>

<p>The history of the intrigues by which both parties tried to get the emperor on their side need not be detailed here. The <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> were triumphant at Ephesus by their numbers and by the agreement of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>. The population of Ephesus was on their side. The people of Constantinople rejoiced at the deposition of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But Count Candidian and his troops were on the side of Nestorius, whose friend, Count <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, was also at Ephesus, working for him. The emperor had always championed Nestorius, but had been somewhat shaken by the reports of the council. Communication with Constantinople was impeded both by the friends of Nestorius there and by Candidian at Ephesus. A letter was taken to Constantinople at last in a hollow cane, by a messenger disguised as a beggar, in which the miserable condition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Ephesus was described, scarce a day passing without a funeral, and entreaty was made that they might be allowed to send representatives to the emperor. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, St. Dalmatius, to whom the letter was addressed, as well as to the emperor, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and people of Constantinople, left his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in obedience to a Divine voice and, at the head of the many thousand <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the city, all chanting and carrying tapers, made his way through enthusiastic crowds to the palace. They passed back right through the city, after the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> Dalmatius had interviewed the emperor, and the letter was read to the people in the church of St. Mocius. All shouted "Anathema to Nestorius!"

<p>Eventually the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and well-meaning emperor arrived at the extraordinary decision that he should ratify the depositions decreed by both councils. He therefore declared that Cyril, Memnon, and John were all deposed. Memnon and Cyril were kept in close confinement. But in spite of all the exertions of the Antiochan party, the representatives of the envoys whom the council was eventually allowed to send, with the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Philip, to the Court, persuaded the emperor to accept the great council as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one. Nestorius anticipated his fate by requesting permission to retire to his former <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The synod was dissolved about the beginning of October, and Cyril arrived amid much <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> on 30 October. St. Celestine was now dead, but his successor, <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">St. Sixtus III</a>, confirmed the council.
