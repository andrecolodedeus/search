<h1>Council of Pisa</h1>  

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">great Schism of the West</a> had lasted thirty years (since 1378), and none of the means employed to bring it to an end had been successful. Compromise or arbitral agreement between the two parties had never been seriously attempted; surrender had failed lamentably owing to the obstinacy of the rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, all equally convinced of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>; action, that is the interference of princes and armies, had been without result. During these deplorable divisions <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> had in turn replaced <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> (Bartholomew Prignano) in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Rome</a>, while <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> had succeeded <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII (Robert of Geneva)</a> in that of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the reigning pontiffs being greatly dissatisfied, both with the pusillanimity and nepotism of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> and the obstinacy and bad will of <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, resolved to make use of a more efficacious means, namely a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. The French king, Charles V, had recommended this, at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> assembled at <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a> and Fondi in revolt against <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, and on his deathbed he had expressed the same wish (1380). It had been upheld by several councils, by the cities of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> and Florence, by the Universities of Oxford and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and by the most renowned <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the time, for example: <a href="../cathen/07236b.htm">Henry of Langenstein</a> ("Epistola pacis", 1379, "Epistola concilii pacis", 1381); Conrad of Gelnhausen ("Epistola Concordi&aelig;", 1380); <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> (Sermo coram Anglicis); and especially the latter's master, Pierre d'Ailly, the eminent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, who wrote of himself: "A principio schismatis materiam concilii generalis primus &hellip; instanter prosequi non timui" (Apologia Concilii Pisani, apud Tschackert). Encouraged by such men, by the known dispositions of King Charles VI and of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, four members of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> went to Leghorn where they arranged an interview with those of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and where they were soon joined by others. The two bodies thus united were resolved to seek the union of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in spite of everything, and thenceforth to adhere to neither of the competitors. On 2 and 5 July, 1408, they addressed to the princes and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> letter summoning them to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> on 25 March, 1409. To oppose this project Benedict convoked a council at Perpignan while <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory</a> assembled another at Aquilea, but those assemblies met with little success, hence to the Council of Pisa were directed all the attention, unrest, and hopes of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world. The Universities of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, and Cologne, many <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, like d'Ailly and <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a>, openly approved the action of the revolted <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The princes on the other hand were divided, but most of them no longer relied on the good will of the rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and were determined to act without them, despite them, and, if needs were, against them.
<h2>Meeting of the Council</h2>

<p>On the <a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">feast of the Annunciation</a>, 4 <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, 22 <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and 80 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> asembled in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> under the presidency of Cardinal de Malesset, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were the representatives of 100 absent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 87 <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> with the proxies of those who could not come to <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, 41 <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> and generals of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, 300 <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> or canon law. The ambassadors of all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> kingdoms completed this august assembly. Judicial procedure began at once. Two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal deacons</a>, two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and two notaries gravely approached the church doors, opened them, and in a loud voice, in the Latin tongue, called upon the rival pontiffs to appear. No one replied. "Has anyone been appointed to represent them?" they added. Again there was silence. The delegates returned to their places and requested that <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory</a> and Benedict be declared guilty of <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a>. On three consecutive days this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was repeated without success, and throughout the month of May testimonies were heard against the claimants, but the formal declaration of <a href="../cathen/04340a.htm">contumacy</a> did not take place until the fourth session. In defence of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory</a>, a German embassy unfavourable to the project of the assembled <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> went to <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (15 April) at the instance of Robert of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, King of the Romans. John, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Riga, brought before the council several excellent objections, but in general the German delegates spoke so blunderingly that they aroused hostile manifestations and were compelled to leave the city as fugitives. The line of conduct adopted by Carlo Malatesta, Prince of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, was more clever. Robert by his awkward friendliness injured <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory's</a> otherwise most defendable cause; but Malatesta defended it as a man of letters, an orator, a politician, and a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>, though he did not attain the desired success. Benedict refused to attend the council in person, but his delegates arrived very late (14 June), and their claims aroused the protests and laughter of the assembly. The people of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> overwhelmed them with threats and insults. The Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> was listened to with little favour, while the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> made a declaration of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> more daring than wise. Intimidated by rough demonstrations, the ambassadors, among them Boniface Ferrer, Prior of the Grande Chartreuse, secretly left the city and returned to their master.

<p>The pretended preponderance of the French delegates has been often attacked, but the French element did not prevail either in numbers, influence, or boldness of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The most remarkable characteristic of the assembly was the unanimity which reigned among the 500 members during the month of June, especially noticeable at the fifteenth general session (5 June, 1409). When the usual formality was completed with the request for a definite condemnation of <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Peter de Luna</a> and Angelo Corrario, the Fathers of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> returned a sentence until then unexampled in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>. All were stirred when the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13799a.htm">Simon de Cramaud</a>, addressed the august meeting: "Benedict XIII and Gregory XII", said he, "are recognised as schismatics, the approvers and makers of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, guilty of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> and violation of solemn promises, and openly <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalising</a> the universal Church. In consequence, they are declared unworthy of the Sovereign Pontificate, and are <em>ipso facto</em> deposed from their functions and dignities, and even driven out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is forbidded to them henceforward to consider themselves to be <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiffs</a>, and all proceedings and promotions made by them are annulled. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is declared vacant and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are set free from their promise of obedience." This grave sentence was greeted with joyful applause, the <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a> was sung, and a solemn procession was ordered next day, the feast of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>. All the members appended their signatures to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the council, and every one thought that the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was ended forever. On 15 June the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> met in the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> to proceed with the election of a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> lasted eleven days. Few obstacles intervened from outside to cause delay. Within the council, it is said, there were intrigues for the election of a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but, through the influence of the energetic and ingenious Cardinal Cossa, on 26 June, 1409, the votes were unanimously cast in the favour of Cardinal Peter Philarghi, who took the name of <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>. His election was expected and desired, as testified by universal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> announced his election to all the sovereigns of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, from whom he received expressions of lively sympathy for himself and for the position of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He presided over the last four sessions of the council, confirmed all the ordinances made by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> after their refusal of obedience to the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a>, united the two sacred colleges, and subsequently declared that he would work energetically for reform.
<h2>Judgment of the Council of Pisa</h2>

<p>The right of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to convene a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> seemed to themselves indisputable. This was a consequence of the natural principle of discovering within itself a means of safety: <em>Salus populi suprema lex esto,</em> i.e., the chief interest is the safety of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the preservation of her indispensable unity. The tergiversations and <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjuries</a> of the two pretenders seemed to justify the united sacred colleges. "Never", said they, "shall we succeed in ending the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> while these two obstinate <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are at the head of the opposing parties. There is no undisputed <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who can summon a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. As the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> must be considered vacant. We have therefore a lawful mandate to elect a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who will be undisputed, and to convoke the universal Church that her adhesion may strengthen our decision". Famous <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> urged and upheld the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in this conclusion. And yet, from the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and judicial point of view, their reasoning might seem <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, dangerous, and revolutionary. For if <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory</a> and Benedict were <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, so were the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> whom they had created. If the fountain of their authority was uncertain, so was their competence to convoke the universal Church and to elect a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Plainly, this is arguing in a circle. How then could <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>, elected by them, have indisputable <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the recognition of the whole of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>? Further, it was to be feared that certain spirits would make use of this temporary expedient to transform it into a general rule, to proclaim the superiority of the sacred college and of the council to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and to legalize henceforth the appeals to a future council, which had already commenced under King <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>. The means used by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> could not succeed even temporarily. The position of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> became still more precarious; instead of two heads there were three wandering <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and exiled from their capitals. Yet, inasmuch as Alexander was not elected in opposition to a generally recognized pontiff, nor by <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> methods, his position was better than that of <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. An almost general opinion asserts that both he and his successor, <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. If the pontiffs of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> had a colourable title in their own obedience, such a title can be made out still more clearly for <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> in the eyes of the universal Church. In fact the Pisan <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was acknowledged by the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, i.e. by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, a few countries of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the County Venaissin, while <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and part of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> continued to obey <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> remained subject to Benedict.

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> and canonists are severe on the Council of Pisa. On the one hand, a violent partisan of Benedict's, Boniface Ferrer, calls it "a conventicle of demons". Theodore Urie, a supporter of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory</a>, seems to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether they gathered at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> with the sentiments of Dathan and Abiron or those of Moses. <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a>, Cajetan, Turrecremata, and Raynald openly call it a conventicle, or at any rate cast <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on its authority. On the other hand, the Gallican <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> either approves of it or pleads extenuating circumstances. No&#235;l Alexander asserts that the council destroyed the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> as far as it could. <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> says in his turn: "If the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> that devastated the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> was not exterminated at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, at any rate it received there a mortal blow and the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> consummated it." <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, faithful to the consequences of their principles, applaud this council unreservedly, for they see in it "the first step to the deliverance of the world", and greet it as the dawn of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> (Gregorovius). Perhaps it is wise to say with <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> that this assembly is a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> which is neither approved nor disapproved. On account of its illegalities and inconsistencies it cannot be quoted as an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a>. And yet it would be unfair to brand it as a conventicle, to compare it with the "robber council" of Ephesus, the pseudo-council of Basle, or the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/12116c.htm">council of Pistoia</a>. This synod is not a pretentious, rebellious, and sacrilegious coterie. The number of the fathers, their quality, authority, intelligence and their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and generous intentions, the almost unanimous accord with which they came to their decisions, the royal support they met with, remove every suspicion of intrigue or cabal. It resembles no other council, and has a place by itself in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>, as unlawful in the manner in which it was convoked, unpractical in its choice of means, not indisputable in its results, and having no claim to represent the Universal Church. It is the original source of all the ecclesiastico-historical events that took place from 1409 to 1414, and opens the way for the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>.
