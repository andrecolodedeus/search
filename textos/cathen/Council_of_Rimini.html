<h1>Council of Rimini</h1>  

<p>The second Formula of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> (357) stated the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05605a.htm">Anomoeans</a>, or extreme <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. Against this the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, assembled at <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, the episcopal city of their leader Basilius, issued a counter formula, asserting that the Son is in all things like the Father, afterwards approved by the Third Synod of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> (358). This formula, though silent on the term <em>"homousios"</em>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, was signed by a few <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and probably by <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a>, being, in fact, capable of an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> interpretation. The Emperor Constantius cherished at that time the hope of restoring peace between the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> by convoking a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. Failing to convene one either at Nicaea or at <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, he was persuaded by Patrophilus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a>, and Narcissus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Neronias, to hold two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, one for the East at <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, in Isauria, the other for the West at <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, a proceeding justified by diversity of language and by expense. Before the convocation of the councils, Ursacius and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> had Marcus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01701d.htm">Arethusa</a>, designated to draft a formula (the Fourth of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>) to be submitted to the two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. It declared that the Son was born of the Father before all ages (agreeing so far with the Third Formula); but it added that when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is spoken of, the word <em>ousia</em>, "essence ', should be avoided, not being found in Scripture and being a cause of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the faithful; by this step they intended to exclude the similarity of essence.

<p>The Council of Rimini was opened early in July, 359, with over four hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. About eighty <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>, including Ursacius, Germinius, and Auxentius, withdrew from the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the most eminent of whom was Restitutus of Carthage; <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, Eusebius, Dionysius, and others were still in exile. The two parties sent separate deputations to the emperor, the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> asserting clearly their firm attachment to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Nicaea, while the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> minority adhered to the imperial formula. But the inexperienced representatives of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> majority allowed themselves to be deceived, and not only entered into communion with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> delegates, but even subscribed, at, Nice in Thrace, a formula to the effect merely that the Son is like the Father according to the Scriptures (the words "in all things" being omitted). On their return to <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, they were met with the unanimous protests of their colleagues. But the threats of the consul Taurus, the remonstrances of the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> against hindering peace between East and West for a word not contained in Scripture, their privations and their homesickness--all combined to weaken the constancy of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. And the last twenty were induced to subscribe when Ursacius had an addition made to the formula of <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>, declaring that the Son is not a creature like other creatures. <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a>, having regained his liberty, rejected this formula, which was thereupon repudiated by many who had signed it. In view of the hasty manner of its adoption and the lack of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, it could have no authority. In any case, the council was a sudden defeat of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> could say: "The whole world groaned in astonishment to find itself <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>".
