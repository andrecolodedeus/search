<h1>Council of Sardica</h1>  

<p>One of the series of councils called to adjust the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and other difficulties caused by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a>, held most probably in 343. (For date see Hefele, French Tr., "Histoire des conciles", II, pt. II, 737-42, and Duchesne, "Hist. ancienne de l'&Eacute;glise", II, 215.) It was convoked by the Emperors Constans and Constantius at the urgent entreaty of Pope Julius. <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius of Cordova</a> and other Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, desirous of peace and hoping to secure a final judgment in the case of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> alternately condemned and vindicated by councils in the East and the West; desirous, also, of settling definitively the confusion arising from the many <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> formul&aelig; in circulation, suggested that all such matters should be referred to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. In order to make the council thoroughly representative, Sardica in Dacia (now Sofia, in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>), was chosen as the meeting place. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, driven from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> by the Prefect Philadrius in 339, was summoned by the Emperor Constans from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he had taken the latter place he met <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius</a>, who was commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor to preside over the council, and whom he accompanied to Sardica. Pope Julius was represented by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> Archidamus and Philoxenus, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Leo. Ninety-six Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> presented themselves at <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>: those from the East were not so numerous.

<p>Being in the minority, the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> decided to act as a body, and, fearing defections, they all lodged in the same place. On the ground of being unwilling to recognize <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="../cathen/09642a.htm">Marcellus of Ancyra</a>, and Asclepas, who had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> in Eastern <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, they refused to sit in council with the Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius of Cordova</a> attempted to effect a compromise by inviting them to present privately to him their complaints against <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, and by promising, in case <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> should be acquitted, to take him to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. These overtures failed. The Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> &#151; although the council had been called expressly for the purpose of reopening the case in regard to those who had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> &#151; defended their conduct on the fictitious plea that one council could not revise the decisions of another. They withdrew from <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> and met at Philippopolis, where they composed an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> and a new creed, which they falsely dated from <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>. The Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, thus abandoned, examined the cases of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, Marcellus, and Asclepas. No fresh investigation of charges against <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> was considered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as these had already been rejected, and he and the other two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were permitted to present exculpatory documents, were declared innocent. In addition to this, censure was passed on the Easterns for having abandoned the council, and several of them were deposed and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p>The question of a new creed containing some additions of that of Nicxa was discussed, but although the foruml&aelig; had been drawn up, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> wisely decided to add nothing to the accepted symbol, and thus gave the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> no pretext for saying that hitherto they had not been explicitly condemned. Though the form of the proposed creed was presented to the council, it was bit inserted in the encyclical addressed by the council to "all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". Before separating, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> enacted several important canons, especially concerning the transfer and trial of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and appeals. These canons, with the other documents of the council, were sent to Pope Julius with a letter signed by the majority of the attending <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The council failed entirely to accomplish its purpose. The pacification of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was not secured, and the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> grew bolder and more contumacious.
