<h1>Council of Trent</h1>  

<p>The nineteenth <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> opened at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> on 13 December, 1545, and closed there on 4 December, 1563. Its main object was the definitive determination of the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in answer to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; a further object was the execution of a thorough reform of the inner life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by removing the numerous abuses that had developed in it.
<h2 id="section1">Convocation and opening</h2>

<p>On 28 November, 1518, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> because he was convinced that he would be condemned at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines. The Diet held at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> in 1523 demanded a "free <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> council" on German soil, and at the Diet held in the same city in 1524 a demand was made for a German national council to regulate temporarily the questions in dispute, and for a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> to settle definitely the accusations against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the religious disputes. Owing to the feeling prevalent in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the demand was very dangerous. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> positively rejected the German national council, but did not absolutely object to holding a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> forbade the national council, but notified <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> through his ambassadors that he considered the calling of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> expedient and proposed the city of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> as the place of assembly. In the years directly succeeding this, the unfortunate dispute between emperor and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> prevented any further negotiations concerning a council. Nothing was done until 1529 when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ambassador, <a href="../cathen/10351b.htm">Pico della Mirandola</a>, declared at the Diet of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was ready to aid the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in the struggle against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, to urge the restoration of peace among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rulers, and to convoke a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> to meet the following summer. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a> and <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> met at Bologna in 1530, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> agreed to call a council, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Lorenzo Campeggio</a>, opposed a council, convinced that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were not honest in demanding it. Still the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, especially the dukes of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, favoured a council as the best means of overcoming the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> from which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was suffering; Charles never wavered in his determination to have the council held as soon as there was a period of general peace in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>.

<p>The matter was also discussed at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, when Campegio again opposed a council, while the emperor declared himself in favour of one provided the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> were willing to restore earlier <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> until the decision of the council. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles's</a> proposition met the approval of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes, who, however, wished the assembly to meet in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The emperor's letters to his ambassadors at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the subject led to the discussion of the matter twice in the congregation of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> appointed especially for German affairs. Although opinions differed, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wrote to the emperor that Charles could promise the convoking of a council with his <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>, provided the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> returned to the obedience of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He proposed an Italian city, preferably <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as the place of assembly. The emperor, however, distrusted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that Clement did not really desire a council. Meantime, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes did not agree to abandon their doctrines. Clement constantly raised difficulties in regard to a council, although Charles, in accord with most of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/05788b.htm">Farnese</a>, <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">del Monte</a>, and Canisio, repeatedly urged upon him the calling of one as the sole means of composing the religious disputes. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes refused to withdraw from the position they had taken up. <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I, of France</a>, sought to frustrate the convoking of the council by making impossible <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>. It was mainly his fault that the council was not held during the reign of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, for on 28 Nov., 1531, it had been unanimously agreed in a consistory that a council should be called. At Bologna in 1532, the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> discussed the question of a council again and decided that it should meet as soon as the approval of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes had been obtained for the plan. Suitable <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Briefs</a> addressed to the rulers were drawn up and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were commissioned to go to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The answer of the French king was unsatisfactory. Both he and <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> avoided a definitive reply, and the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> rejected the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> proposed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>The next <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> (1534-49), as <a href="../cathen/05788b.htm">Cardinal Alessandro Farnese</a>, had always strongly favoured the convening of a council, and had, during the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, urged the calling of one. When, after his election, he first met the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, 17 October, 1534, he spoke of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, and repeated this opinion at the first consistory (13 November). He summoned distinguished <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to discuss the matter with them. Representatives of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> and Ferdinand I also laboured to hasten the council. The majority of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, however, opposed the immediate calling of a council, and it was resolved to notify the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decision to hold a church assembly. <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Nuncios</a> were sent for this purpose to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the German king, Ferdinand. <a href="../cathen/15353b.htm">Vergerio</a>, <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to Ferdinand, was also to apprise the German electors and the most distinguished of the remaining ruling princes personally of the impending proclamation of the council. He executed his commission with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, although he frequently met with reserve and distrust. The selection of the place of meeting was a source of much difficulty, as <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> insisted that the council should meet in an Italian city. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> rulers, meeting at Smalkald in December, 1535, rejected the proposed council. In this they were supported by Kings <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>. At the same time the latter sent assurances to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that he considered the council as very serviceable for the extermination of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, carrying on, as regards the holding of a council, the double intrigue he always pursued in reference to German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The visit of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1536 led to a complete agreement between him and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> concerning the council. On 2 June, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> published the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> calling all <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> to assemble at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> on 23 May, 1537, for a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were sent with an invitation to the council to the emperor, the King of the Romans, the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, while a number of other <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> carried the invitation to the other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> countries. The Netherlander Peter van der Vorst was sent to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to persuade the German ruling princes to take part. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> rulers received the ambassador most ungraciously; at Smalkald they refused the invitation curtly, although in 1530 they had demanded a council. <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> took advantage of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that had broken out between himself and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a> in 1536 to declare the journey of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the council impossible.



<p>Meanwhile preparations were carried on with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The commission of reform, appointed in July, 1536, drew up a report as the basis for the correction of the abuses in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> began preparations for the journey to <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>. The Duke of Mantua now raised objections against the holding of the assembly in his city and made <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> which it was not possible to accept at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The opening of the council, therefore, was put off to 1 November; later it was decided to open it at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> on 1 May, 1538. The course of affairs, however, was continually obstructed by <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> who were to preside at the council went to <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>. Only six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were present. The French king and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> met at <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>, and it was decided to prorogue until <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1539. Soon after this the emperor also desired to postpone the council, as he hoped to restore <a href="../cathen/15132a.htm">religious unity</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by conferences with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. After further unsuccessful negotiations both with <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> the council was indefinitely prorogued at the consistory of 21 May, 1539, to reassemble at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> discretion. When <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> met at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> in September, 1541, the former again raised the question of the council. The emperor now consented that it should meet at <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> would not agree, whereupon the emperor proposed <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Cardinal Contarini</a> suggested <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, but nothing was decided. The emperor and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> were invited later to send the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of their countries to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, so that the question of the council could be discussed by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">college of cardinals</a>. <a href="../cathen/10575a.htm">Morone</a> worked in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> for the council, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> agreed to hold it at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. After further consultations at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> convoked on 22 May, 1542, an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> to meet at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> on 1 Nov. of the same year. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> made <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> attacks on the council, and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> opposed it energetically, not even permitting the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of convocation to be published in his kingdom.

<p>The German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes and King Sigismund of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> consented to the convocation. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, enraged at the neutral position of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that was threatening between himself and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, as well as with the wording of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, wrote a reproachful letter to <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>. Nevertheless, preparations were made for the council at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, by special <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commissioners, and three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were appointed later as conciliary <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. The conduct, however, of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and of the emperor again prevented the opening of the council. A few Italian and German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appeared at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> went to Bologna in March 1543, and to a conference with <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> at Busseto in June, yet matters were not advanced. The strained relations which appeared anew between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor, and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, led to another prorogation (6 July, 1543). After the Peace of Crespy (17 Sept., 1544) a reconciliation was effected between <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> had abandoned his opposition and declared himself in favour of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> as the place of meeting, as did the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a>. On 19 Nov., 1544, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Laetare Hierusalem" was issued, by which the council was again convoked to meet at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> on 15 March, 1545. Cardinals <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Giovanni del Monte</a>, <a href="../cathen/09641a.htm">Marcello Cervini</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Reginald Pole</a> were appointed in February, 1545, as the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> to preside at the council. As in March only a few <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had come to <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, the date of opening had to be deferred again. The <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a>, however, desired a speedy opening, consequently 13 December, 1545, was appointed as the date of the first formal session. This was held in the choir of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> after the first president of the council, <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Cardinal del Monte</a>, had celebrated the Mass of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of convocation and the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> appointing the conciliary <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were read, <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Cardinal del Monte</a> declared the <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> opened, and appointed 7 January as the date of the second session. Besides the three presiding <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> there were present: <a href="../cathen/09519a.htm">Cardinal Madruzzi</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, four <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, twenty-one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, five generals of orders. The council was attended, in addition, by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of the King of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Ferdinand, and by forty-two <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and nine canonists, who had been summoned as consultors.
<h2 id="section2">Order of business</h2>

<p>In the work of accomplishing its great task the council had to contend with many difficulties. The first weeks were occupied mainly with settling the order of business of the assembly. After long discussion it was agreed that the matters to be taken into consideration by the members of the council were to be proposed by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>; after they had been drawn up by a commission of consultors (<em>congregatio theologorum minorum</em>) they were to be discussed thoroughly in preparatory sessions of special congregations of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> for <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> questions, and similar congregations for legal questions (<em>congregatio proelatorum theologorum</em> and <em>congregatio proelatorum canonistarum</em>). Originally the fathers of the council were divided into three congregations for discussion of subjects, but this was soon done away with as too cumbersome. After all the preliminary discussions the matter thus made ready was debated in detail in the general congregation (<em>congregatio generalis</em>) and the final form of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> was settled on. These general congregations were composed of all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, generals of orders, and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> who were entitled to a vote, the proxies of absent members entitled to a vote, and the representatives (<em>oratores</em>) of the secular rulers. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> resulting from such exhaustive debates were then brought forward in the formal sessions and votes were taken upon them. On 18 December the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> laid seventeen articles before the general congregations as regards the order of procedure in the subjects to be discussed. This led to a number of difficulties. The main one was whether <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> questions or the reform of church life should be discussed first. It was finally decided that both subjects should be debated simultaneously. Thus after the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> in the sessions of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> followed a similar <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of those on <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> reform. The question was also raised whether the generals of orders and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were members of the council entitled to a vote. Opinions varied greatly on this point. Still, after long discussion the decision was reached that one vote for the entire order belonged to each general of an order, and that the three <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to represent the entire order were entitled to only one vote.

<p>Violent differences of opinion appeared during the preparatory discussion of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to be laid before the second session determining the title to be given the council; the question was whether there should be added to the title "Holy Council of Trent" (<em>Sacrosancta tridentina synodus</em>) the words "representing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> universal" (<em>universalem ecclesiam reproesentans</em>). According to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06070a.htm">Fiesole</a>, Braccio Martello, a number of the members of the council desired the latter form. However, such a title, although justified in itself, appeared dangerous to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and other members of the council on account of its bearing on the Councils of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and Basle, as it might be taken to express the superiority of the <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Therefore instead of this formula the additional phrase "<em>oecumenica et generalis</em>" was proposed and accepted by nearly all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Only three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who raised the question unsuccessfully several times later persisted in wanting the formula <em>"universalem ecclesiam reproesentans".</em> A further point was in reference to the proxies of absent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, namely, whether these were entitled to a vote or not. Originally the proxies were not allowed a vote; <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> granted to those German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who could not leave their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> on account of religious troubles, and to them alone, representation by proxies. In 1562, when the council met again, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> withdrew this permission. Other regulations were also passed, in regard to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of the members to draw the revenues of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> during the session of the council, and concerning the mode of life of the members. At a later date, during the third period of the council, various modifications were made in these decisions. Thus the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the council, who had grown in the meantime into a large body, were divided into six classes, each of which received a number of drafts of <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> for discussion. Special deputations also were often appointed for special questions. The entire regulation of the debates was a very prudent one, and offered every guarantee for an absolutely objective and exhaustive discussion in all their bearings of the questions brought up for debate. A regular courier service was maintained between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was kept fully informed in regard to the debates of the council.
<h2 id="section3">The work and sessions</h2>
<h3 id="A">First period at Trent</h3>

<p>Among the fathers of the council and the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who had been summoned to <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> were a number of important men. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> who presided at the council were equal to their difficult task; Paceco of <a href="../cathen/08267a.htm">Ja&eacute;n</a>, <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Campeggio</a> of Feltre, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06070a.htm">Fiesole</a> already mentioned were especially conspicuous among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were present at the early sessions. <a href="../cathen/13729c.htm">Girolamo Seripando</a>, General of the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian Hermits</a>, was the most prominent of the heads of the orders; of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, the two learned <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Ambrogio Catarino and <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">Domenico Soto</a>, should be mentioned. After the formal opening session (13 December, 1545), the various questions pertaining to the order of business were debated; neither in the second session (7 January, 1546) nor in the third (4 February, 1546) were any matters touching <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> brought forward. It was only after the third session, when the preliminary questions and the order of business had been essentially settled, that the real work of the council began. The <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor's</a> representative, Francisco de Toledo, did not reach <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> until 15 March, and a further personal representative, Mendoza, arrived on 25 May. The first subject of discussion which was laid before the general congregation by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> on 8 February was the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> as the source of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>. After exhaustive preliminary discussions in the various congregations, two <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> were ready for debate at the fourth session (8 April, 1546), and were adopted by the fathers. In treating the canon of Scripture they declare at the same time that in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is, together with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, the standard of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>; then taking up the text and the use of the sacred Books they declare the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> text for <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> and disputations, although this did not exclude textual emendations. It was also determined that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> should be interpreted according to the unanimous testimony of the Fathers and never misused for <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> purposes. Nothing was decided in regard to the translation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in the vernaculars.

<p>In the meantime earnest discussions concerning the question of church reform had been carried on between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, and a number of items had been suggested by the latter. These had special reference to the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> and its administration, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> and <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, the orders, and the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> wished the discussion of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> questions to be postponed, but the council and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could not agree to that, and the council debated <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> simultaneously with <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>. On 24 May the general congregation took up the discussion of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, its nature, consequences, and cancellation by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. At the same time the question of the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a> of the Virgin was brought forward, but the majority of the members finally decided not to give any definite <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> decision on this point. The reforms debated concerned the establishment of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> professorships, preaching, and episcopal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12785b.htm">residence</a>. In reference to the latter the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Paceco, raised the point whether this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> was of Divine origin, or whether it was merely an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ordinance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> origin, a question which led later to long and violent discussions. In the fifth session (17 June, 1546) the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> with five canons (<a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a>) against the corresponding erroneous doctrines; and the first <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on reform (<em>de reformatione</em>) was also <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. This treats (in two chapters) of professorships of the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>, and of secular learning (<em>artes liberales</em>), of those who preach the Divine word, and of the collectors of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<p>For the following session, which was originally set for 29 July, the matters proposed for general debate were the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> as the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> question and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of residence as regards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as the disciplinary <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>; the treatment of these questions was proposed to the general congregation by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> on 21 June. The <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> brought up for debate one of the fundamental questions which had to be discussed with reference to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of the sixteenth century, and which in itself presented great difficulties. The imperial party sought to block the discussion of the entire matter, some of the fathers were anxious on account of the approaching <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes, and there was fresh dissension between the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. However, the debates on the question were prosecuted with the greatest <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; animated, at times even stormy, discussions took place; the debate of the next general session had to be postponed. No less than sixty-one general congregations and forty-four other congregations were held for the debate of the important subjects of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of residence, before the matters were ready for the final decision. At the sixth regular session on 13 January, 1547, was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the masterly <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> (<em>de justificatione</em>), which consisted of a prooemium or preface and sixteen chapters with thirty-three canons in condemnation of the opposing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on reform of this session was one in five chapters respecting the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of residence of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and of the occupants of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> or offices. These <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> make the sixth session one of the most important and decisive of the entire council.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> proposed to the general congregation as the subject-matter for the following session, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and for the disciplinary question a series of ordinances respecting both the appointment and official activities of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and on <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. When the questions had been debated, in the seventh session (3 March, 1547), a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> with suitable canons was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in general (thirteen canons), on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (fourteen canons), and on <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a> (three canons); a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on reform (in fifteen chapters) was also enacted in regard to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, in particular as to pluralities, <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">visitations</a>, and exemptions, concerning the founding of infirmaries, and as to the legal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Before this session was held the question of the prorogation of the council or its transfer to another city had been discussed. The relations between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a> had grown even more strained; the Smalkaldic War had begun in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; and now an infectious disease broke out in <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, carrying off the general of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and others. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, therefore, in the eighth session (11 March, 1547) proposed the transfer of the council to another city, supporting themselves in this action by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> which had been given them by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> some time before. The majority of the fathers voted to transfer the council to Bologna, and on the following day (12 March) the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> went there. By the ninth session the number of participants had risen to four <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, nine <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, forty-nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, two proxies, two <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, three generals of orders, and fifty <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>.
<h3 id="B">Period at Bologna</h3>

<p>The majority of the fathers of the council went with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> from <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> to Bologna; but fourteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who belonged to the party of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> remained at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> and would not recognize the transfer. The sudden change of place without any special consultation beforehand with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not please <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, who probably foresaw that this would lead to further severe difficulties between himself and the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a>. As a matter of fact <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> was very indignant at the change, and through his ambassador <a href="../cathen/15249a.htm">Vaga</a> protested against it, vigorously urging a return to <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor's</a> defeat of the <a href="../cathen/14058b.htm">Smalkaldic League</a> increased his power. Influential <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> sought to mediate between the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but the negotiations failed. The <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a> protested formally against the transfer to Bologna, and, refusing to permit the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had remained at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> to leave that city, began negotiations again with the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> on his own responsibility. Consequently at the ninth session of the council held at Bologna on 21 April, 1547, the only <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> issued was one proroguing the session. The same action was all that was taken in the tenth session on 2 June, 1547, although there had been exhaustive debates on various subjects in congregations. The tension between the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had increased despite the efforts of Cardinals Sfondrato and <a href="../cathen/09519a.htm">Madruzzo</a>. All negotiations were fruitless. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had remained at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> had held no sessions, but when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> four of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Bologna and four of those at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, the latter said in excuse that they could not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the call. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> had now to expect extreme opposition from the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a>. Therefore, on 13 September, he proclaimed the suspension of the council and commanded the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">del Monte</a> to dismiss the members of the council assembled at Bologna; this was done on 17 September. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where they were to prepare <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> for <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">disciplinary</a> reforms. This closed the first period of the council. On 10 Nov., 1549, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> died.
<h3 id="C">Second period at Trent</h3>

<p>The successor of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> was <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> (1550-55), Giovanni del Monte, first <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the council. He at once began negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a> to reopen the council. On 14 Nov., 1550, he issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quum ad tollenda," in which the reassembling at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> was arranged. As presidents he appointed Cardinal Marcellus Crescentius, Archbishop Sebastian Pighinus of Siponto, and Bishop Aloysius Lipomanni of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> reached <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> on 29 April, 1551, where, besides the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city, fourteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the countries ruled by the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a> were in attendance; several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> came from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where they had been staying, and on 1 May, 1551, the eleventh session was held. In this the resumption of the council was <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decreed</a>, and 1 September was appointed as the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the next session. The <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Eucharist</a> and drafts of further disciplinary <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> were discussed in the congregations of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and also in several general congregations. Among the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> were <a href="../cathen/08747a.htm">Lainez</a> and <a href="../cathen/13402b.htm">Salmeron</a>, who had been sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and Johannes Arza, who represented the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a>. Ambassadors of the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a>, King Ferdinand, and Henry II of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> were present. The King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, however, was unwilling to allow any <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to go to the council. In the twelfth session (1 Sept., 1551) the only decision was the prorogation until 11 October. This was due to the expectation of the arrival of other German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, besides the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> who were already in attendance. The thirteenth session was held on 11 Oct., 1551; it <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a comprehensive <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Eucharist</a> (in eight chapters and eleven canons) and also a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on reform (in eight chapters) in regard to the supervision to be exercised by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and on episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Another <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> deferred until the next session the discussion of four articles concerning the Eucharist, namely, Communion under the two species of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04170b.htm">Communion of children</a>; a safe-conduct was also issued for <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who desired to come to the council. An ambassador of Joachim II of <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a> had already reached <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>.

<p>The presidents laid before the general congregation of 15 October drafts of definitions of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Penance</a> and <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> for discussion. These subjects occupied the congregations of theologians, among whom <a href="../cathen/07036b.htm">Gropper</a>, <a href="../cathen/10719a.htm">Nausea</a>, Tapper, and <a href="../cathen/07300a.htm">Hessels</a> were especially prominent, and also the general congregations during the months of October and November. At the fourteenth session, held on 25 November, the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> contained nine chapters on the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> respecting the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> and three chapters on <a href="../cathen/05716a.htm">extreme unction</a>. To the chapters on penance were added fifteen canons condemning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teachings on this point, and four canons condemning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> to the chapters on <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">unction</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on reform treated the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and various matters respecting <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. In the meantime, ambassadors from several <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes and cities reached <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. They made various demands, as: that the earlier decisions which were contrary to the Augsburg Confession should be recalled; that debates on questions in dispute between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> should be deferred; that the subordination of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> should be <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a>; and other propositions which the council could not accept. Since the close of the last session both the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and the general congregations had been occupied in numerous assemblies with the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, as well as with plans for new reformatory <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a>. At the fifteenth session (25 January, 1552), in order to make some advances to the ambassadors of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, the decisions in regard to the subjects under consideration were postponed and a new safe-conduct, such as they had desired, was drawn up for them. Besides the three <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> and Cardinal Madruzzo, there were present at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> ten <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and fifty-four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, most of them from the countries ruled by the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a>. On account of the treacherous attack made by Maurice of Saxony on <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, the city of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> and the members of the council were placed in danger; consequently, at the sixteenth session (23 April, 1552) a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> suspending the council for two years was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. However, a considerably longer period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> elapsed before it could resume its sessions.
<h3 id="D">Third period at Trent</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> did not live to call the council together again. He was followed by <a href="../cathen/09641a.htm">Marcellus II</a> (1555), a former <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, Marcello Cervino; Marcellus died twenty-two days after his election. His successor, the austere <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> (1555-9), energetically carried out internal reforms both in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and in the other parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but he did not seriously consider reconvening the council. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> (1559-65) announced to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> shortly after his election his <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of reopening the council. Indeed, he had found the right man, his nephew, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">Charles Borromeo</a>, to complete the important work and to bring its decisions into customary usage in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Great difficulties were raised once more on various sides. The Emperor Ferdinand desired the council, but wished it to be held in some German city, and not at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>; moreover he desired it to meet not as a continuation of the earlier assembly but as a new council. The King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> also desired the assembling of a new council, but he did not wish it at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> worked in every way against the assembling of the Council. After long negotiations Ferdinand, the Kings of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> left the matter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On 29 Nov., 1560, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ad ecclesiae regimen," by which the council was ordered to meet again at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1561, was published. Notwithstanding all the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a>, Delfino and <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Commendone</a>, the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> persisted in their opposition. <a href="../cathen/06635a.htm">Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga</a> was appointed president of the council; he was to be assisted by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Stanislaus Hosius</a>, Jacobus Puteus (du Puy), <a href="../cathen/13729c.htm">Hieronymus Seripando</a>, Luigi Simonetta, and Marcus Siticus of Altemps. As the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> made their appearance very slowly, the opening of the council was delayed. Finally on 18 Jan., 1562, the seventeenth session was held; it proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/13007a.htm">revocation</a> of the suspension of the council and appointed the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> for the next session. There were present, besides the four <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, one <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, three <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, eleven <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, forty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, four <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and four generals of orders; in addition thirty-four <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> were in attendance. The ambassadors of the princes were a source of much trouble to the presidents of the council and made demands which were in part impossible. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> continued to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> the assembly. Emperor Ferdinand wished to have the discussion of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> questions deferred.

<p>At the eighteenth session (25 Feb., 1562) the only matters decided were the publication of a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> concerning the drawing up of a list of forbidden books and an agreement as to a safe-conduct for <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. At the next two sessions, the nineteenth on 14 May, and the twentieth on 4 June, 1562, only <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> proroguing the council were issued. The number of members had, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, increased, and various ambassadors of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rulers had arrived at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, but some princes continued to raise obstacles both as to the character of the council and the place of meeting. Emperor Ferdinand sent an exhaustive plan of church reform which contained many articles impossible to accept. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, however, continued the work of the assembly, and presented the draft of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, which treated especially the question of Communion under both species, as well as drafts of several <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">disciplinary</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a>. These questions were subjected to the usual discussions. At the twenty-first session (16 July, 1562) the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on Communion under both species and on the <a href="../cathen/04170b.htm">Communion of children</a> was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in four chapters and four canons. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> upon reformation in nine chapters was also <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>; it treated <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the revenues of canons, the founding of new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and the collectors of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Articles on the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> were now laid before the congregations for discussion; in the following months there were long and animated debates over the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. At the twenty-second session, which was not held until 17 Sept., 1562, four <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>: the first contained the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> (in nine chapters and nine canons); the second directed the suppression of abuses in the offering of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>; a third (in eleven chapters) treated reform, especially in regard to the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the requirements <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> before <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices could be assumed, wills, the administration of religious foundations; the fourth treated the granting of the cup to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> at Communion, which was left to the discretion of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>The council had hardly ever been in as difficult a position as that in which it now found itself. The secular rulers made contradictory and, in part, impossible demands. At the same time warm debates were held by the fathers on the questions of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of residence and the relations of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who arrived on 13 November made several dubious propositions. <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> <a href="../cathen/06635a.htm">Gonzaga</a> and <a href="../cathen/13729c.htm">Seripando</a>, who were of the number of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, died. The two new <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and presidents, <a href="../cathen/10575a.htm">Morone</a> and Navagero, gradually mastered the difficulties. The various points of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were discussed both in the congregations of the eighty-four <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, among whom <a href="../cathen/13402b.htm">Salmeron</a>, <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">Soto</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08747a.htm">Lainez</a> were the most prominent, and in the general congregations. Finally, on 15 July, 1563, the twenty-third session was held. It <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on the Sacrament of Orders and on the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> (in four chapters and eight canons), and a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on reform (in eighteen chapters). This disciplinary <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> treated the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of residence, the conferring of the different grades of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> (seminarists). The decrees which were proclaimed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at this session were the result of long and arduous debates, in which 235 members entitled to a vote took part. Disputes now arose once more as to whether the council should be speedily terminated or should be carried on longer. In the meantime the congregations debated the draft of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Sacrament of Matrimony</a>, and at the twenty-fourth session (11 Nov., 1563) there were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (with twelve canons) on marriage as a <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and a reformatory <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (in ten chapters), which treated the various <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> requisite for contracting of a valid marriage. A general <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on reform (in twenty-one chapters) was also published which treated the various questions connected with the administration of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices.

<p>The desire for the closing of the council grew stronger among all connected with it, and it was decided to close it as speedily as possible. A number of questions had been discussed preliminarily and were now ready for final <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">definition</a>. Consequently in the twenty-fifth and final session, which occupied two days (3-4 December, 1563), the following <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> were approved and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>: on 3 December a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> and invocation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and on the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and images of the same; a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on reform (in twenty-two chapters) concerning <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on reform, treating of the mode of life of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, certificates of fitness for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, <a href="../cathen/09115a.htm">legacies</a> for Masses, the administration of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, the suppression of <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a> among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the life of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in general. On 4 December the following were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>: a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>; a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast days</a>; a further <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on the preparation by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of editions of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, and of a list of forbidden books. It was also declared that no <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> had been placed at a disadvantage by the rank accorded to its ambassadors, and the secular rulers were called upon to accept the decisions of the council and to execute them. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> passed by the council during the pontificates of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> and <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> were read and proclaimed to be binding. After the fathers had agreed to lay the decisions before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for confirmation, the president, Cardinal Morone, declared the council to be closed. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> were subscribed by two hundred and fifteen fathers of the council, consisting of four <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, three <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, twenty-five <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, one hundred and sixty-seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, seven <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, seven generals of orders, and also by nineteen proxies for thirty-three absent <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> were confirmed on 26 Jan., 1564, by <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Benedictus Deus," and were accepted by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, by some with reservations.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">Ecumenical Council</a> of Trent has proved to be of the greatest importance for the development of the inner life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. No council has ever had to accomplish its task under more serious difficulties, none has had so many questions of the greatest importance to decide. The assembly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to the world that notwithstanding repeated <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> in church life there still existed in it an abundance of religious force and of loyal championship of the unchanging principles of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Although unfortunately the council, through no fault of the fathers assembled, was not able to heal the religious differences of western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was clearly proclaimed in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> of the day, and in this way a firm foundation was laid for the overthrow of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and the carrying out of genuine internal reform in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
