<h1>Council of Vienne (1311-12)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Pope Clement V</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Regnans in coelis" of 12 Aug., 1308, called a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> to meet on 1 Oct., 1310, at Vienne in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for the purpose "of making provision in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Order of Knights Templar</a>, both the individual members and its lands, and in regard to other things in reference to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, the Holy Land, and the improvement of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a>". The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was sent to the kings of the respective <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> countries and to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of the various church provinces. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of every church province with two or three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as designated in the individual <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, were to appear in person at the council, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> remaining at home were to transfer their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to their colleagues who had been personally called. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of all kinds were also to bring to the council proposals and motions in writing concerning the points to be improved in church life. A special <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 8 Aug., 1308, directed the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Order of Knights Templar</a> to send suitable <em>defensores</em> to the council, before which the grand master and the other chief officials had been commanded to appear in person. The council, however, could not open at the appointed time, on account of the trials of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> which were begun in the various countries, and the process respecting <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> which <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> had undertaken at the appeal of the French king <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Alma mater" of 4 April, 1310, postponed the opening of the council until 1 Oct., 1311, on account of the investigation of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> that was not yet finished. In September the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> went to Vienne with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and on 16 Oct., 1311, the first formal session of the council was held in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> there. This was the Fifteenth Ecumenical Council. In his opening address the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> again designated the three following points as the main tasks of the council: the matter of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>; the assistance to be given the Holy Land; and the reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> order and of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>.

<p>The Acts of the council have disappeared, with the exception of a fragment which Father Ehrle, S.J., found in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the National Library at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (see below). Consequently there is no positive <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> as to the course of the synod. The number of its members is also variously stated by the authorities. Villiani ("Chron.", IX, XXII, ed. Muratori, "Script", XIII, 454) enumerates 300 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, while other authorities whose testimony is more probable give 114 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to which should be added a number of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and proxies. The best known proceedings of the council are those respecting the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>. A commission was appointed to examine the official records concerning the order, in which commission the various classes of participants in the council and the different countries were represented. From the members of this commission was formed a smaller committee of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> presided over by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, which was to examine exhaustively the official records and the abstracts of these. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> negotiated with the members of this commission respecting the matter. The majority of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and nearly all the members of the commission were of the opinion that the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Order of Knights Templar</a> should be granted the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to defend itself, and that no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> collected up to then was sufficient to condemn the order of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of which it was accused without straining the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. As early as the beginning of December, 1311, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and commission had voted to this effect. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was in a difficult position, on account of the insistence of the powerful French king. In February, 1312, the king himself appeared with a great retinue before the gates of the city of Vienne, and vehemently demanded the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> in a letter of 2 March, addressed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Clement now adopted the expedient of suppressing the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Order of Knights Templar</a>, not be legal method (<em>de jure</em>), but on the plea of solicitude for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and by Apostolic ordinance (<em>per modum provisionis sen ordinationis apostolicae</em>). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> announced this decision in an assembly of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, on 22 March, 1312. On 3 April the second formal session of the council was held; the French king and his three sons were present, and the decision respecting the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Suppression "Vox clamantis" is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 March, 1312. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had retained for himself the decision as to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and the lands of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>; two further <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> were issued to cover these points on 2 and 6 May. During the council, apparently at this second session, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> was declared to have been a lawful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and absolved from the accusations brought against him. Nevertheless, an earlier <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> issued by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> was renewed, whereby the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was absolved from all responsibility for what he had done against <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The synod also took up the question of the Holy Land. In the third formal session, held 6 May, a letter from the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was read aloud, in which he promised to take the cross, together with his sons and large numbers of the nobility, and to begin the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> within six years. If he should die before this time his eldest son would undertake the expedition. Upon this, it was decided to lay a church <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> for six years for this purpose, which was to be raised throughout <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> for the Holy Land. Concerning the raising of this <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>, cf. Kirsch, "Die papstlichen Killektorien in Deutschland" (Paderborn, 1894), 18. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the revenues drawn from the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> for six years were given to the king, who used the money for the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> never took place, although both the Kings of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a> had agreed to it at the council.

<p>As already mentioned, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were directed before the meeting of the council to bring with them written suggestions as to the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> renewed this demand at the opening of the council. Only three of the proposals sent in are known up to now, namely the treatise of William Durandus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10180a.htm">Mende</a>, on the holding of the council ("De modo celebrandi generalis concilii"), that of Major, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a> [in "Collection des documents inedits sur l'hist. de France. Melanges historiques"; II (1877), 471 sqq.], and that of James Dueze, later <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> [published by Verlaque, "Jean XXII" (Paris, 1883), 522 sqq.]. This material was divided into two parts for discussion by the council: improvement of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and protection of the independence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The countless complaints, opinions, and suggestions that were handed in by <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> as well as by secular nobles were systematically arranged and treated. Still it is not known what decrees on these questions resulted from the discussions of the council itself and were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in the third and last session. All that is certain is that a number of decrees on these subjects were proclaimed. These were issued later on 25 October, 1317, by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, together with other decrees of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, which the latter had been prevented by death from <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a>. John published them as the collection of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Clementines, "Corpus Juris Canonici". The decrees passed at the council which are found in this collection refer to the disputes concerning the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Spirituals (condemnation of the three propositions attributed to Petrus Johannes Olivi), the dispute about poverty among the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicants</a>, the visitation of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines</a>, the observance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> hours, administration of religious foundations, matters relating to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, the founding of professorships for the Oriental languages at the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and at the four chief <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, the management of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, and various ordinances respecting the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The council closed with the third formal session, 6 May, 1312.
