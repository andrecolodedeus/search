<h1>Councils of Attigny</h1>  

<p>In 765, <a href="../cathen/03729b.htm">St. Chrodegang</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and thirty-seven other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> mutually promised in an assembly held at the royal residence of Attigny near Vouziers (Ardennes) that after the death of each the survivors would cause the psalter to be said one hundred times and would have one hundred Masses celebrated for the repose of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the departed. Each one would also say thirty Masses for the same intention. In 785, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> held a council at Attigny. Widukind and Aboin, two conquered Saxon kings, presented themselves for instruction and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. In 822, Pope Paschal I was present at a Council of Attigny, convened for the reconciliation of the emperor Louis the Pious with his three younger brothers, Hugo, Drogo, and Theodoric, whom he had caused to be <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> tortured and whom he had intended to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. In the council he confessed publically his wrong-doing; also the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> practiced by him on his nephew, Bernard, King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and his brother, the Abbot, Adelard Wala, and proposed to perform public penance in imitation of the emperor <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius I</a>. He also exhibited an earnest desire to correct abuses arising from the negligence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the nobles and confirmed the rule (<em>Aquensis Regula</em>) that the Council of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> had drawn up (816) for canons and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In 870, thirty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and six <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> met at Attigny, to pass Judgment on Karlmann, the king's son, made an ecclesiastic at an early age, and accused by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> of conspiring against his life and throne. He was deprived of his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Senlis. In the council of 875, <a href="../cathen/07357a.htm">Hincmar, Bishop of Laon</a>, appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from his uncle, <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims</a>.
