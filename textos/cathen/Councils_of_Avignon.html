<h1>Councils of Avignon</h1>  

<p>Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of the council held <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">here</a> in 1060. In 1080 a council was held under the presidency of Hugues de Di&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, in which Achard, usurper of the See of Arles, was deposed, and Gibelin put in his place. Three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> elect (Lautelin of Embrun, Hugues of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, Didier of Cavaillon) accompanied the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> there by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a>. In the year 1209 the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by a Council of Avignon (two <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, four <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and twenty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>) for failing to expel the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian heretics</a> from their city. The Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> was forbidden, under threat of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, to impose exorbitant burdens on his subjects and, as he persisted, was finally <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. In the Council of 1270, presided over by Bertrand de Malferrat, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles, the usurpers of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> were severely threatened; unclaimed legacies were allotted to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> uses; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were urged to mutual support; the individual churches were taxed for the support of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>; and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were forbidden to convoke the civil courts against their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The Council of 1279 was concerned with the protection of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, privileges, and <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Provision was made also for the protection of those who had promised to join the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> ordered by <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, but had failed to go. It was also decreed that to hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, besides the permission of his ordinary or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> must also have that of his superior. In the Council of 1282 ten canons were published, among them one urging the people to frequent more regularly the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> churches, and to be present in their own <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches at least on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast days. The temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> occupied the attention of the Council of 1327. The seventy-nine canons of the Council of 1337 are renewed from earlier councils, and emphasize the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Communion in one's own <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, and of abstinence on Saturday for <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, a practice begun three centuries earlier on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/15068a.htm">Truce of God</a>, but no longer universal. The Council of 1457 was held by Cardinal de Foix, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>. His principal purpose was to promote the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Immaculate Conception, in the sense of the declaration of the Council of Basle. It was forbidden to preach the contrary <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Sixty-four disciplinary decrees were also published, in keeping with the legislation of other councils. A similar number of decrees were published in 1497 by a council presided over by the Archbishop Francesco Tarpugi (afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>). The sponsors of the newly confirmed, it was decreed, were not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make presents to them or to their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Before the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> two candles were to be kept lighted at all times. Disciplinary measures occupied the attention of the Council of 1509. The Council of 1596 was called for the purpose of furthering the observance of the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1545-63), and for a similar purpose the Council of 1609. The Councils of 1664 and 1725 formulated disciplinary decrees; the latter proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of adhering to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> against the "Reflexions morales" of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>. The Council of 1849 published, in ten chapters, a number of decrees concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and discipline.
