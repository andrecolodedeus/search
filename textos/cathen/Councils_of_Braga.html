<h1>Councils of Braga</h1>  

<p>Many councils were held in <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>, some of them important. The authenticity of the so-called council of 411 is very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. It was probably invented by Father Bernardo Brito. It the council of 563 eight <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> took part, and twenty-two decrees were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, among others the following: that in the services of the church the same rite should be followed by all, and that on vigils and in solemn Masses the same lessons should be said by all; that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should salute the people with <em>Dominus vobiscum</em>, as in the Book of Ruth, the response being <em>Et cum spiritu tuo</em>, as was the custom in the East, without the alterations introduced by the Priscillianists; that Mass should be sail according to the <em>ordo</em> sent from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to Profuturus; that the form used for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the Metropolitan See of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> should not be altered; that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should take rank after the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should not ordain candidates from other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> without dimissorial letters from their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; that nothing should be sung in the church but the Psalms and parts of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; that all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who abstained from eating meat should be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to eat vegetables cooked in meat, to avoid all suspicion of the taint of Priscillianism, and that if they refused they should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>; that <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicides</a> and <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> should not be buried with great <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, nor should anyone be buried inside the church; that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should be appointed for the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>.

<p>The second council held in 572, presided over by the aforesaid St. Martin, was held to increase the number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in Galicia. Twelve <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assisted at this council, and ten decrees were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>: (1) that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should in their visitations see in what manner the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> celebrated the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> and administered <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, thanking <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> if they found everything as it should be, and instructing the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> if they were found wanting in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> all <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> to attend instructions for twenty days before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and to learn the creed; (2) that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must not be tyrannical towards his priests; (3-4) that no fee must be accepted for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">holy chrism</a> must be distributed free; (5-6) that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must not ask a fee for consecrating a church, that no church should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being sure of the endowment of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and that no church built on private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> for the purpose of emolument should receive <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; (8) that if a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> should accuse any one of unchastity without the evidence of two or three witnesses he should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>; (9) that the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> should announce the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and have it made known to the people after <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, so that they might be prepared for the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, when <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> were to be recited for three days; on the third day the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten fast</a> should be announced after the Mass; (10) that any one saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> without <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, as many did, as a result of Priscillianist tendencies, should be deprived of his office. This council was attended by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>, and by those of the <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Diocese of Lugo</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> removed all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to its authenticity.

<p>The Third Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> was held in 675, during the primacy of Leodegisius, and in the reign of King Wamba. Eight decrees were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> at this council; (1) that no one should dare to offer in sacrifice milk and grapes, but <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> mixed with a drop of water in a <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, nor should bread soaking in wine be used; (2) that <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> deprived of their office, if either put the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> to profane uses; (4) that no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should have any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> but his mother in his house; (5-6) that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, when carrying the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in procession, must walk to the church, and not be carried in a chair, or litter, by <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> clothed in white; that corporal punishment was not to be inflicted on youthful <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, except for grevious faults; (7-8) that no fee must be accepted for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and that the rectors of the churches must not require that members of their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> household to do work on their private farms; if they did so they must recompense the church for the injury done thereby. There were other councils in 1278-80, 1301, 1328, 1436, 1488, 1537, besides various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> of lesser importance.
