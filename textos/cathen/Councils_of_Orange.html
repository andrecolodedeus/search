<h1>Councils of Orange</h1>  

<p>Two councils were held at Orange (Arausio), a town in the present department of Vaucluse in southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The first met on 8 November, 441, in the church called "Ecclesia Justinianensis" or "Justianensis". The council is designated either by the name of the church, "synodus Justinianensis", or by that of the episcopal city, "Arausicana la" (first of Orange). <a href="../cathen/07349a.htm">St. Hilary of Arles</a> presided, as the diocese formed part of his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> district. Among the other sixteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present was <a href="../cathen/05595a.htm">St. Eucherius</a> who, as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, signed the acts in the name of all his suffragans. The council, as appears from its twenty-ninth canon, was held in obedience to an ordinance of the Synod of Riez (439) prescribing semi-annual <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>, The thirty canons which it issued have occasioned considerable controversy. Their subject-matter was: the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (canons i-iv, xii-xvii), the right of sanctuary (v-vi), mutual episcopal relations (viii-xi), <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> (xviii-xx), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (xxi, xxx), the marriage of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> (xxii-xxv), <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> (xxvi), <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a> and virginity (xxvii-xxviii), the holding of councils (xxix). To these genuine canons Gratian and others added unauthentic ordinances printed in the "Corpus Juris canonici" and reproduced by Mansi in his collection of councils (VI, 441-3).

<p>Much more important was the second council (held on 3 July, 529), the first in Gaul to publish a decision in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The occasion was the dedication of a church built at Orange by Liberius, the pretorian prefect of Narbonensian Gaul. It was attended by fourteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with St. C&aelig;sarius of Arles as president, and its deliberations bore on the current <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of grace and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, i.e. Semipelagianism. C&aelig;sarius had informed <a href="../cathen/06031a.htm">Felix IV (III)</a> of the pernicious activity of the Semipelagians in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and had applied to him for support. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in response, sent him a series of "Capitula", i.e. propositions or decrees drawn almost in their entirety from the works of St. Augustine and the "Sententi&aelig;" of <a href="../cathen/12487a.htm">St. Prosper of Aquitaine</a>. These "Capitula" became the basis of the twenty-five issued by the Synod of Orange, and these in turn were freely used by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in its condemnation of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. The acts of the Synod of Orange contain, after a preamble: <ul><li>(a) eight canons or <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a>; <li>(b) seventeen merely declaratory propositions (both of these classes are known as "Capitula"); <li>(c) a sort of demonstration of the <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> against the objections of the Semipelagians.</ul>

<p>The subjects of the "Capitula" are thus <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> grouped by Portali&eacute; in "Dict. Th&eacute;ol. Cath." (I, 2526). <ul><li>(1) Causes of the necessity of grace. They are: <ul><li>(a) <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> which cannot be wiped out without it (can. ii); <li>(b) the weakness of the will resulting from the fall of man (i); <li>(c) the very condition of creature (xix).</ul> <li>(2) Operation of grace before justification. It precedes every effort conducive to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. From it proceed: <ul><li>(a) <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (can. iii); <li>(b) the desire of justification (iv); <li>(c) the inception of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (v); <li>(d) every effort towards <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (vi); <li>(e) every salutary act (vii); <li>(f) every preparation to justification (viii, xii); <li>(g) all merit (xviii).</ul> <li>(3) Operation of grace in initial justification or <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. It restores (xiii), justifies (xiv), improves (xv), confers the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of Christ (xxviii). <li>(4) Work of grace after justification in the just. It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for good actions (ix); perseverance (x); the taking of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> (xi); <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">Christian fortitude</a> (xvii); the life of Christ within us (xxiv); the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (xxv). <li>(5) Universal necessity of grace. This need of grace to do good and avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is expressed in propositions ix, xx, and the variously interpreted proposition xxii.</ul>

<p>In the demonstration which follows the "Capitula" the fathers also reject the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and declare <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> within the reach of all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The acts of the council, which were signed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the pretorian prefect Liberius and seven other distinguished <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, were forwarded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and approved by <a href="../cathen/02660a.htm">Boniface II</a> on 25 January, 531 (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/02660a.htm">BONIFACE II</a>). They consequently enjoy &oelig;cumenical authority and are printed in <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger's</a> "Enchiridion Symbolorum" (10th ed., nos. 174-200).
