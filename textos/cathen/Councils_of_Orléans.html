<h1>Councils of Orl&eacute;ans</h1>  

<p>Six national councils were held at Orl&eacute;ans in the Merovingian period.

<p>I. &mdash; At the first, convoked by <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> (511), three-three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assisted and passed thirty-one decrees on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, the right of sanctuary, and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. These decrees, equally applicable to <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> and Romans, first established equality between conquerors and conquered. The council claimed the right of sanctuary in favour of churches and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> residences; it stipulated that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> need not produce the culprit, if the pursuer would not swear on the Gospels to do him no injury. It settled the conditions of freedom for a slave upon whom <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> had been conferred; ruled that freemen should not be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> without the kings consent or authorization of the judge; determined the <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> and committed to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the welfare of the sick and the poor; settled relations of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> with their <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The practice of divination was forbidden. <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> approved the decrees of the council, which thus appears as the first treaty between the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> State and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>II. &mdash; The second national council, held under Childebert (June, 533), attended by twenty-five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, decreed that, conformably to the earnest desire of Pope Hormisdas, annual provincial councils should be held; further, that marriage could not be dissolved by will of the contracting parties for infirmities consequent on the contract; forbade the marriage of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> those who partook in flesh offered in sacrifice to idols.

<p>III. &mdash; The third national council (May 538) attended by thirteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, determined the impediments of marriage; pronounced <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in the higher orders who lived incontinently; decreed that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> should be elected by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province, with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and citizens; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the people of the city.

<p>IV. &mdash; The fourth national council (541) assembled thirty-eight <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and maintained the date fixed by Pope Victor for <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, contrary to Justinian's ordinances, and ordered those who had or wished to have a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church on their lands to take the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> measures for the dignity of Divine worship. Finally it perfected the measures taken by the Council of 511 relative to the emancipation of slaves; slaves emancipated by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were to retain their freedom after the death of their emancipators, even though other acts of their administration were recalled; it authorized the final ransom of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had fallen into the power of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> but had invoked the right of sanctuary to recover their freedom; in declared that <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who exhorted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> slaves to become <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in order to be set free should be forbidden to own such slaves.

<p>V. &mdash; The fifth national council (October, 549) assembled nine <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and forty-one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. After defending Mark, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, from attacks made upon him, it pronounced an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Nestorius and <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, it prohibited <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, prescribed that the election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> take place in all freedom, with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the people, and the king, and that no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> until he had been one year in the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It censured all who attempted to subject to any servitude whatsoever slaves who had been emancipated within the church, and those who dared take, retain, or dispose of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. It threatened with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> all who embezzled or appropriated funds given by King Childebert for the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and it placed <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> under the special charge of each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>VI. &mdash; The sixth national council, held under Clovis II about 638 or 629, at the request of Sts. Eloi and Ouen, condemned and expelled from the kingdom a Greek partisan of <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>, at the request of Salvius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>. VII. &mdash; The seventh national council, held in 1022 under Bishop Odolric, proceeded against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> and their few adherents in the city. In September, 1478, Louis XI held at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> a fruitless assembly of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and nobility to discuss the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>, the necessity for a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, and the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">"pragmatic sanction"</a>.
