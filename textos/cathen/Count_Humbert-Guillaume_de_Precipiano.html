<h1>Count Humbert-Guillaume de Precipiano</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, 1626; died at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 7 June, 1711. Having studied the classics at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, philosophy in his native town, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, he graduated as Licenciate in Law and Doctor of Theology at the University of D&ocirc;le. He was named successively canon, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, and dean of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>; commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bellevaux in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; and was then appointed <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> councillor at the Court of D&ocirc;le by Philip IV of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, La Franche-Comt&eacute; being a Spanish dependency. In 1667 Philip sent him to the imperial Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> as plenipotentiary for <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. After 1672 he resided at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> as chief councillor for the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Ten years later he was raised to the <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">See of Bruges</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 21 March, 1683. For seven years he laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> to maintain the purity of the Faith and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to check the spread of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. In 1690 he was offered the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, which he accepted only upon the express order of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. At <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> his life was a constant struggle against the doctrines which were being actively disseminated by the French refugees, Arnauld, <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, and others (see <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">JANSENIUS AND JANSENISM</a>). In union with his suffragans, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> began by insisting on the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> formulated by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> condition for admission to <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> positions. Three episcopal assemblies held under his presidency at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1691, 1692, and 1697, confirmed this regulation. The second (1692) moreover, to prevent all subterfuges regarding the distinction of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and fact, had made certain additions to the formulary. Through Dr. Hennebel, the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> lodged a protest at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and succeeded in having their claim upheld by <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered the adoption of the precise words of the Alexandrine <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> as being quite sufficient since it condemned the five propositions "in the obvious sense which the words of the propositions express, and which our predecessors condemned". Thereupon, men of bad <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> declared that the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> it imposed had been changed, and that it was no longer <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to reject the propositions "in sensu auctoris". The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> communicated with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain a more drastic and efficacious remedy; and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, now better informed, authorized them to proceed, not only in virtue of their own authority but also as delegates of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, against all who by word or writing opposed the well-known decisions of the sovereign authority. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> at once censured and prohibited seventy-one defamatory pamphlets of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> origin; but, as the propaganda in favour of the "Augustinus" continued and moral suasion <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> entirely ineffectual, he sought the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, Gerberon, and Brigode, the distributor of their writings, were arrested at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, by order of Philip V, and confined to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace (1703). <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> escaped to <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, but his vast correspondence was seized and judicial proceedings against him begun. All the documents connected therewith were published under the title "Causa Quesneliana" (Brussels, 1705). They form one of the most valuable sources of the authentic history of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. In 1705, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> was one of the first to publish in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Vineam Domini Sabbaoth", in which <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> condemned the theory of respectful silence (see <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">JANSENIUS AND JANSENISM</a>), and his action elicited the congratulations of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>. At <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> as at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, Precipiano had to fight in defence of the right of asylum attached to certain places or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> his efforts were at first completely thwarted by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. As a last resort he was forced to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> the procurator-general and the members of the <em>Grand Conseil;</em> the magistrates replied by imposing on him an enormous fine, and the heavy penalty of "aqu&aelig; et ignis interdictio". Through the personal intervention of Philip V, who esteemed the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> highly, the quarrel was ended without encroachment on the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or dishonour to their doughty champion.
