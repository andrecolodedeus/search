<h1>Count Louis de Buade Frontenac</h1>  

<p>A governor of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1622; d. at Quebec, 28 Nov., 1698. His father was captain of the royal castle of St-Germain-en-laye; his mother, <em>n&eacute;e</em> Phelypeaux, was the daughter of the king's secretary of state; Louis XIII was his godfather. By his valour and skill he won the rank of marshall of the king's camps and armies. He served in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and also in Candia where Turenne had sent him to command a contingent against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. A brilliant military reputation, therefore, preceeded him to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. During his first administration (1672-1682) he built a fort at Cataracouy (now <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a>) to awe the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> and facilitate communications with the West. To explore the course of the Mississippi, previously discovered by Joliet and Marquette, he sent Cavelier de La Salle, who named the country watered by that river Louisiana, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. Although intelligent and magnanimous, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> and unflinching in peril, he was proud, imperious, and ready to sacrifice all to personal animosity. He quarrelled with most of the officials of the colony over petty questions: with his councillors, with the intendant (Duchesneau), with the Governor of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (Perrot), and with Mgr de Laval, whose prohibition of the liquor-traffic with the Indians he judged harmful to commercial interests. The king, after vainly trying to curb his haughtiness, recalled him in 1682.

<p>In 1689, when the uprising of the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> and the Lachine massacre, in retaliation of <a href="../cathen/04732a.htm">Governor Denonville's</a> treacherous dealing, threatened the existence of the colony, Frontenac was sent to the rescue and was hailed as a deliverer. He had to fight the allied <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> and English; but his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> and ability were equal to the task. After d'Iberville's brilliant exploits in Hudson Bay, Frontenac divided his forces into three corps, which captured Corlar (Schenectady), Salmon Falls (N.H.) and Casco (Me.). When, to avenge these disasters, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> sent a fleet against Quebec (1690), Frontenac's response to the summons of Phipps's envoy was: "Go tell your master that we shall answer him by the mouths of our guns" &mdash; a threat which was made good by the enemy's defeat. In 1696 Frontenac wisely disregarded the instructions of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to evacuate the upper country, which would have ruined the colony, and merely observed a defensive attitude. He dealt the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> power a severe blow, burned the villages of the Onnontagu&eacute;s and Onneyouts, and devastated their country. By his orders d'Iberville razed Fort Pemquid in <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadia</a>, captured St. John's, <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, and nearly the entire island, and took possession of all Hudson Bay Territory. Frontenac died sincerely regretted by the whole colony which he had saved from ruin. His character was a mixture of good and bad qualities. The latter were less evident during his second administration and his talents rendered eminent services. He found <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> weakened and attacked on all sides; he left it in peace, enlarged, and respected. He has been justly called "saver of the country". In spite of his <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and prejudices against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and even the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, he possessed a rich fund of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. He was a faithful friend of the Recollects, and was buried in their church.
