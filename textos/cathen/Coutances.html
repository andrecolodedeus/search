<h1>Coutances</h1>  

<h2>Diocese of Coutances (Constantiensis)</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Coutances comprises the entire department of La Manche and is a suffragan of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. It was enlarged in 1802 by the addition of the former Diocese of Avranches and of two archdeaconries from the <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Diocese of Bayeux</a>; since 1854 its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have held the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Countances and Avranches.
<h2>The diocese of Coutances</h2>

<p>The catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Coutances, as it was made out about the end of the eleventh century, gives as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> St. Ereptiolus and St. Exuperatus (fourth century). Leontianus, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> historically known, attended the Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 511. Coutances counted among its <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> Saint L&ocirc; (Lautro), prominent in the great councils of the middle of the sixth century; St. Rumpharius, apostle of Barfleur (d. about 586); St. Fr&eacute;mond (Frodemundus), who, assisted by Thierry III, founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and a church in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> in 679 at Ham, near Valognes; Blessed Geoffroy de Monthray (1049-1093), friend of William the Conqueror, whose episcopate was signalized by the building of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Coutances, to which purpose he devoted large sums of money that he had gathered in Apulia, and also by the founding of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbeys of Lessay, Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte, and Montebourg, and of the <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> of Cherbourg; Hugues de Morville (1202-1238), organizer of charities in the diocese and founder in 1209 of the celebrated H&ocirc;tel-Dieu of Coutances; Philibert de Montjeu (1424-1439), who presided over the deputation of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> sent by the Council of Basle to the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> and Moravians in order to reconcile them to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and Giuliano della Rovere (1476-1478), afterwards <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. The account book of Thomas Marest, cur&eacute; of Saint-Nicolas of Coutances (1397-1433) is very interesting for the history of social life during the Hundred Years' War. The <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> took possession of the city in 1562, but were banished in 1575. Through the efforts of the venerable P&#232;re Eudes the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Coutances was the first church in the world to have an altar dedicated to the Sacred Heart.
<h2>The diocese of Avranches</h2>

<p>Nepos, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> known to history, assisted at the Council of Orl&eacute;ans in 511. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Avranches included: St. Pair, or Paternus (d. 565), a great founder of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, notably that of Sessiacum, near Granville, which took the name of Saint-Pair; St. Leodovaldus (second half of sixth century); St. Ragertrannus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Jumi&#232;ges (about 682); St. Aubert, who in 708 founded the Abbey of Mont Saint-Michel; Robert Ceneau (1533-1569), author of numerous works against the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>; and Pierre-Daniel Huet (1689-1699), a celebrated savant who assisted <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> the son of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and directed the publication of the Delphin edition of the classics. Between 865 and 990, in the troubled period caused by the victories of the Bretons and the incursions of the Normans, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> were titulars of the See of Avranches. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Avranches were at the same time barons of Avranches, barons of Saint-Philbert-sur-Rilles, and proprietors of numerous domains in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and Jersey. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Avranches, in which <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> taught and Anselm studied, was famous in the eleventh century. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> where, in September, 1171, Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> before the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> that he was entirely innocent of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas Becket</a> was a beautiful monument of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. It collapsed during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/10551a.htm">M<font size=-2>ONT</font>-S<font size=-2>T</font>-M<font size=-2>ICHEL</font></a>.)

<p>The Diocese of Coutances and Avranches honours in a special way St. Pientia (Pience), <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in the third century for having facilitated the burial of St. Nicasius, the apostle of Vexin, and conspicuously <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the liturgy of Avranches; St. Floxel, born in the district of Cotentin, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at the beginning of the fourth century; St. Scubilio, companion of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> St. Pair, and founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mandane on Mont Tombe (subsequently Mont Saint-Michel); Sts. S&eacute;nier, Gaud, and Fragaise, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Sessiacum; <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, who, in the fifth century, evangelized the Saxon colonies of the district of Bessin; St. Severus, the shepherd (sixth century), who was perhaps <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avranches; the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> St. Marcouf (sixth century), founder of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> called after him, and whose name is borne by an island to which he retired each <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> for extraordinary <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>; St. H&eacute;lier, disciple of St. Marcouf, beheaded in a grotto at Jersey; St. Ortaire, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Landelles (end of sixth century); St. Paternus of Coutances, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at Sessiacum, then at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> and finally assassinated (eighth century); St. Leo of Carentan, born about 810, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Louis the Debonair and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> St. Clair (ninth century); St. Guillaume Firmat (eleventh century), <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, pilgrim to the Orient, and patron of the collegiate church of Mortain; Blessed Thomas H&eacute;lie of Biville, <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to St. Louis (thirteenth century); Julie Postel, known in religion as S&aelig;ur Marie-Madeleine (1756-1846), a native of Barfleur, declared Venerable in 1897.

<p>Many men worthy of mention in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> were natives of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>: Alexandre de Villedieu (thirteenth century), canon of Avranches and author of a Latin grammar universally studied during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; the learned but visionary Guillaume Postel (d. 1581), professor of mathematics and Oriental languages in the Coll&#232;ge de France; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a> Feuardent (1539-1610), prominent in the Wars of the League; Cardinal du Perron (1556-1618), who converted Henry IV; the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> publicist Benjamin Basnage (1580-1652); the physician Hamon (1618-1687), well known in the history of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>; Jean de Launoy (1603-1678), celebrated for his critical work in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>; Marie des Vall&eacute;es, the demoniac (d. 1656), who made a great sensation in her day and whose sayings were gathered into four volumes by the Venerable P&#232;re Eudes, who had <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcised</a> her; the <a href="../cathen/02378b.htm">Abb&eacute; de Beauvais</a> (1731-1790) and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Neuville (1693-1774), both great preachers; the Abb&eacute; de Saint-Pierre (1658-1743), author of the "Paix perp&eacute;tuelle", and the <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudist</a> Le Franc, superior of the Coutances <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in the eighteenth century and the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publicist to write against <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a>.

<p>Before the enforcement of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 there were in the diocese <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>, <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudists</a>, and a local congregation of Brothers of Mercy of the Christian Schools, founded in 1842 (mother-house at Montebourg), and there are <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> still at Bricquebec. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> includes several congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: the Tertiary Sisters of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, founded in 1686; the Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, founded in the seventeenth century by P&#232;re du Pont, a <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudist</a>, and in 1783 placed under the patronage of the Sacred Heart, being the oldest French congregation known by that title; the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> of the Christian Schools, founded in 1802 at Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte by the Venerable S&aelig;ur Postel. Diocesan missionaries are installed at Biville, near the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Blessed Thomas H&eacute;lie, a much frequented place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>.

<p>In 1900 the diocese included in religious institutions, 28 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for boys and girls, 3 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 24 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 6 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 35 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, hospices, and asylums; 30 houses of nursing sisters, and 3 <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">insane asylums</a>. The statistics for the end of 1905 (close of the Concordat period) indicate a population of 491,372, with 61 pastorates, 612 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (mission churches), and 284 curacies, then remunerated by the State.
