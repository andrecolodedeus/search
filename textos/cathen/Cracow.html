<h1>Cracow</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/12196a.htm">Polish</a> <em>Krakow</em>; <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Cracoviensis</em>).

<p>The Prince-Bishopric that comprises the western portion of Galacia in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and borders on the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/08636a.htm">Kielce</a> in Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14458b.htm">Tarnow</a> in Galacia, and <a href="../cathen/15761b.htm">Zips</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>.

<p>It has long been disputed at what time the Diocese of Cracow was created. It was already in existence in the year 1000; for at that time, Poppo, its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was made a suffragan to Radzym (the Latin <em>St. Gaudentius</em>) the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> (<a href="../cathen/05047d.htm">Thietmar</a>, Chronicon, IV, in P.L. CXXXIX, 1226). Fr. Augustine Arndt, S.J. (Zeitschrift f&uuml;r kath. Theologie, XIV, 45-47, Innsbruck, 1890) adduces some reasons in support of the opinion that the Diocese of Cracow was founded by the Polish King Mieceslaw I as early as 984, and that Poppo, who had been tutor to Duke Henry of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> until 983, became its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but most authorities agree that it was not created until 1000 or shortly before. There are extant five lists of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cracow. The oldest was complied about 1266 (Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script, XIX, 608), the second before 1347 (Mon. hist. Polon, III, 801); the others are of a later date. During the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> in 1039, and the succeeding period of <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> documents were lost, and the names and the dates of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cracow, up to Bishop Aaron (1046-1059) are very unreliable. Prochorus and Proculpus, who are mentioned in the lists as predecessors of Poppo, are entirely legendary. Three of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cracow are publicly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>: St. Stanislaus Szczepanowski (1072-1079), who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at the hands of King Boleslaw, <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1253, patron of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and of the Dioceses of Cracow and Posen; <a href="../cathen/15438a.htm">Blessed Vincent Kadlubeck</a>, (108-1214), the earliest Polish historian of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and entered the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Jedrzejow in 1218, died 8 March, 1223, <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> 1764; John Prandotha (1242-1266), who drove the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/06089c.htm">Flagellants</a> from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> until the seventeenth century, when his veneration ceased, owing to a misinterpretation of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De cultu servorum Dei", issued by <a href="../cathen/15218a.htm">Urban VII</a>, 5 July, 1634. Other renown <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Matth&aelig;us (1143-1165) a historian; <a href="../cathen/11240c.htm">Zbigniew Olesnicki</a> (1423-1455), a great statesman and fearless opponent of the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1439; and George Radziwill (1591-1600), founder of <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>.

<p>Originally the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Cracow seems to have comprised the towns of <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Sandomir</a>, Cracow, and Lublin, and the castellanies of Sieradz, Spicimir, Rozpoza, Lenczyc, and Wolborg; but its area underwent various changes. From the year 1443 to 1795 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cracow were at the same time sovereign dukes of Severia, a territory situated between Silesia and Cracow. Before the first partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1772 the Diocese of Cracow composed the whole of Little <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, Sieradz, a large portion of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, and part of the present <a href="../cathen/15761b.htm">Diocese of Zips</a> (Scepusium). In 1772 it lost its territory south of the Vistula (Dioecesis Cisvistulana), which in 1783 constituted the new <a href="../cathen/14458b.htm">Diocese of Tarnow</a>. In 1790 the new <a href="../cathen/09403a.htm">Diocese of Lublin</a> and in 1805 the new <a href="../cathen/08636a.htm">Diocese of Kielce</a> were severed from its remaining territory. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a> made Cracow an exempt diocese in 1815 and restored to it a portion of the <a href="../cathen/08636a.htm">Diocese of Kielce</a> in 1817, which portion, however, was returned to Kielce in 1846, so that then the Diocese of Cracow was confined to the city Cracow and two deaneries south of the Vistula. From 1871 to 1879 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was ruled by administrators. Under Albin Dunajewski, who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1879, it was somewhat enlarged toward the south, in 1880, and again in 1886. In 1889 it was made a prince-bishopric, and a year later, Prince-Bishop Dunajewski was raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. John Puzyna de Koziel was made Prince-Bishop of Cracow in 1895, and Anatole Nowak <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> in 1900. The diocese numbers 197 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 181 vicariates, 457 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and 223 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 850,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 4000 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and 60,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The Emperor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> has the privilege of appointing the prince-bishop after consulting with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Galacia. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter includes 3 <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> (dean, scholasticus, and custos) and 6 canons. The most important <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institution</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is Cracow University (Uniwersitet Jagiellonski), founded by Casmir the Great in 1364 and approved by <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Pope Urban V</a> the same year. The diocese also has an <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>, various colleges, and minor institutions of learning. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Cracow is one of the most venerable structures in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Here lie buried most of the Polish kings, the two national heroes, <a href="../cathen/08694a.htm">Kosciuszko</a>, and Poniakowski, the greatest Polish poet, <a href="../cathen/10283a.htm">Mickiewicz</a>, and many other noble sons of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; here also are preserved the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Stanislaus (see above). It is of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>, originally built probably by Mieceslaw I about 966, where now stands the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Michael and where St. Stanislaus suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; rebuilt on its present site by Ladislaus Herman, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1083-1102); restored by Nanker Oksza, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cracow (1320-1326); rebuilt in the eighteenth century in barocco style; and renovated from 1886-1901. It contains the beautiful <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Sigmund, the best specimen of <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style in Eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, built by Bartolommeo da Firenze in the sixteenth century and renovated in 1894. The Church of St. Mary, a Gothic structure built 1226-1397 and restored in the fourteenth century, has on its <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> a large Gothic wood carving representing the death of the Virgin Mary, the masterpiece of <a href="../cathen/14310a.htm">Veit Stoss</a>.

<p>The chief charitable institution is the Archconfraternity of Mercy, founded by <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Peter Skargo (d. 1618), which distributes alms to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and is the owner of a <em>monte-de-pi&eacute;t&eacute;</em>. There are also: another <em>monte-de-pi&eacute;t&eacute;</em>, an asylum for old men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, three <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, and insane asylum, various <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and workhouses. All these establishments are subject to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authorities. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press is represented by two dailies, two weeklies edited by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, three monthlies published by religious, and two monthly magazines of high literary standard. They are all in Polish.

<p>The following <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations of men are engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, or charitable work: Augustinians, Brothers of Mercy, <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a>, <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of the Lateran, <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of the Holy Sepulchre, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, Discalced Carmeli tes (2 houses), Capuchans, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> (Abbey of Mogila), <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventual Franciscans</a>, Observant <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (here called Bernadines; 3 houses), Reformed <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (3 houses), <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Hermits of St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (2 houses), <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> (3 houses). <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, Resurrectionists, <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> Tertiaries, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, Sisters of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a>, <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo</a>, Sisters of St. Felix, Sisters of the Holy Family, Sisters of the Mother of Mercy, Sisters of Nazareth, Sisters of the Presentation, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentian</a> Sisters, Servants of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
