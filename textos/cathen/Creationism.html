<h1>Creationism</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>creatio</em>).

<p>(1) In the widest sense, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the material of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> out of no pre-existing subject. It is thus opposed to all forms of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>.

<p>(2) Less widely, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the various species of living beings were immediately and directly created or produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are not therefore the product of an evolutionary process. It is thus opposed to Transformism.

<p>(3) In a restricted but more usual sense, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the individual human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the immediate effect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creative act. It is thus opposed to Traducianism. The first two acceptations of the term are treated in the article <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">CREATION</a>; the third alone is here considered. The proposition that the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is immediately created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a corollary of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> spirituality. Certain psychical phenomena, viz. <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and volitional &#151; especially when they regard immaterial objects &#151; indicate that their radical principle subsists essentially and intrinsically independent of the purely corporeal organism. This transmaterial subsistence supposes a corresponding mode of origin; for that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must have had a beginning follows obviously from its finitude and contingency. That origin cannot be: <ul> <li>by way of emanation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheists</a> declare, since the Divine substance, being absolutely simple, cannot be subject to any emissional process; <li>nor by spiritual generation from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> &#151; as the German <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Frohschammer (1821-1893) maintained &#151; because human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, being essentially and integrally simple and indivisible, can give forth no spiritual germs or reproductive elements; <li>still less by physical generation (as corporeal Traducianists suppose), since such a mode of production plainly conflicts both with the essential simplicity and the spirituality of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. </ul> The only other intelligible source of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> existence is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and since the characteristic and exclusive act of the Divine Cause is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must owe its origin to that operation.

<p>As regards the time when the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is created, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculation varies. The ancient <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the pre-natal existence of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and their subsequent incarceration in bodies may be passed over as poetic fiction and not scientific theory. The same may be said of the ancient hypothesis of transmigration, which, however, still survives in <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> and is revived by recent <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">Theosophy</a>. Besides being entirely gratuitous, <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a> rests on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> view which conceives of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as only accidentally, not essentially, combined in the unity of the human <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The traditional philosophy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> holds that the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is created at the moment when it is infused into the new organism. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, following <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> embryology, taught that the human foetus passes through progressive stages of formation wherein it is successively animated by the vegetative, sensitive, and rational principles, each succeeding form summing up virtually the potencies of its predecessor. Accordingly, the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is created when the antecedent principles of life have rendered the foetus an appropriate organism for rational life, though some time is required after birth before the sensory organs are sufficiently developed to assist in the functions of intelligence. In this view the embryonic history of man is an epitome of the stages through which the upward march of life on our globe is now held by <a href="../cathen/11410a.htm">pal&aelig;ontologists</a> to have passed. On the other hand, most neo-Scholastics hold that the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is created and infused into the incipient human being at the moment of conception. It should be noted that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Creationism is not an appeal to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> or the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">"miraculous"</a> to account for a natural effect. The creation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the First Cause, when second causes have posited the pertinent conditions, falls within the order of nature; it is a so-called "law of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>", not an interference therewith, as is the case in a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>.

<p>So much for the philosophical or purely rational aspect of Creationism; as regards the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, it should be noted that while none of the Fathers maintained Traducianism &#151; the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> generation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> &#151; as a <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, some of them, notably <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, at the outbreak of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, began to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the creation by god of the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (there was never any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the created origin of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>), and to incline to the opposite opinion, which seemed to facilitate the explanation of the transmission of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Thus, writing to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, St. Augustine says: "If that opinion of the creation of new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is not opposed to this established <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> [sc. <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>] let it be also mine; if it is, let it not be thine" (Ep. clxvi, n.25). <a href="../cathen/01075a.htm">Theodorus Abucara</a> (Opusc. xxxv), Macarius (Hom. xxx), and <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> (De Opif., Hom., c. xxix) favoured this view. Amongst the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> there were no defenders of Traducianism. <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> (De Sacr., VII, c. xii) and <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> (Summa, I, Q. lx, mem. 2, a. 3) alone characterize Creationism as the more probable opinion; all the other <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> hold it as certain and differ only in regard to the censure that should be attached to the opposite <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> simply says: "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are created at their infusion into the body" (Sent. II, d. xviii); while <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> is more emphatic: "It is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> to say that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is transmitted by process of generation" (I, Q. cxviii, a. 2). For the rest, the following citation from the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a> sums up the diverse opinions: "Regarding this question various opinions were expressed in antiquity. Some held that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a child is produced by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the parent just as the body is generated by the parent-body. Others maintained that all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are created apart, moreover that they are united with their respective bodies, either by their own volition or by the command and action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Others again, declared that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the moment of its creation is infused into the body. Though for a time these several views were upheld, and though it was <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> which came nearest the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (as appears from Augustine's commentary on <a href="../bible/gen010.htm">Genesis 10</a>, and from his books on the origin of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>), the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> subsequently condemned the first two and approved the third" (De Potenti&acirc;, Q. iii, a. 9). Others (e.g. <a href="../cathen/07021b.htm">Gregory of Valencia</a>) speak of Generationism as "certainly erroneous", or (e.g. <a href="../cathen/05547a.htm">Estius</a>) as <em>maxime temerarius</em>. It should, however, be noted that while there are no such explicit definitions authoritatively put forth by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as would warrant our calling the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Creationism <em>de fide</em>, nevertheless, as a recent eminent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> observes, "there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to which view is favoured by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority" (<a href="../cathen/11739b.htm">Pesch</a>, Pr&aelig;l. Dogm., V, 3, p. 66). <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> (1050), in the symbol presented to the Bishop Peter for subscription, lays down: "I believe and profess that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but is created out of nothing, and that, without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, it is in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchir., n. 296). That the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in its pre-existent state, and on that account was incarcerated in the body, is a fiction which has been repeatedly condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Divested of this fiction, the theory that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> exists prior to its infusion into the organism, while not explicitly reprobated, is obviously opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to which <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are multiplied correspondingly with the multiplication of human organisms (Conc. Lat. V, in <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, op. cit., 621). But whether the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is infused into the organism at conception, as the modern opinion holds, or some weeks subsequently, as the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> suppose (St. Thomas, Q. i a. 2, ad 2), is an open question with <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> (<a href="../cathen/08667a.htm">Kleutgen</a>, Phil. d. Vorzeit, II, 657).
