<h1>Creed</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>credo</em>, I believe).

<p>In general, a form of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. The word, however, as applied to religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> has received a variety of meanings, two of which are specially important. (1) It signifies the entire body of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> held by the adherents of a given religion; and in this sense it is equivalent <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> where the latter is used in its objective meaning. Such is its signification in expressions like "the conflict of creeds", "charitable works irrespective of creed", "the ethics of conformity of creed", etc. (2) In a somewhat narrower sense, a creed is a summary of the principal <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> professed by church or community of believers. Thus by the "creeds of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>" are understood those formulations of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> which at various times have been drawn up and accepted by one or the other of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches. The Latins designate the creed in this sense by the name <em>symbolum</em> which means either a sign (<em>symbolon</em>) or a collection (<em>symbole</em>). A creed, then, would be the distinctive mark of those who hold a given <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, or a formula made up of the principal articles of that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. A "profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" is enjoined by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on special occasions, as at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; while the phrase "confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" is commonly applied to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> formularies, such as the "Augsburg Confession", the "Confession of Basle", etc. It should be noted, however, that the role of Faith is not identical with creed, but, in its formal signification, means the norm or standard by which one ascertains what doctrines are to be believed.

<p>The principal creeds of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, The Apostles', Athanasian, and the Nicene, are treated in special articles which enter into the historical details and the content of each. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use of the Creed is also explained in a separate article. For the present purpose it is chiefly important to indicate the function of the creed in the life of religion and especially in the work of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. That the teachings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> were to be cast in some definite form is evidently implied in the commission given the Apostles (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs19">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). Since they were to teach all nations to observe whatsoever Christ had commanded, and since this teaching was to carry the weight of authority, not merely of opinion, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to formulate at last the essential doctrines. Such formulation was all the more needful because <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was destined for all men and for all ages. To preserve unity of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> itself was quite clearly stated. The creed, therefore, is fundamentally an authoritative declaration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that are to be believed.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, moreover, was organized as a visible <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">CHURCH</a>). Its members were called on not only to hold fast the teaching they had received, but also to express their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. As <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says: "With her heart we believe unto <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; but, with the mouth, confession is made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>" (Romans x, 10). Nor is the Apostle content with vague or indefinite statements; he insists that his followers shall "hold the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (<a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs13">2 Timothy 1:13</a>), "embracing that faithful word which is according to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, that he (the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>) may be able to exhort in sound <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and to convince the gainsayers (Titus i, 9). Hence we can understand that a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was required of those who were to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, as in the case of the eunuch (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs37">Acts 8:37</a>); in fact the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> formula prescribed by Christ himself is an expression of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>. Apart then from the question regarding the composition of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>, it is clear that from the beginning, and even before the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> had been written, some <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> formula, however concise, would have been employed both to secure uniformity in teaching and to place beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of those who were admitted into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Along with the diffusion of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> there sprang up in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> views regarding the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It thus became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to define the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of revelation more clearly. The creed, in consequence, underwent modification, not by the introduction of new doctrines, but by the expression of the traditional <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in terms that left no room for <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or misunderstanding. In this way the "Filioque" was added to the Nicene and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> Profession forth in full and definite statements the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> on those points especially which the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> of the sixteenth century had assailed. At other times the circumstances required that special formulas should be drawn up in order to have the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> explicitly stated and accepted; such was the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> prescribed For the Greeks by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> and that which <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> prescribed for the Orientals(cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion). The creed therefore, is to be regarded not as a lifeless formula, but rather as a manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> vitality. As these formulas preserve intact the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> once delivered to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, they are also an effectual means of warding off the incessant attacks of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.

<p>On the other hand it should be remarked that the authoritative <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of a creed and its acceptance imply no infringement of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of reason. The mind tends naturally to express itself and especially to utter its thought in the form of language. Such expression, again, results in greater clearness and a firmer possession of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> content. Whoever, then, really believes in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> cannot consistently object to such manifestation of his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> as the use of the creed implies it is also obviously illogical to condemn this use on the ground that is makes religion simply an affair of repeating or subscribing empty formulas. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> insists that the internal <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is the essential element, but this must find its outward expression. While the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> rests on each individual, there are further <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> resulting from the social organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Not only is each member <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to refrain from what would weaken the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of his fellow-believers, he is also bound, so far as he is able, to uphold and quicken their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, The profession of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as set forth in the creed is at once an object-lesson in loyalty and a means of strengthening the bonds which unite the followers of Christ in "one Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>".

<p>Such motives are plainly of no avail where the selection of his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> is left to the individual. He may, of course, adopt a series of articles or propositions and call it a creed; but it remains his private possession, and any attempt on this part to demonstrate its correctness can only result in disagreement. But the attempt itself would be inconsistent, since he must concede to every one else the same right in the matter of framing a creed. The final consequence must be, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is reduced to the level of views, opinions, or theories such as are entertained on purely scientific matters. Hence it is not easy to explain, on the basis of consistence, the action of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Reformers</a>. Had the principle of private judgment been fully and strictly carried out, the formulation of creeds would have been unnecessary and, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>, impossible. The subsequent course of events has shown how little was to be accomplished by confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, once the essential element of authority was rejected, From the inevitable multiplication of creeds has developed, in large measure, that demand for a "creedless Gospel" which contrasts so strongly with the claim that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> is the sole rule and the only source of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">DOGMA</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">FAITH</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">PROTESTANTISM</a>.)
