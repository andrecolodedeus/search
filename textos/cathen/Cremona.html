<h1>Cremona</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF CREMONA (CREMONENSIS)

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Cremona is a city (31,661 in 1901) in the Province of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, on the left bank of the Po. It was built by the Cenomanni Gauls, but later became a Roman colony and a frontier fortress; it succumbed, however, to Hannibal. After the victory of Octavian over Antony, the territory was divided among the veterans of the conqueror. Caius Vitellius defended it unsuccessfully against <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, by whom it was pillaged, but it rose again from its ruins. About A.D. 600 Cremona, until then Byzantine, was captured by the Lombard king, Agilulf. Under the Emperors Otto (I-III) its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> acquired temporal sovereignty, but in 900 the people expelled Bishop Olderico and adopted a republican form of government. The emperor Henry IV (1056-1106), however, confirmed Bishop Landulf in all imperial grants made to his predecessors. On the other hand Henry V (1106-25) restored to the people their communal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Thenceforth Cremona became a citadel of Ghibellinism and was greatly favoured by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederic Barbarossa</a> and <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, though for the same reason frequently at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the neighbouring cities. In later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> it had many lords or "tyrants", the Pallavicini, the Bovara, the Cavalcabo, the Visconti, the Sforza, until it became part of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1328). In 1702 it was taken by imperial troops, and in 1796 and 1800 fell into the hands of the French.

<p>The people of Cremona venerate St. Sabinus as their first missionary and first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; he is said to have lived in the first century of our era. Among the better-known early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are St. Syrinus (c. 340), a valiant <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> of the Faith against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and St. Silvinus (733); the latter is held in great veneration. <a href="../cathen/09313a.htm">Liudprand of Cremona</a> was sent (946) as ambassador to Constantinople by the Emperor <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, and is the most famous historical writer of the tenth century. Other important <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Gualtiero (1096), in whose time the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun; <a href="../cathen/13770b.htm">Sicardo</a> (1185), author of a chronicle; Cacciaconte da Somma (1261), under whom was erected the <a href="../cathen/02394d.htm">belfry</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Nicolo Sfondrati (1560), later <a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Pope Gregory XIV</a>; his nephew Paolo (1607); also the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and charitable Omobono di Offredi (1791). The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Cremona is a splendid specimen of Romanesque architecture, dates from the beginning of the twelfth century, and is noted for its <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> in alternate courses of red and white marble. It possesses many famous <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a>. Its two marble <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a> were brought thither from the suppressed church of the <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetans</a>. Near the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> (1167), surrounded by ranges of narrow Lombard arches, and bearing aloft an octagonal <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>. The famous brick campanile, known as the Torrazzo, built in 1283 as a peace monument, is 396 feet high and is said to be the tallest in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. An ancient saying runs: <em>Unus Petrus in Roma, una turris in Cremona</em> (One Peter in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, one Tower in Cremona). Other noteworthy churches are those of Sant'Agata and Sant'Agostino, the latter externally Gothic, while its interior is <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. San Pietro and San Michele are believed to date from the time of the Lombard Queen Theodolinda (c. 590). There are many industries at Cremona, especially silk manufactures; in the history of music it is known as the birthplace of four famous makers of violins: Amati, Guarneri, <a href="../cathen/14311a.htm">Stradivari</a>, and Malpighi.

<p>The population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is 350,000; it has 345 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 530 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 536 secular and 38 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 9 houses of religious men, and 77 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. It has also 15 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>.
