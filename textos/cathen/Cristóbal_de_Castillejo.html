<h1>Crist&oacute;bal de Castillejo</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> poet, b. in Ciudad Rodrigo (Salamanca), 1491; d. in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 12 June, 1556. From the age of fifteen he was attached to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the younger brother of the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, the Infante Ferdinand, who subsequently became King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and eventually Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He lived for many years in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> as secretary to that prince, and late in life took <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> orders, retiring to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> where he passed the remainder of his days. Castillego was the champion of the old <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Spanish verse as opposed to the Italian measures recently introduced by Boscan, seconded by <a href="../cathen/06381a.htm">Garcilasso de la Vega</a>. He vigorously opposed the innovation, maintaining and demonstrating in his writings that the old metres were amply competent for the expression of all sentiments. When he did use the <em>villancicos, canciones</em>, and other measures of the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, it was only to attack and ridicule the innovators.

<p>As a poet he was distinguished for purity of language, grace, fluency, and humour, the latter quality abounding in his "Dialogue between Himself and His Pen". He used satire with simplicity and ease, and, at times, freely and boldly. Some of his satires, notable the "Sermon on Love" and the "Dialogue on the Condition of Women", were so offensive to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> prohibited the publication of his poems until they had been expurgated. Among his other works are the fanciful "transformation of a Drunkard into a Mosquito" and a satire addressed "To those who give up the Castillian measures and follow the Italian". His poems are divided into three books devoted to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; conversation and pastime; moral and religious verses. In 1573 a collection of the "Works of Castillejo Expurgated by the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>" was published in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, which was one of the first books printed in that city. The most complete edition is that published by Ram&oacute;n Fernandez (Madrid, 1792).
