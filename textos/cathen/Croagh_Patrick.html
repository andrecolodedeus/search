<h1>Croagh Patrick</h1>  

<p>A mountain looking out on the Atlantic ocean from the southern shore of Clew Bay, in the County Mayo, and called "the Sinai of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>." In <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> times it was known as <em>Cruachan Aigli</em>. It rises in a perfect cone to a height of 2510 feet. The account given below is taken from sources that post-date the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> death by three hundred years. There are, however, good reasons to believe that the traditions they embody are genuine, <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> was careworn and fatigued when he came to this remote part of the country. He longed to retire for a while to refresh his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in solitude, and for that purpose on the Saturday before <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a> in the year 441, he betook himself to the mountain top. Here he spent the days of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, chastising his body with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, pouring out his heart to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and entreating Him with prolonged importunity and with tears that the Faith may not fail in the land of Erin. The "Book of Armagh mentions that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> summoned all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of Erin, past, present and future, to appear before their father in the Faith to comfort him with a vision of the teeming harvest his labours would produce, and to join him in blessing their kinsmen and their country. The "Tripartite Life" relates that when <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> was on <em>Cruachan Aigli</em> in 441, word was brought to him that a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ruled the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on the 29th of September, 440. <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a>, as soon as he heard it, dispatched one of his disciples named Munis to bear his filial homage to the Vicar of Christ, to render an account of his labours and his teaching, and to beg a blessing for the infant church in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The 'Annals of Clonmacnoise" relate that Munis came back from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> bearing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relics</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had given him for the altars that <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> was erecting every where through the country. 'I'he same event is briefly referred to in the "Annals of Ulster", under <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 441: "Leo <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> forty-second <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of the Church of Rome</a>; and <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick the bishop</a> was approved in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>". It adds a special glory to Croagh Patrick that its first tribute of homage from the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church to the Chair of Peter was sent from its hoary summit. From that sacred spot on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> with outstretched hands solemnly blessed the men of Erin that they might cling to the Faith, and the land of Erin that no poisonous reptile might infest it. Then, refreshed with divine grace and comforted with the assurance that his labours would fructify forever, he came down from the mountain to celebrate <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> with the little flock he had left at Aughagower.

<p>From the days of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> himself <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> began to do penance oil his holy mountain. References to them are found in many pages of the annals of the country. It is recorded that in the year 1113, on the night of the 17th of March, during a thunderstorm, thirty of the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> perished on the summit. The "Annals of Boyle" relate that Hugh O'Connor, King of Connaught, who came to the throne in the year 1225, cut off the hands and the feet of an outlaw who dared to molest a pilgrim on his way to Croagh Patrick. The following document of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, dated. 28 September, 1432, shows how this ancient <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> was recognized and honored in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. "A relaxation of two years and two quarantines of enjoined penance, under the usual conditions, to those penitents who visit and give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for the repair of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Patrick, on the mountain which is called Croagh Patrick whither resorts a great multitude of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to venerate <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> the Sunday before the feast of St. Peter's Chains" (Calendar etc., of Papal Registers, Vol. IV). From <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick's</a> own time there had been some sort of a little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the summit.

<p>The "Tripartite Life" relates that, the apostle himself celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> on the mountain, from which we infer that he had an altar and a place to shelter it. For several centuries the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Armagh laid claim to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the grounds that it was founded by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> and that they were his successors; but the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a> contended that it belonged to their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Finally, Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> On the 30th of July, 1216 assigned it to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a> (Calendar Pap. Reg., Vol. 1). But in penal times when Murrisk Abbey at the mountain's base was dismantled, the venerable <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> on the summit was demolished. Still the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> never ceased to go there. It was not, however, till 1905 that the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the heights was rebuilt, and then on the 30th of July, Archbishop Healy dedicated it to <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> in the presence of many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The day of annual <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> from time immemorial had been the last Sunday in July. On that day about twenty Masses are celebrated within the little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> while often there have been more than 20,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> kneeling without.
