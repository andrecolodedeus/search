<h1>Cronan</h1>  

<p>Name of several Irish <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.
<h2>St. Cronan Mochua</h2>

<p>Founder of the See of Balla, subsequently merged into that of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, flourished in the period 596-637, d. 30 March, 637, but his Acts are more or less of a legendary character. However, it would appear that he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Bangor, under <a href="../cathen/04152c.htm">St. Comgall</a>, and founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Gael, among the Feara Rois of Louth and Monaghan, whence he migrated to Fore and Tehilly. Passing through Hy Many, he journeyed to Connacht, in 616, and founded the church and Abbey of Balla, of which he was first abbot-bishop. Numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are recorded of St. Cronan Mochua, and are minutely described in his <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> life. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 30 March, though, through a misconception, his Acts are given by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> under <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 1 January.
<h2>St. Cronan, abbot</h2>

<p>Abbot-Bishop and Patron of Roscrea, a see afterwards incorporated in that of <a href="../cathen/08641a.htm">Killaloe</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; b. in the territory of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> O'Carroll; d. 28 April 640. After spending his youth in Connacht, he returned to his native district about the year 610 and founded Abbey Roscrea, where he established a famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Previously he settled at a place known as Sean Ros or Loch Cre, a wooded morass far from the haunts of men; in fact, it was utterly wild, so much so, that St. Cronan abandoned it and moved to the wood of Cre, that is Ros cre, County Tipperary. Like those of so many other <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> the Acts of St. Cronan abound in <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The most surprising, perhaps, is the legend as to the transcribing of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a> by one of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, named Dimma. It appears that Dimma could only undertake one day's task, from sunrise to sunset. St. Cronan, however, bade him write, and then Dimma set to work, never ceasing till he had finished the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a>, the sun continuing to shine for the space of forty days and forty nights - the scribe himself being unconscious that the work occupied more than one day. Whatever may be thought of this legend, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that a magnificent Evangelistarium, known as the "Book of Dimma", was for centuries preserved in St. Cronan's Abbey at Roscrea, and is now in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of Trinity College, Dublin. The scribe, Dimma MacNathi, signs his name at the conclusion of each of the Gospels, and he has been identified with Dimma, subsequently <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Connor</a>, who is mentioned with St. Cronan in the letter of <a href="../cathen/08422b.htm">Pope John IV</a> in 640, in regard to <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but this identification cannot be sustained. The case containing the "Book of Dimma" was richly gilt by order of O'Carroll, Lord of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, in the twelfth century. Notwithstanding the conflicting statements arising from the number of contemporary <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> bearing the name Cronan, it is more than probable that St. Cronan of Roscrea, as les Petits Bollandistes say, lived as late as the year 640, and his death occurred on 28 April of that year. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 28 April and as such is included in all the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a>, as also in the Kalendar of Drummond.
<h2>Other saints named Cronan</h2>

<p>A number of other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of this name find a place in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a>. The three most important are St. Cronan Mochua, of Clashmore (10 February); St. Cronan, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clonmacnoise (18 July); and St. Cronan, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Moville (7 September). Another saint frequently quoted as of this name is really St. Cuaran (Cuaranus Sapiens), whose feast occurs on 9 February. There is also a St. Cronan Mochua of Sliabh Eibhlem (4 May).
