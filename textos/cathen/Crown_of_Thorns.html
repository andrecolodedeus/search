<h1>Crown of Thorns</h1>  

<p>Although <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour's</a> Crown of Thorns is mentioned by three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> and is often alluded to by the early <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Christian Fathers</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and others, there are comparatively few writers of the first six centuries who speak of it as a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> known to be still in existence and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. It is remarkable that <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, who expatiates upon the Cross, the Title, and the <a href="../cathen/10672a.htm">Nails</a> discovered by <a href="../cathen/07202b.htm">St. Helena</a> (Tobler, Itinera Hierosolym., II, 36), says nothing either of the Lance or of the Crown of Thorns, and the silence of Andreas of Crete in the eighth century is even more surprising. Still there are some exceptions. <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a>, writing after 409, refers to "the thorns with which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour</a> was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>" as <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> along with the Cross to which He was nailed and the pillar at which He was scourged (Ep. ad Macar. in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LXI, 407). <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> (c. 570), when commenting on <a href="../bible/psa086.htm">Psalm 86</a>, speaks of the Crown of Thorns among the other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> which are the glory of the earthly <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. "There", he says, "we may behold the thorny crown, which was only set upon the head of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Redeemer</a> in order that all the thorns of the world might be gathered together and broken" (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LXX, 621). When <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> ("De glori&acirc; mart." in "Mon. Germ. Hist.: Scrip. Merov.", I, 492) avers that the thorns in the Crown still looked green, a freshness which was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> renewed each day, he does not much strengthen the historical testimony for the authenticity of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>, but the "Breviarius", and the "Itinerary" of Antoninus of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, both of the sixth century, clearly state that the Crown of Thorns was at that period shown in the church upon Mount Sion (Geyer, Itinera Hierosolymitana, 154 and 174). From these fragments of evidence and others of later date &#151; the "Pilgrimage" of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Bernard shows that the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was still at Mount Sion in 870 &#151; it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that what purported to be the Crown of Thorns was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> for several hundred years.

<p>If we may adopt the conclusion of M. de M&eacute;ly, the whole Crown was only transferred to Byzantium about 1063, although it seems that smaller portions must have been presented to the Eastern emperors at an earlier date. In any case Justinian, who died in 565, is stated to have given a thorn to <a href="../cathen/06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, which was long preserved at Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, while the Empress Irene, in 798 or 802, sent <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> several thorns which were deposited by him at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen.</a> Eight of these are known to have been there at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the basilica of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Pope Leo III</a>, and the subsequent history of several of them can be traced without difficulty. Four were given to Saint-Corneille of Compi&egrave;gne in 877 by Charles the Bald. One was sent by Hugh the Great to the Anglo-Saxon King Athelstan in 927 on the occasion of certain marriage negotiations, and eventually found its way to Malmesbury Abbey. Another was presented to a Spanish princess about 1160, and again another was taken to Andechs in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the year 1200.

<p>In 1238 Baldwin II, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople, anxious to obtain support for his tottering empire, offered the Crown of Thorns to <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">St. Louis, King of France.</a> It was then actually in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> as security for a heavy loan, but it was redeemed and conveyed to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where St. Louis built the Sainte-Chapelle (completed 1248) for its reception. There the great <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> remained until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, when, after finding a home for a while in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, it was eventually restored to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and was deposited in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Notre-Dame in 1806. Ninety years later (in 1896) a magnificent new <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> of rock crystal was made for it, covered for two- thirds of its circumference with a silver case splendidly wrought and jewelled. The Crown thus preserved consists only of a circlet of rushes, without any trace of thorns. Authorities are agreed that a sort of helmet of thorns must have been platted by the Roman soldiers, this band of rushes being employed to hold the thorns together. It seems likely according to M. De M&eacute;ly, that already at the time when the circlet was brought to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the sixty or seventy thorns, which seem to have been afterwards distributed by St. Louis and his successors, had been separated from the band of rushes and were kept in a different <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a>. None of these now remain at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Some small fragments of rush are also preserved apart from the <em>sainte Couronne</em> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, e.g. at <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> and at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. With regard to the origin and character of the thorns, both tradition and existing remains suggest that they must have come from the bush botanically known as <em>Zizyphus spina Christi</em>, more popularly, the jujube-tree. This reaches the height of fifteen or twenty feet and is found growing in abundance by the wayside around <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The crooked branches of this shrub are armed with thorns growing in pairs, a straight spine and a curved one commonly occurring together at each point. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> preserved in the Capella della Spina at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, as well as that at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, which though their early history is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> and obscure, are among the largest in size, afford a good illustration of this peculiarity.

<p>That all the reputed holy thorns of which notice has survived cannot by any possibility be authentic will be disputed by no one. M. de M&eacute;ly has been able to enumerate more than 700 such <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. The statement in one <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> obituary that Peter de Averio gave to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Angers "unam de spinis quae fuit apposita coronae spinae nostri Redemptoris" (de M&eacute;ly, p. 362), meaning seemingly a thorn which has <em>touched</em> the real Crown of Thorns, throws a flood of light upon the probable origin of many such <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. Again, even in comparatively modern times it is not always easy to trace the history of these objects of devotion, which were often divided and thus multiplied. Two "holy thorns" are at present <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, the one at St. Michael's church in <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, the other at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst College</a>, both professing, upon what seems quite satisfactory evidence, to be the thorn given by <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Queen of Scots</a> to <a href="../cathen/14697a.htm">Thomas Percy Earl of Northumberland</a> (see "The Month", April, 1882, 540-556). Finally, it should be pointed out that the appearance of the Crown of Thorns in art, notably upon the head of Christ in representations of the Crucifixion, is posterior to the time of St. Louis and the building of the Sainte-Chapelle. Some archaeologists have professed to discover a figure of the Crown of Thorns in the circle which sometimes surrounds the <a href="../cathen/08717c.htm"><em>chi-rho</em></a> emblem on early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sarcophagi, but it seems to be quite as probable that this is only meant for a laurel-wreath.
