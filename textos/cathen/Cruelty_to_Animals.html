<h1>Cruelty to Animals</h1>  

<h2>Pagan antiquity</h2>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> writers of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> antiquity to advocate the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of kindness towards the brute creation were <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoras</a> and Empedocles. Holding the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a>, or the transmigration of human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> into the bodies of lower animals after death, these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> taught that animals share in human <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and that it is a crime to kill them. These <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, together with an appreciation of the services rendered by domestic animals to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, found some expression in early <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman legislation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of ascribing human <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to animals is condemned by Cicero (<em>De Finibus</em>, Book III, xx).
<h2>Old Testament</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> inculcates kindness towards animals. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were forbidden to muzzle the ox that treads out the corn (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#vrs4">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>) or to yolk together an ox and an ass (<a href="../bible/deu022.htm#vrs10">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>). Some other texts which are frequently quoted as instances are not so much to recommend kind treatment of animals as to insist upon <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of neighbourly goodwill. The prohibition against seething the kid in its mother's milk, a process in which there is no cruelty at all, and the one against taking a mother-bird with her young, seem to have a religious rather than a humanitarian significance.
<h2>New Testament</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is almost silent on this subject. Even when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> cites the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic</a> prohibition against muzzling the ox, he brushes aside the literal in favour of a symbolic signification (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs9">1 Corinthians 9:9 sq.</a>). The <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> insist but little on this point of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. Nevertheless, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teaching and practice from the beginning respect in a general way the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> ideal of righteousness which is expressed in the words: "The just regardeth the lives of his beasts: but the bowels of the wicked are cruel" (<a href="../bible/pro012.htm#vrs10">Proverbs 12:10</a>). The <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiological literature</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">monastic life</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, which so largely formed and guided the moral sentiment of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>, as Lecky sets forth with ample evidence, "represents one of the most striking efforts made in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> to inculcate a feeling of kindness and pity towards the brute creation" (<em>History of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne</em>, II, 161 sqq.). This considerate feeling was a characteristic of many holy personages, even before <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> and some of his followers carried it to a degree that seems almost incredible.
<h2>The Scholastics</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> condemn the infliction of needless suffering on animals, chiefly because of the injurious effects on the character of the perpetrator. Thus <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, in his <em>Summa Contra Gentiles</em> (Book II, 112), after refuting the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that it is not lawful to take the lives of brutes, explains the import of the above-mentioned texts of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. He says that these prohibitions are issued either

<blockquote><p>lest anyone by exercising cruelty towards brutes may become cruel also towards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; or, because an injury to brutes may result in loss to the owner, or on account of some symbolic signification.</p></blockquote>

<p>Elsewhere (<a href="../summa/2102.htm#article6"><em>Summa Theologica</em> I-II:102:6 ad 8um</a>) he states that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> purpose in recommending kind treatment of the brute creation is to dispose <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to pity and tenderness for one another. While the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastics</a> rest their condemnation of cruelty to animals on its demoralizing influence, their general teaching concerning the nature of man's <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> furnishes principles which have but to be applied in order to establish the direct and essential <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinfulness</a> of cruelty to the animal world, irrespective of the results of such conduct on the character of those who practise it.
<h2>Catholic doctrine</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">Catholic ethics</a> has been criticized by some zoophilists because it refuses to admit that animals have <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. But it is indisputable that, when properly understood and fairly judged, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> &#151; though it does not concede <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the brute creation &#151; denounces cruelty to animals as vigorously and as <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> as do those <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a> who make our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> in this respect the correlative of a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> in the animals.

<p>In order to establish a binding <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to avoid the wanton infliction of pain on the brutes, it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to acknowledge any <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> inherent in them. Our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> in this respect is part of our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From the juristic standpoint the visible world with which man comes in contact is divided into <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and non-persons. For the latter term the word "things" is usually employed. Only a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, that is, a being possessed of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">self-control</a>, can be the subject of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>; or, to express the same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in terms more familiar to adherents of other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of thought, only beings who are ends in themselves, and may not be treated as mere means to the perfection of other beings, can possess <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">Rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> are moral ties which can exist only in a moral being, or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Beings that may be treated simply as means to the perfection of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> can have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and to this category the brute creation belongs. In the Divine plan of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> the lower creatures are subordinated to the welfare of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.

<p>But while these animals are, in contradistinction to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, classed as things, it is none the less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that between them and the non-sentient world there exists a profound difference of nature which we are bound to consider in our treatment of them. The very essence of the moral law is that we respect and obey the order established by the Creator. Now, the animal is a nobler manifestation of His power and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> than the lower forms of material existence. In imparting to the brute creation a sentient nature capable of suffering &#151; a nature which the animal shares in common with ourselves &#151; God placed on our dominion over them a restriction which does not exist with regard to our dominion over the non-sentient world. We are bound to act towards them in a manner conformable to their nature. We may lawfully use them for our reasonable wants and welfare, even though such employment of them necessarily inflicts pain upon them. But the wanton infliction of pain is not the satisfaction of any reasonable need, and, being an outrage against the Divinely established order, is therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>. This principle, by which, at least in the abstract, we may solve the problem of the lawfulness of <a href="../cathen/15494a.htm">vivisection</a> and other cognate questions, is tersely put by <a href="../cathen/15759a.htm">Zigliara</a>:

<blockquote><p>The service of man is the end appointed by the Creator for brute animals. When, therefore, man, with no reasonable purpose, treats the brute cruelly he does wrong, not because he violates the right of the brute, but because his action conflicts with the order and the design of the Creator (<em>Philosophia Moralis</em>, 9th ed., Rome, p. 136).</p></blockquote>

<p>With more feeling, but with no less exactness, the late <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> expressed the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>:

<blockquote><p>It is perfectly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> are between moral <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and therefore the lower animals are not susceptible of the moral <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> which we owe to one another; but we owe a seven-fold <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to the Creator of those animals. Our <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> and moral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is to Him who made them and if we wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the limit and the broad outline of our <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, I say at once it is <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">His nature and His perfections</a>, and among these perfections one is, most profoundly, that of Eternal Mercy. And therefore, although a poor mule or a poor horse is not, indeed, a moral <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, yet the Lord and Maker of the mule is the highest Lawgiver, and His nature is a law unto Himself. And in giving a dominion over His creatures to man, He gave it subject to the condition that it should be used in conformity to His perfections which is His own law, and therefore our law (<em>The Zoophilist</em>, London, 1 April, 1887). </p></blockquote>

<p>While <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> insists upon the merciful treatment of animals, it does not place kindness towards them on the same plane of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> as benevolence towards our fellow-men. Nor does it approve of unduly magnifying, to the neglect of higher <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, our <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> concerning animals. Excessive fondness for them is no sure index of moral worth; it may be carried to un-Christian excess; and it can coexist with grave laxity in far more important matters. There are many imitators of Schopenhauer, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> his dog and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his kind.
