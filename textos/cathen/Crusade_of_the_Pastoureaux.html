<h1>Crusade of the Pastoureaux</h1>  

<p>One of the most curious of the popular movements inspired by a desire to deliver the Holy Land. St. Louis, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, had gone on the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> (1248), leaving the regency to his mother, Blanche of Castile. Defeated at the battle of Mansourah (8 Feb., 1250) and taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, he regained his freedom by surrendering Damietta, embarked for <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Saint-Jean d'Acre</a>, and sent his brothers to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to obtain relief. But Blanche of Castile endeavoured in vain to send him reinforcements, neither nobles nor <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> showing good will in this respect. At this juncture the shepherds and labourers rose up, announcing that they would go to the king's rescue. About <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (16 April), 1251, a mysterious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose real name is unknown but who was soon called the "Master of Hungary", began to preach the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> to the shepherds in the north of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was sixty years of age and aroused wonder by his long <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>, his thin face, and his always-closed hand, which held, it was said, the map given to him by the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. He drew crowds by his eloquence, and distributed the Cross among them without authorization from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The movement spread rapidly &mdash; from Picardy to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, then to Brabant, Hainault, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Soon an army of 30,000 men was formed, carrying a banner on which was depicted the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> appearing to the Master of Hungary. The movement was equally successful in the towns, and the citizens of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a> furnished provisions to the army. However the Pastoureaux soon showed themselves hostile to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, especially to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>, whom they accused of having induced St. Louis to go to Palestine. Moreover, a host of idlers, robbers, cut-throats, and fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> joined their ranks, and thenceforth with growing audacity they slew <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and preached against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Blanche of Castile seems to have imagined that she could send the Pastoureaux to the relief of St. Louis, and summoning the master to her she questioned him and dismissed him with gifts.

<p>Emboldened by this reception the Pastoureaux entered <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and the grand-master, wearing a <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, preached from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of St. Eustache. Clerics and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were hunted, slain, and thrown into the Seine, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was insulted, and the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> was compelled in its own defence to close the Petit-Pont between the Cit&eacute; and the left bank of the Seine. The Pastoureaux then left <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and divided into several armies which spread terror everywhere. At Rouen the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were expelled from the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (4 June, 1251). At Orl&eacute;ans a large number of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were killed and thrown into the Loire (11 June). At Tours the Pastoureaux took by storm the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> the churches. The credulous populace regarded them as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and brought them the sick to be cured. At last Blanche of Castile realized that she had been mistaken and commanded the royal officers to arrest and destroy them. When they reached Bourges the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had fled, whereupon they seized the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, sacked the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and pillaged the city. An attempt was made to imprison them, but they broke down the gates. A troop of citizens pursued and halted them near Villeneuve-sur-Cher. The Master of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> was slain, together with a large number of his followers. Some reached the valley of the Rh&ocirc;ne and even <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>; others went to <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, whence they were driven by Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester and Governor of Guienne in the name of the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, who caused their leader to be thrown into the Gironde.

<p>Another leader went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and assembled some shepherds who, learning that the Pastoureaux were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, killed him. Henry II ordered the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports to take measures to prevent their invasion of his kingdom. Some of them submitted, and after having received the Cross at the hands of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> set out for the Holy Land. Ecclesiastical chroniclers assert that the Pastoureaux had concluded with the sultan a secret treaty to subject <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>. "It is said that they have resolved first to exterminate the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from the face of the earth, then to suppress the religious, and finally to fall upon the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> and nobles in order that the country thus deprived of defence may more easily be delivered up to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and incursions of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>" (Letter from the Guardian of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> to his brethren at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>; Chartularium Univ. Parisiensis, Paris, 1889, I, 225). This is obviously a fable, but as a matter of fact this popular movement, sincere and somewhat mystical in origin, soon acquired an anarchistic character.

<p>The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the second movement of the Pastoureaux in 1320 during the reign of Philip V. In the north of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> a suspended <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and unfrocked <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> preached the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> to a band of peasants, thundering against the indifference of the king and the nobles with regard to the deliverance of Palestine. As in 1251, the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> mystics were soon joined by ruffians of every description whose object was to profit by their simplicity. Clad in rags and armed with sticks and knives they marched on <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, liberated the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> in the Ch&acirc;telet, and defied the king, who merely intrenched himself in the palace of the Cit&eacute; and in the Louvre. From <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> they went to Berry, thence to Saintonge and Aquitaine to the number of 40,000, pillaging as they went. At Verdun-sur-Garonne five hundred <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in a dungeon strangled one another so as not to fall into their hands. They were often aided by the people of the cities and even the middle-class citizens applauded the massacre of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. In reply to the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">papal excommunication</a> they marched to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and then resolved to embark like St. Louis at Aigues-Moretes. But the Seneschal of <a href="../cathen/03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a> assembled his men at arms, closed the gates of the city against them, and drove them into the neighbouring marshes, where hunger dispersed them. The soldiers then organized hunting parties which resulted in the hanging of thousands of the Pastoureaux, but for a long time a number of their bands continued to lay waste the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.
