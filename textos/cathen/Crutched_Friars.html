<h1>Crutched Friars</h1>  

<p>(Or Crossed Friars).

<p>An order of <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant friars</a> who went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the thirteenth century from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where they existed for some time, and where they were called <em>"Fratres Cruciferi"</em> (see below). There first appearance in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was at a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13102a.htm">Diocese of Rochester</a> in 1244, when they presented documents from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and asked to be allowed to settle in the country (Matthew <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>). Each <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a> carried in his hand a wooden staff surmounted by a cross and also had a cross of red cloth upon his habit, from which circumstances originated the name by which they became commonly known. Their rule was that of St. Augustine and their habit originally brown or black, was later on changed to blue by <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a>. They established eight or nine houses in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the first being at either Colchester (according to Dugdale), or at Reigate (according to Reyner), founded in 1245.They settled in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> in 1249, where they gave their name to the locality, near Tower Hill, still called "Crutched Friars". Other houses were at Oxford (1348), <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, Great Weltham (Suffolk), Barham (a cell to Gt. Weltham), Wotten-under-Edge (Gloucestershire), Brackley (Northants) and Kildale (Yorkshire).
<h2><em>Fratres cruciferi</em></h2>

<p>The origin of these <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> is somewhat uncertain. They claimed to have been founded in the East, in the first century, by <a href="../cathen/04054a.htm">St. Cletus</a>, and to have been reconstituted by St. Cyriacus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in the fourth. It is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when they came to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but they were certainly there in the twelfth century, for in 1169 <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a> gave them constitutions and a rule of life similar to that of the Augustinians. <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a> prescribed for them a blue habit and substituted a small silver cross for the larger wooden one they had hitherto been accustomed to carry in their hands. It was from this custom that they obtained their name. Their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were at one time numerous in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, numbering two hundred and eight, divided into five provinces: Bologna, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of S. Maria di Morella at Bologna was made chief house of the order by <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Pope Clement IV</a>, and it was from this that the English Crutched Friars came. In later times corruptions were allowed to creep in, and from that and other causes their numbers dwindled down to no more than fifty houses in 1656, when the order was suppressed by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Pope Alexander VII</a>. A similar order of <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, known by the same name and like them claiming to come from the East, also existed in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the Low Countries, having been introduced or organized in 1211 by Th&eacute;odore de Celles. <a href="../cathen/07214a.htm">H&eacute;lyot</a> says their houses were numerous, but the order suffered extinction in the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. These <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> wore a black habit with a red cross upon it. Other <em>Fratres Cruciferi</em> were also to be found in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> in the thirteenth century and some said to have existed in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but there is practically no reliable information to be obtained about them.
