<h1>Crypt</h1>  

<p>(Or LOWER CHURCH).

<p>The word originally meant a hidden place, natural or artificial, suitable for the concealment of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or things. When visits to the burial-places without the walls of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> fell into disuse there ensued a curious change. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, no longer able to go out to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, brought the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> within the walls, and instead of building churches above the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, dug <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> under the churches in which the precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were deposited. This was the origin, first of the <em>confessio</em> of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, and, at a later period, of the crypt which answered the same purpose in the churches of the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. In this way the Romanesque crypt is the direct descendant of the <em>hypogoeum</em> or excavation of the early <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Christian catacomb</a>. The term <em>crypt</em> is sometimes used to signify the lower story of a two-storied building, e.g. the lower <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Sainte-Chapelle at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and, of the church San Francesco at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>; and in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the overground ground crypt of St. Ethelredra's Chapel in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> which is all that remains of the great episcopal palace called Ely Place.

<p>The crypt has a long and venerable history. What was done at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> set a precedent for <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> in general. There is an early example of a crypt at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, at Sant' Apollinare in Classe (534). At first crypts were sometimes as deepsunk as the <em>cubicula</em> of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> themselves, e.g. in Saint-Germain, at Auxerre, and in the Chartres <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Or they were but partly above ground, and were lighted by small windows windows placed in their side walls, e.g. Ernulph's crypt at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. Occasionally their floor was but little below the surface of the ground, as in the eastern crypt at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>; or it was on a level with the pavement of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/13449c.htm">San Miniato</a>, Florence In these latter cases the crypt practically became a second or lower church, e.g. St. Faith's, under old St. Paul's, London. Such a crypt, however, entailed a raised choir; hence it is that one ascends high flights of steps to such choirs as those of <a href="../cathen/13449c.htm">San Miniato</a>, Rochester, <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, etc. Almost all the crypts now found in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were built during the Norman period, or very early, in the pointed style, That at <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, however, belongs to the perfected style of thirteenth century. Here the crypt extends under and beyond the whole choir. Had there been an opening in the centre of the vault (and it is by no means clear that one was not originally intended), it would be more like a German double church than anything found in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The earliest crypts in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> are those of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a> and Ripon. In eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries crypts developed into magnificent churches, like those of Gloucester, Rochester, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>, <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, Saintes, <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, Holy, Trinity at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a> and <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>.
