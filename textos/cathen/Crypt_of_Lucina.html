<h1>Crypt of Lucina</h1>  

<p>The traditional title of the most ancient section of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of St. Callistus. According to the theory of <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, St. Lucina (honoured at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 30 June), after whom this portion of the cemetery is called, was the original donor of the area, and at the same time identical with the noble Roman matron, Pomponia Graecina, wife of the conqueror of Britain, Aulus Plautius. Lucina is believed to have been the <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> of Pomponia Graecina. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi's</a> hypothesis, which is generally accepted, rests on a passage of the "Annals" of Tacitus (XIII, xxxii), and on certain inscriptions discovered in the Crypt of Lucina. According to Tacitus, "Pomponia Graecina, a distinguished lady, wife of the Plautius who on his return from Britain received an ovation, was accused of some foreign <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, and handed over to her husband's judicial decision. Following ancient precedent, he heard his wife's cause in the presence of kinsfolk, involving, as it did, her legal status and character, and he reported that she was innocent. This Pomponia lived a long life of unbroken melancholy. After the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Julia, Drusus's daughter, by Messalina's treachery, for forty years she wore only the attire of a mourner with her heart ever sorrowful. For this, during the reign of Claudius, she escaped unpunished, and it was afterwards counted a glory to her." The "foreign <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>" of the Roman historian is now generally regarded as probably identical with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. When de Rossi first conjectured that this might be the case, he announced his view merely as a more or less remote probability, but subsequent discoveries in the cemetery of St. Callistus confirmed his supposition in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiest</a> manner. The first of these discoveries was the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of a <em>Pomponius Grekeinos</em>, evidently a member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Pomponia, and possibly her descendant; the inscription dates from about the beginning of the third century. A short distance from this, the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of a Pomponius Bassus was also found &mdash; another member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to which belonged the mysterious lady of the reign of Claudius. Thus the conversion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of this noble lady is established with a degree of probability that approaches <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>.
