<h1>Culm</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in the north-eastern part of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, founded in 1234, suffragan to Gnessen. The territory on the Vistula and Baltic, which the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> had obtained partly by gift and partly by conquest, was divided in this year by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, William <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, into the four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Culm, <a href="../cathen/05522a.htm">Ermland</a>, Pomesanien, and Samland; in 1255 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Riga became the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The Bishopric of Culm embraced the province of Culm, that is, the land between Vistula, Drewenz, and Ossa rivers, and in addition, the city of L&ouml;bau and its surrounding district. <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Pope Innocent IV</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Heidenreich (1245; died 1263). Originally the seat of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was Culmsee, where Heidenreich began in 1254, the construction of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> possessed the highest authority, both spiritual and secular, in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; he was the ruler of the land, but was in some measure dependent on the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>. During the episcopate of the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, founded in 1251, followed the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, but the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Friedrich of Hausen (1264-74), allowed the chapter to enter the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, taking its endowment with it. Not only was Friedrich a member of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> but most of his successors in the episcopal office until 1466 also belonged to it. Under the powerful protection of the Knights rapid progress was made in cultivating the soil and in Christianizing the inhabitants. many flourishing communities and numerous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and churches were founded, an excellent system of courts was provided, and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> orders were introduced. As early as the reign of the seventh <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Otto (1324-49), who was a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, there were 113 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 538 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The most celebrated <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were the "Johannes" <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Thorn and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Culm; the latter was changed in 1473 into a <em>studium particulare</em> and had celebrated professors, among whom were Johannes Dantiscus, Eobanus Hessus, etc.

<p>On account of its close connexion with the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was involved in the disputes of the order with <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. By the second Treaty of Thorn, 1466, the order was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to cede the province of Culm, with other territories, to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was now reconstructed as a secular diocese, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were named by the kings of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and nobles only were appointed as members of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a> and <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> found many adherents in the Diocese of Culm in the fifteenth century, and thus the ground was prepared for the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">religious revolution</a> of the sixteenth. In the larger towns especially, such at Danzig, Elbing, and Thorn, the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> won numerous supporters, against whom the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Johannes IV Konopacki (1508-30), showed himself lacking in moral force. It was only through the exertions of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who had remained loyal, that King Sigismund I took more severe measures against the innovations. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and spiritual-minded Johann V von H&ouml;fen, generally called Dantiscus (1530-38), laboured to maintain the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, as did also Tiedemann Giese (1538-49), the friend of <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Stanislaus Hosius</a> (1549-51), who, after an episcopate of two years, was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/05522a.htm">See of Ermland</a>. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> took firm root in Thorn, Graudenz, Marienburg, and other towns. Peter I Kostka (1574-95) was the reformer of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; through his efforts, a provincial council was held at <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> at which the Diocese of Culm was placed under the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> control of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, the Archbishopric of Riga having been suppressed in 1566. Kostka also held a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod at Culm in 1583, <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, reformed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and introduced the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1593. The preservation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as well as the reconquest of many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that had gone astray, was due to the effective labours of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and of the orders which were successfully re-established.

<p>The fall of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> brought the diocese into new relations. In 1772, in consequence of the first Partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, it came under the control of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, to which, with a short interruption (1807-15), it has ever since belonged. Under <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> auspices <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> again increased largely in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; in 1772, the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were confiscated, and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> colonists were settled throughout the province. In this way, and also on account of the confusion of the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> era, the diocese fell into decay. For lack of proper residence, the forty-ninth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Franz Xaver Count Wrbna-Rydzynski, was only once in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. After his death the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was vacant for ten years, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered by the coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Nalecz Wilkxycki. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De salute animarum", 1821, which provided for the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, gave Culm new boundaries; to the old diocese were added parts of the Dioceses of Leslau, <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, <a href="../cathen/12166b.htm">Plock</a>, and of the former Diocese of Pomesanian. In 1824 the seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the chapter was fixed at Pelplin, where it still remains. The new diocese suffered above all from the lack of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the supression of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the poverty of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. Bishop Ignatius Matthy (1824-32) bent all his energies to the founding of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Anastasius Sedlag (1834-56) made it his aim to give the diocese a uniform administration, to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> still remaining to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> after its great losses, to promote the development of a capable <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and to increase the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In the same way Johannes Nepomuk von der Marwitz (1857-86) devoted his entire attention to the founding of new cures and the reorganization of the old <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Unfortunately the diocese suffered greatly during the ecclesiatical struggle (<em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>) with the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government. After peace had been restored the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> prospered again under Leo Redner (1886-98) and Augustinus Rosentreter (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 9 July, 1899). In this period the diocese in some measure recovered from its losses, the supressed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> have been refilled with religious, and the new institutions of learning under supervision of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have been founded. However, it still suffers from the effects of its earlier losses, and from the lack of labourers in the vineyard of the Lord.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The present Diocese of Culm includes the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> province of West <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> with the exception of five Government districts; it also includes two districts of East Prussia, two of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, and that of Bromberg, belonging to Posen. The see embraces altogether 409 square miles. In 1900 it had a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 769,166 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; in 1907, 780,000. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter is composed of two dignitaries, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dean, and eight <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>. In 1907 there were 4 episcopal commissariats, 27 deaneries, 275 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 476 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 275 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 77 dependent churches, 9 other churches, and 37 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. Institutions of learning under religious control are: the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Pelplin with 5 professors; the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys with 12 <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> teachers; the episcopal houses of studies at Clum, Konitz, and Neustadt. In the three towns just mentioned the gymnasia are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in character. The diocese also possesses 4 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for teachers, and 2 higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls. Orders for men have not existed in the diocese since the religious struggle (<em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>) with the Government. The orders and congregations for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> devote their attention almost exclusively to the care of the sick, the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the children; but they are not permitted to give elementary instruction. In 1906 the orders and congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> religious were: <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, 6 houses with 102 religious; <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Sisters of Mercy of St. Charles Borromeo</a>, 2 houses with 39 religious, <a href="../cathen/05388a.htm">Sisters of St. Elizabeth</a>, 12 houses with 103 religious; Sisters of St. Francis, 2 houses with 22 religious. These religious have under their care 11 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and asylums, 8 day-nurseries, 1 housekeeping <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, 1 institution for sick and old religious, 1 home for servants, 1 reform institution for girls, 4 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and 12 stations for visiting nurses.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, formerly a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, is the most important church building of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; it is a brick Gothic structure with three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, was erected in the fourteenth century, and completely restored, 1849-99. Other churches of note are: the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Clumsee, built 1254-94 and used as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> until 1824; the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Culm, built in 1223; the churches of St. John, St. James, and St. Mary, all three erected in the thirteenth or fourteenth century. The most frequented places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are Maria-Lonk near Neumark (the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> picture of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> is now in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Neumark), and Mount Calvary near Neustadt with twenty-four <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>.
