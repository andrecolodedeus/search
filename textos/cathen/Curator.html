<h1>Curator</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>curare</em>).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> legally appointed to administer the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of another, who is unable to undertake its management himself, owing to age or physical incompetence, bodily or <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a>. Curators are often confounded with tutors, but they differ in many respects. Tutors are appointed principally for the guardianship of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and only secondarily for the care of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; while curators are deputed mainly and sometimes solely for temporal concerns and only incidentally as guardians of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Besides, a tutor is appointed for minors, while a curator may have charge of incompetent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of any age. Finally, a tutor cannot be commissioned for a particular or determined <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, though a curator may receive such an appointment. When the ward of a tutor has reached his majority, the tutor may become curator until the ward is twenty-five years of age, but he cannot be compelled to undertake such a charge. Curators, according to law, are to be constituted for those who are mentally weak, for prodigals, and those addicted inordinately to gambling. The administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> cannot, however, be taken from a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> merely because he lives luxuriously. Curators may also be appointed for captives, for the absent, and the deaf and dumb. A husband may not be constituted curator for his wife. Before the curator enters upon the administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, he is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give proper bond for his fidelity. Whatever salary he receives must be determined by a judge. If he did not demand a salary at the beginning of his administration, but later requests one, the judge is to fix the amount of such salary only for the future, not for the past. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a curator to render an account of his administration after the time of wardship has passed constitutes an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> impediment to entrance into the religious state until such <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> has been duly discharged. As regards the administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, curators are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take such care of it as would a diligent parent. They are therefore to see that the rents are collected, that the yearly income be not lessened, that less useful goods be sold, and that money be not allowed to lie idle. In case the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the ward suffer by the administration of the curator, the latter is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to make restitution, if the deterioration was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by culpable negligence on his part.
