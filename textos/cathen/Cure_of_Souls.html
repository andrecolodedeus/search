<h1>Cure of Souls</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>cura animarum</em>), technically, the exercise of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> office involving the instruction, by sermons and admonitions, and the sanctification, through the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, of the faithful in a determined district, by a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> legitimately a ppointed for the purpose. Those specially having cure of souls are the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the entire <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in their respective <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Others may likewise have part in the cure of souls in subordination to these. Thus in missionary countries where espiscopal sees have not yet been erected, those who labour for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are in a special manner sharers of the particular responsibility of the Vicar of Christ for those regions. In like manner, a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may have <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a> who attend to the wants of a particular portion of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, subordinate to himself. The object of the cure of souls is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men, and hence it is a continuation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mission on earth. As the Reedeemer established a church which was to govern, teach, and sanctify the world, it necessarily follows that those who are to assist in the work of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must obtain their mission from her alone. "How shall they preach, unless they be sent?" (<a href="../bible/rom010.htm#vrs15">Romans 10:15</a>).

<p>The canonical mission of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">Apostolic succession</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This succession is twofold: <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> and authority. The first is perpetuated by means of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; the latter by the living magistracy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which the head is the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who is the source of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Both elements enter into the mission of him who has cure of souls: <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, that he may offer sacrifice and administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which are the ordinary channels of sanctification employed by the Holy Ghost; and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, that he may teach correct <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, free his subjects from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and censures, and govern them in accordance with the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The power of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> is radically common to all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by virtue of the invalid ordination, but the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a> is ordinary only in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and extraordinary or delegated in others. It is plain, then, that while valid orders may exist outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> cannot, as its source is the Vicar of Christ and it is possessed only so far as he confers it or does not limit it. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of those who have cure of souls are all carefully defined in the sacred cannons. (see Pope; Bishop; Parish Priest.)

<p>We have here touched only upon what is common to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. It is plain that the closer the bond existing between the subordinate members of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and their superiors, and between <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and their people, the more effective will be the work done for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> be earnest in preaching and admonishing, unremitting in the tribunal of penance and visitation of the sick, charitable to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, kind yet firm in his dealings with all the members of his flock, observant of the regulations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as to his office and particularly that of dwelling among his people (see Residence, Ecclesiastical), that he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them and bring them succour at all times; and if, on the other hand, the people be truly desirous for their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, obedient towards their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> to obtain and employ the means of sanctification, and mindful of their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> as members of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> to enable their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> to institute and improve the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> institutions <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the proper furtherance of the object of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we shall have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the cure of souls as intended by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and as legislated for in the canons of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
