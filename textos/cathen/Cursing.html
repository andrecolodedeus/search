<h1>Cursing</h1>  

<p>In its popular acceptation cursing is often confounded, especially in the phrase "cursing and swearing", with the use of profane and insulting language; in canon law it sometimes signifies the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">ban of excommunication</a> pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In its more common Biblical sense it means the opposite of blessing (cf. <a href="../bible/num023.htm#vrs27">Numbers 23:27</a>), and is generally either a threat of the Divine wrath, or its actual visitation, or its prophetic announcement, though occasionally it is a mere petition that calamity may be visited by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or things in requital for wrongdoing. Thus among many other instances we find <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cursing the serpent (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs14">Genesis 3:14</a>), the earth (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs17">Genesis 3:17</a>), and Cain (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs11">Genesis 4:11</a>). Similarly <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> curses <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> (<a href="../bible/gen009.htm#vrs25">Genesis 9:25</a>); <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a>, him who should build the city of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> (<a href="../bible/jos006.htm#vrs26">Joshua 6:26-27</a>); and in various books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> there are long lists of curses against transgressors of the Law (cf. <a href="../bible/lev026.htm#vrs14">Leviticus 26:14-25</a>; <a href="../bible/deu027.htm#vrs15">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>, etc.). So, too, in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, Christ curses the barren fig-tree (<a href="../bible/mar011.htm#vrs14">Mark 11:14</a>), pronounces his denunciation of woe against the incredulous cities (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs21">Matthew 11:21</a>), against the rich, the worldling, the scribes and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and foretells the awful malediction that is to come upon the damned (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs41">Matthew 25:41</a>). The word curse is also applied to the victim of expiation for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs13">Galatians 3:13</a>), to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> temporal and eternal (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs17">Genesis 2:17</a>; <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs41">Matthew 25:41</a>).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, to curse is to call down <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or creatures, rational or irrational, living or dead. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> treats of it under the name <em>maledictio</em>, and says that imprecation may be made either efficaciously and by way of command, as when made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or inefficaciously and as a mere expression of desire. From the fact that we find many instances of curses made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his representatives, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Prophets, it is seen that the act of cursing is not necessarily <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> in itself; like other moral acts it takes its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> character from the object, the end, and the circumstances. Thus it is always a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the greatest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to curse <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for to do so involves both the irreverence of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and the malice of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the Divinity. It is likewise <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and consequently a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the Second Commandment, to curse creatures of any kind precisely because they are the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If, however, the imprecation be directed towards irrational creatures not on account of their relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but simply as they are in themselves, the guilt is no greater than that which attaches to vain and idle words, except where grave <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is given, or the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> wished to the irrational creature cannot be separated from serious loss to a <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creature, as would be the case were one to wish the death of another's horse, or the destruction of his house by fire, for such wishes involved serious violation of charity.

<p>Curses which imply rebellion against <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, or denial of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> or other attributes, such as curses of the weather, the winds, the world, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, are not generally grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because the full content and implication of such expressions is seldom realized by those who use them. The common imprecations against animate or inanimate objects which cause vexation or pain, those against enterprises which fail of success, so, too, the imprecations that spring from impatience, little outbreaks of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> over petty annoyances, and those spoken lightly, inconsiderately, under sudden impulse or in joke, are, as a rule, only venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> being slight and not seriously desired. To call down moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon a <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creature is always illicit, and the same holds good of physical <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unless it be desired not as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but only in so far as it is good, for example, as a punishment for misdeeds, or a means to amendment, or an obstacle to commission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for in such cases the principal intention, as <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> says, is directed per se towards what is good. When, however, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is wished another precisely because it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and with malice prepense, there is always <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the gravity of which varies with the seriousness of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; if it be of considerable magnitude, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will be grievous, if of trifling character, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will be venial. It is to be noted that merely verbal curses, even without any desire of fulfilment, become grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> when uttered against and in the presence of those who are invested with special claims to reverence. A child, therefore, would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> grievously who should curse father, mother, or grandfather, or those who hold the place of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in his regard, provided he does so to their very face, even though he does this merely with the lips and not with the heart. Such an act is a serious violation of the virtue of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Between other degrees of kindred verbal curses are forbidden only under pain of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. To curse the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is not of itself a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; to curse the dead is not ordinarily a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because no serious injury is done them, but to curse the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or holy things, as the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, is generally <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, as their relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is generally perceived.
