<h1>Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury</h1>  

<p>Date of birth not known; died 25 October, 758. He is first heard of as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Liminge, Kent. Consecrated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by Archbishop Nothelm, he succeeded Wahlstod in the <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">See of Hereford</a> in 736 and was translated to Canterbury about 740. Journeying to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he received the palladium, and on his return assisted at the Council of Cloveshoe in 742. At this council Ethelbald, King of Mercia, confirmed many privileges to churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. His friendship with <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, accounts for the intimate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> had of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life of Ethelbald, which prompted the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> to correspond with the king in the hope of inducing him to reform. Cuthbert, in obedience to the wish of Pope Zachary, called a second Council of Cloveshoe, in 747, which formulated many canons for the guidance of monastic life and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. It especially insisted on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction being given in the English tongue. The proceedings of this council were sent to <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> and prompted him to act similarly in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Some have thought that <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> took the initiative and not Cuthbert, but most now admit that the proceedings in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> for promoting a greater union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> took place after this council of Cloveshoe and in imitation of it.

<p>Cuthbert brought about a great change with regard to the precedence of the Cathedral Church of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. Christ Church, <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, was considered inferior in dignity to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul where all the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> granted his request for the interment of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> at Christ Church and King Eadbert confirmed this. A <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was the built at the east end of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dedicated to <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> to serve as the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>, the court of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and their place of burial. Fearing opposition from the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul's church Cuthbert was stealthily buried in the new <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> several days before his death was generally known. From that time until the Conquest at least, every <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> except one was buried at Christ Church. A letter of his to Lullus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, is still extant and also two short poems preserved by <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a>. Leland speaks of a volume of his epigrams in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of Malmesbury Abbey. This volume is now lost.
