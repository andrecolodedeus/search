<h1>Cuthbert Tunstall</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, later of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, b. at Hackforth, Yorkshire, in 1474; d. at Lambeth Palace, 18 Nov., 1559. He studied both at Oxford and Cambridge, finally graduating LL.D. at Padua. Being an accomplished scholar both in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and law, as well as in Greek and Hebrew, he soon won the friendship of <a href="../cathen/15554a.htm">Archbishop Warham</a>, who on 25 Aug., 1511, made him his chancellor, and shortly after <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Harrow-on-the-Hill. He became successively a canon of Lincoln (1514) and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a> (1515). He began his diplomatic career as ambassador at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, in conjunction with <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a>, and there he lodged with <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, becoming the intimate friend of both of them. Further preferments and embassies fell to his lot, till in 1522 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> provision. On 25 May, 1523, he became keeper of the privy seal; but neither the work this entailed nor fresh embassies prevented him from making a visitation of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. A visit to Worms (1520-1) had opened his eyes to the dangers of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran movement</a> and the evils arising from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> literature. In the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> question Tunstall acted as one of Queen Katherine's counsel, but he endeavoured to dissuade her from appealing to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 21 Feb., 1529-30, he was translated by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to the more important See of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, a step which involved the assumption of quasi-regal power and authority within the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> (see <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">ANCIENT CATHOLIC DIOCESE OF DURHAM</a>). During the troubled years that followed, Tunstall was far from imitating the constancy of <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">[St. John] Fisher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">[St. Thomas] More</a>, yet he ever held to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and practices. He adopted a policy of passive obedience and acquiescence in many matters with which he could have had no sympathy. With regard to the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, the king's <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> so feared his influence that they prevented his attendance at Parliament.

<p>In 1537 Tunstall was given the onerous position of President of the Council of the North, and Scottish affairs occupied much of his attention. Towards the end of Henry's reign he twice was sent on diplomatic business to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Under the protectorate of Somerset his religious position became very difficult, but he yielded so far in compliance to the new changes that Gardiner protested. But the lengths to which the reformers went opened his eyes to the real significance of the royal supremacy; a change came over his attitude, and he staunchly maintained the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, steadily opposing the abolition of chantries, the Act of Uniformity, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> permitting <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to marry. He seems to have hoped that Warwick might be induced to reverse the anti-Catholic policy of Somerset, but this hope soon failed, and in 1551 he was summoned to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and confined to his house there. During this captivity he composed his treatise, "De Veritate Corporis et Sanguinis Domini nostri Jesu Christi in Eucharistia", published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1554. At the end of 1551 he was removed to the Tower, and a bill for his deprivation was introduced. When this failed, he was tried by a commission (4-5 Oct., 1552) and deprived of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. On Mary's accession he was liberated, and his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, which had been dissolved by Act of Parliament in March, 1553, was re- established by a further Act in April, 1554. Through Mary's reign he, being now an octogenarian, ruled his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in peace, taking little part either in public affairs or in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; but on the accession of Elizabeth his firmness in resisting the fresh innovations marked him out for the royal displeasure. He declined to take the <a href="../cathen/11177a.htm">oath of supremacy</a>, was summoned to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and when ordered to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> Parker refused to do so. Shortly afterwards he was deprived of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> (28 Sept., 1559) and committed to Parker's care as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at Lambeth Palace, where within a few weeks he died. He thus became one of the eleven confessor-bishops who died <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> for the Faith.

<p>His works, exclusive of published letters and sermons, are: "De Arte Supputandi Libri IV" (London, 1522); "Confutatio cavillationum quibus SS. Eucharistiae Sacramentum ab impiis Caphernaitis impeti solet" (Paris, 1552); "De veritate Corporis et Sanguinis Domini in Eucharistia Libri II" (Paris, 1554); "Compendium in decem libros ethicorum Aristotelis" (Paris, 1554); "Certaine godly and devout prayers made in Latin by C. Tunstall and translated into Englishe by Thomas Paynelle, Clerke" (London, 1558). Much of his political correspondence is preserved in the British Museum. Despite his weakness under <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, we may endorse the verdict of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> historian, Pollard, who writes (op. cit. inf.): "Tunstall's long career of eighty-five years, for thirty-seven of which he was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, is one of the most consistent and honourable in the sixteenth century. The extent of the religious revolution under Edward VI <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to reverse his views on the royal supremacy and he refused to change them again under Elizabeth."
