<h1>Cynic School of Philosophy</h1>  

<p>The Cynic School, founded at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> about 400 B.C., continued in existence until about 200 B.C. It sprang from the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> regarding the necessity of moderation and self-denial. With this <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> element it combined the <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> and rhetorical methods of the Eleatics and the <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">Sophists</a>. Both these influences, however, it perverted from their primitive uses; the <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socratic</a> ethics was interpreted by the Cynics into a coarse and even vulgar depreciation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, refinement, and the common decencies, while the methods of the Eleatics and the <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">Sophists</a> became in the hands of the Cynics an instrument of contention (Eristic Method) rather than a means of attaining <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The Cynic contempt for the refinements and conventions of polite <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is generally given as the reason for the name <em>dogs</em> (<em>k&uacute;nes</em>) by which the first representatives of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were known. According to some authorities, however, the name <em>Cynic</em> arose from the fact that the first representatives of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were accustomed to meet in the gymnasium of Cynosarges.

<p>The founder of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was Antisthenes, an Athenian who was born about 436 B.C., and was a pupil of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>. The best known among his followers are Diogenes of <a href="../cathen/14014b.htm">Sinope</a>, Crates, Menedemus, and Menippus. Antisthenes himself seems to have been a serious thinker and a writer of ability. In his theory of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he advocated individualistic sensism as opposed to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> intellectualistic theory of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; that is to say, he taught that the sense-perceived individual alone exists and that there are no universal objects of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. In ethics he maintained that virtue is the only good and that pleasure is always and under all conditions an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Self-control, he said, is the essence of virtue, and a wise man will learn above all things to despise material needs and the artificial comforts in which worldly men find <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p>Diogenes, generally referred to as "Diogenes the Cynic", is one of the most striking figures in Greek history; at least, his <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> with its eccentricities, its coarse humour, its originality, and its defiance of the commonplace, has appealed with extraordinary force to the popular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. His interview with Alexander, of which the simplest version is to be found in Plutarch, was greatly exaggerated by subsequent tradition. The followers of Diogenes, namely, Crates, Menedemus, and Menippus, imitated all his eccentricities and so exaggerated the anti-social elements in the Cynic system that the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> finally fell into disrepute. Nevertheless, there were in the Cynic philosophy elements, especially the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> element, which later became a source of genuine inspiration in the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> School. This element, combined with the broader <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the usefulness of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> culture and the more enlightened <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> concept of the scope of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> discussion, reappeared in the philosophy of <a href="../cathen/15756b.htm">Zeno</a> and Cleanthes, and was the central <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the last great system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in Greece.
