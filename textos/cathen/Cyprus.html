<h1>Cyprus</h1>  

<p>An island in the Eastern Mediterranean, at the entrance of the Gulf of Alexandretta. It was originally inhabited by <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a> and Greeks, and was famous for its <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> of Aphrodite. Though long autonomous, in the sixth century B.C. dominion over it was disputed by the Egyptians and the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, the latter ruling it till the invasion of Alexander the Great. From the Ptolemies of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> it passed to the Romans (59 B.C.). Despite <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> invasions from the seventh to the tenth century, it remained a part of the Eastern Empire until the end of the twelfth. ln 1191 it was conquered by <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard the Lion-Hearted</a>, who gave it to Guy de Lusignan, King of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; in 1373 it fell to the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>, in 1489 to the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>. Finally, in 1571, it became <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> territory under Sultan Selim II. In 1878 it was occupied by <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and is now administered by an English high commissioner, assisted by a board of four English members (Statesman's Year Book, London, 1908). The island is hilly, with few rivers, and the climate is hot. Its once famous cities have perished; the chief towns are now Larnaca (the best port), <a href="../cathen/11071c.htm">Nicosia</a>, and Limasol. Its area is 153,584 square miles. The population in 1901 was 237,000 (51,000 <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, 1100 <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, 850 Latins, 300 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, a few <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the rest Greeks). It produces dates, carobs, oranges and other fruits, oil, wine, and corn. It has also sponge fisheries. Gypsum is mined there and copper mines were worked in ancient times. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was successfully preached in Cyprus by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, St. Barnabas (a native of the island), and St. John Mark. At Paphos the magician Elymas was blinded and the Proconsul Sergius Paulus was converted (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs13">Acts 11:13-15</a>). The Byzantine "Synaxaria" mention many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of this early period, e.g. St. Lazarus, St. Heraclides, St. Nicanor (one of the first seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>), and others. In the fourth century we find two illustrious names, that of St. Spiridion, the shepherd <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Trimithus, present at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> in 325 with two other Cypriot <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were removed to Corf&ugrave; in 1460, and that of <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (d. 403), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> adversary of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and author of many valuable <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a> (later Constantia) was then <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the whole island, but was himself subject to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> quarrels and the Eustathian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, the Cypriote Church began to claim its independence. <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a> stood out for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Antiochene patriarch, Alexander I. However, it was not long before the Council of Ephesus (431) in its seventh session acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> independence of Cyprus: the cause was gained by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, Rheginus, who was present at Ephesus with three of his suffragans. In 488 Peter the Dyer (Petrus Fullo), the famous <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> patriarch, made an effort to recover the ancient Antiochene <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the island. During the conflict, however, the Cypriote <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, Anthimus, claimed to have learned by a revelation that the site of the sepulchre of St. Barnabas was quite near his own city of <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a>; he found there the body of the Apostle with a copy of St. Matthew's Gospel, brought the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to Constantinople, and presented them to the Emperor Zeno. <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacius of Constantinople</a> decided in favour of Cyprus against Antioch, since which time the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> independence (<em>autocephalia</em>) of the island has no more been called in question, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, known as <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, ranking immediately after the five great <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>.

<p>From the fifth to the twelfth century the following <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/04294a.htm">Constantia</a> (Salamis) are worthy of note: Acadius, biographer of St. Symeon Stylites the Younger, and an uncompromising opponent of the Ecthesis of Heraclius (q.v.); Sergius, who condemned this document in a council and sent the pertinent <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to Pope Theodore I, but became afterwards infected with the very <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> he had formerly condemned; George, a defender of the <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">holy images</a> (icons); Constantine, who played a conspicuous part in their defence at the Second Nicene Council (787); Nicholas Muzalon, appointed <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople in 1147. Another remarkable <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> is St. Demetrianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chytraea (ninth and tenth century). After the conquest of Cyprus by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, 632-647, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population with its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the mainland. Justinian II built for them, near the Hellespont, a city which he called Nea Justinianopolis; their <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> enjoyed there the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> he had in Cyprus, besides exercising <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the surrounding country (<a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Quinisext Council</a>, can. xxxix, 692). After the death of Justinian II the Cypriotes returned to their island with their <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Under Nicephorus Phocas (963-969) Cyprus was freed completely from the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, who had sometimes treated it more kindly than the Byzantine emperors. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, however, gained by the restoration. To this period belongs the foundation of three great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, Our Lady of Pity (Eleusa) of Kykkos, Machaeras, and the Encleistra, the last founded in the twelfth century by the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> Neophytus, author of several <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> rule, though at first accepted rather willingly, was finally the source of profound disturbance. In 1196 King Amaury obtained from <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> a Latin <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> for his kingdom: a resident <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was placed at <a href="../cathen/11071c.htm">Nicosia</a> (Leucosia), with three suffragans at <a href="../cathen/11457b.htm">Paphos</a>, Limasol (Temessos), and Famagusta (Ammochostos, formerly Arsinoe). <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Regular Canons</a>, <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> soon had many flourishing <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Splendid churches were built in the Gothic or ogival style, and many Greek churches were changed into Latin ones. Ecclesiastical revenues were assigned (in part) to the Latin <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were subordinated to Latin <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. In the execution of the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215) Cardinal Pelagius, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, showed himself utterly intransigent. Thirteen refractory Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were cruelly <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. The Greek <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Neophytus, was deposed and exiled, the Greek sees reduced to four, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> ordered to reside in small villages and obey the Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (1220-1222). <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> were more favourable to the Greeks (Hergenr&ouml;ther-Kirsch, Kirchengesch., 4th ed., 1904, II, 726), and the Government often defended them against the Latins. The <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of Cyprus during this sad period is one of conflict between the two rival communions, the Greeks being always looked on as more or less <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> both by the Latins and by the Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. An attempted union of the two Churches in 1405 did not succeed, nor was the Union of Florence (1439) more lasting. In 1489, through the abdication of Queen Caterina Cornaro, the island became subject to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, whose rule was even more intolerable to the Greeks, so that, as stated, in 1571 they welcomed the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> conquerors as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> deliverers.

<p>Among the more conspicuous Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11071c.htm">Nicosia</a> may be mentioned Eustorge de Montaigu (1217-1250) who died at the siege of <a href="../cathen/04615b.htm">Damietta</a>, a stern defender of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his Church and a skilful administrator; he increased the splendour of the church services, established <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, built the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace and the magnificent <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Sophia; Ugo di Fagiano (1251-1261), distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> adversary of the Greeks; G&eacute;rard de Langres (1274), deposed by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> for siding with <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>; Giovanni del Conte (1312), renowned for his charity; Cardinal Elie de Nabinals (1332), a great reformer; <a href="../cathen/01474b.htm">Andreas of Rhodes</a> (1447), present at the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>; Filippo Mocenigo (1559), who assisted at the closing sessions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, helped the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and, after the loss of Cyprus, retired to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cyprus showed themselves generally worthy of their mission, by resisting the encroachments of the kings, sometimes also of the Latin Patriarchs of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and even of the pontifical <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. The only reproach they deserve is a want of tact in their behaviour towards the Greeks, and also that their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at certain times were guilty of moral laxity. Few <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> appear in Latin Cyprus; we hear only of the saintly <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Ugo di Fagiano, and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Pierre de La Palu, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and administrator of the See of Limasol. Blessed Pierre Thomas, a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, who strove hard to convert the Greeks, died at the siege of <a href="../cathen/05781b.htm">Famagusta</a> in 1366.

<p>After frightful massacres, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> allowed the Greeks to reorganize their Church as they liked: viz, with an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> styled "Most Blessed Archbishop of Nea Justiniana [a blunder for Justinianopolis] and all Cyprus", and three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/11457b.htm">Paphos</a>, Citium, and Karpasia. In the seventeenth century the last-named see was suppressed, and its territory given to the archdiocese; on the other hand the ancient See of Kyrenia was re-established. Cyprus, like the other autocephalous <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Churches, has its "Holy Synod", which consists of four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In the last three centuries there are few events to mention, apart from <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> elections and perpetual domestic quarrels. In 1668 Archbishop Nicephorus held a council against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. In 1821 the four Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. After 1900 strife arose in the ancient Church of St. Barnabas, and it was found impossible to name a successor to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> who died in that year. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> conquest caused the ruin of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>: two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were then killed with many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the churches were profaned, and the Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> left the island. However, as early as 1572, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> could again reside at Larnaca; after a century they had gathered about 2000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of various rites. Since 1848 Cyprus has been ecclesiastically dependent on the new Latin Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> have stations at Larnaca, Limasol, and Nicosia, with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and five churches; <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of the Apparition conduct <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in these three towns, and have a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> at Larnaca.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> were very numerous during the period of Latin rule, but owing to persecutions of Greeks or <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> have mostly all departed or <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>. The latter are called Linobambaci; some of them returned to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Cyprus, with a part of <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Lebanon</a>, still forms a <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> diocese, with 30,000 faithful. They have in the island a few churches and four <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but lack good <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (See <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">MARONITES</a>). Among the resident <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> there is only an insignificant number (12) of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; the rest obey the Gregorian <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and have two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a>, who lived in Cyprus during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, subject to their own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, have now completely disappeared.
