<h1>Cyril Sieni</h1>  

<p>(Better known as CYRIL OF BARCELONA).

<p>Missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, b. in <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. after 1799, place and exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> equally uncertain. He was a member of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Order</a>, and in 1772 was sent to <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Santiago, Jos&eacute; de Echeverria, within whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> Louisiana then was. Ecclesiastical and religious conditions were at that time very unsatisfactory. The mission was in charge of some <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> who were not always models of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> virtue; their superior, Dagobert, reputed to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and corrupt, had aroused against Cyril the opposition both of Unzaga, the civil governor, and the people. In the hope that a responsible episcopal authority would remove these obstacles, Father Cyril was made <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tricali, and auxiliary of Santiago. His delegated <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority extended over the seventeen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and twenty-one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> found in the territory now included in the States of Louisiana, <a href="../cathen/01240a.htm">Alabama</a>, <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>, and those bordering on the western bank of the Mississippi as far as the Missouri. In 1772 he sent to St. Louis, then a hamlet of about two hundred inhabitants, its second <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, Father Valentine. He also sent resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> (1781) to Pensacola and St. Augustine in <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>. During his administration, several <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> were sent to Bishop Sieni by Charles III of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, to minister to the religious needs of the English-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; to each of them the king assigned an annual salary of 350 dollars, besides paying their passage.

<p>In 1786 Sieni issued a pastoral letter concerning the proper observance of Sunday as a day of rest and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. In 1788 <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> was swept by a great conflagration, on which occasion the brick church of the city perished (it was rebuilt in 1794). In spite of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, religion made little progress: on the one hand he failed to restore <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, and on the other displeased both Charles III and Bishop Trespalacios of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>, to whose care the mission was committed since 1787. Finally a royal order (1793) banished him to his native province. In 1799 he was still in Havana on his way to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Irreligious writers of his own day, followed by some modern historians, depict him in harsh colours. He probably committed more than one administrative <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but he was esteemed a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and simple-minded ecclesiastic.
