<h1>Cyrus of Alexandria</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> patriarch of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in the seventh century, and one of the authors of <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>; d. about 641. He had been since 620 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Phasis in Colchis when the Emperor Heraclius, in the course of his Persian campaign (626), consulted him about a plan for bringing the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to the support of the empire. The plan, suggested by Sergius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, consisted of confessing the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Chalcedon on the two natures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while practically nullifying it by the admission of one theandric will and operation, <img alt="Image" src="../images/04597c01.gif">. Cyrus hesitated at first, but being assured by Sergius that this formula was opposed to neither the Fathers nor Chalcedon and was destined to achieve great results, he became a stanch supporter of it, and was, in return, raised by Heraclius to the then vacant <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">See of Alexandria</a> (630). Once a patriarch, he set himself vigorously to effect the desired union. In a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> he proposed what is known as the <img alt="Image" src="../images/04597c02.gif"> or "Satisfactio", an agreement in nine articles, the seventh of which is a bold assertion of the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite heresy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> (Theodosians or Severians) welcomed the agreement with, however, the remark that Chalcedon was coming to them, not they to Chalcedon. The union thus effected was adroitly exploited, with a view to win over Pope Honorius to <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>; otherwise it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> ineffective, and soon fell into discredit under the name of <img alt="Image" src="../images/04597c03.gif">, contemptuously called the "washy union". Cyrus persevered none the less in his adhesion to the compromise, and even accepted the Ecthesis, a new imperial formulary of the same <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> (637). When Omar's general, Amru, threatened the Prefecture of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Cyrus was made prefect and entrusted with the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Certain humiliating stipulations, to which he subscribed for the sake of peace, angered his imperial master. He was recalled and harshly accused of connivance with the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>; however, he was soon restored to his former authority, owing to the impending siege of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, but could not avert the fall of the great city (640) and died shortly after.

<p>From Cyrus we have three letters to Sergius and the "Satisfactio", all preserved in the acts of the Roman Synod of the Lateran and of the Sixth &OElig;cumenical Council (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, X, 1004; XI, 560, 562, 964). The first letter is an acceptation of the Ecthesis; in the second Cyrus describes his perplexity between Pope Leo and Sergius; the conversion of the Theodosians is narrated in the third. The seventh article of the "Satisfactio" &mdash; the others are irrelevant &mdash; reads thus: "The one and same Christ, the Son, performs the works proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to man by one theandric operation [<img alt="Image" src="../images/04597c04.gif">] according to St. Dionysius". Cyrus' chief opponents, St. Sophronius, d. in 637 (Epistola synodica, <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XI, 480), and St. Maximus, d. in 662 (Epistola ad Nicandrum; disputatio cum Pyrrho, P.G., XCI, 101, 345), reproached him for falsifying the then much-respected text of Dionysius and substituting <img alt="Image" src="../images/04597c05.gif"> for <img alt="Image" src="../images/04597c06.gif"> (new). They showed, moreover, the inanity of his claim to the support of the Fathers, and explained how the Divine and human natures of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, sometimes styled one, because they belong to the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and work in perfect harmony, can no more by physically identified than the natures from which they proceed. Historians are not agreed as to how Cyrus came by this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Some think that he was, from the outset, a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> at heart. Others, with more reason, hold that he was led into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by Sergius and Heraclius. Cyrus was condemned as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> in the Lateran Council of 649 (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion, 217, 219) and in 680 at the Third &OElig;cumenical Council of Constantinople (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 238; <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XI, 554).
