<h1>Czech Literature</h1>  

<p>The Czech or <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> language is spoken by that branch of the Indo-European <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> who settled in <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> about the fifth century after Christ. It is closely allied to the Russian, Polish, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> languages having a common origin. The evolution of Czech literature dates back to 863, when Moravia and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, through the efforts of Sts. Cyril and Methodius, the apostles of these two countries, were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and thus became participants in the great work of civilization. Of all <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> literature, with the exception of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a>, the Czech is the oldest and, until the seventeenth century, was also the richest. It may be divided into four periods.
<h3>First period</h3>

<p>This era extended from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianization</a> of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> to the appearance in public of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a>, in the year 1404. It may be called the childhood of Czech literature and is characterized by fruitfulness in poetry. From <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> times we have no literary relics, though it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> used certain crude characters or letters commonly called the runic. St. Cyril, using the Greek characters as a basis, devised a special <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> alphabet with new marks indicating soft sounds. At the same time he introduced a Slavonic Liturgy and translated part of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. The liturgy, however, was soon superseded by the Latin, written in the Latin language with Roman letters. This was brought about chiefly by the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who, it is said, feared that this Slavonic Liturgy might finally lead to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. The Slavonic Liturgy survived longest (until 1055) in the Abbey of Sazava. To re-establish it Emperor Charles I founded an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Prague commonly called "Na Slovanech", or at the present time Emmaus, inducing <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a> to settle there. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, however, were scattered during the Hussite <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in 1419 and did not return. The older part of the famous "Reims Gospel", it is claimed, dates from the eleventh or twelfth century. The newer part was written at <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a> in 1395, and is the only relic of Old Slavonic extant. This Gospel was carried away by the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, was taken as far as Turkey, and thence to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, where it was used by the French kings when pronouncing the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Of the oldest period, that is from the tenth to the twelfth century, only a few <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> have been preserved, among them two fragments of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> translations written in the <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> or Old Slavonic alphabet. The most precious relic of this period is the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Hospodine, pomiluj ny", a paraphrase of the <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">Kyrie Eleison</a>, which, with its deep choral melody, is very impressive. It is surpassed only by the beautiful song in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Wenceslaus.

<p>A marked improvement in Czech literature began in the year 1250. The Western lands gave birth to new watchwords, new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and new life. The splendour of tournaments, the pomp of feasts, and the grandeur of knighthood took the fancy of the age, while the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> widened the people's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of other countries and customs. The troubadours of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the minnesingers of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> went from castle to castle, glorifying heroic deeds of knighthood. Tendencies of this kind found favour also in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and because of their origin in Latin or Roman lands, literature of this period is commonly called romance, The deeds and adventures of the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> were extolled in song and poem after foreign models; the best of these was "Alexandreis", written by an unknown author. This piece of literature is remarkable for its almost faultless form and elegant diction. Another effect of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> was the extraordinary revival of religious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among the people, which gave rise to a new class of literature, to legends and to mystery or spiritual plays. In prose were written spiritual romances, legends, and passionals depicting the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> further enkindled in the hearts of many a desire to see and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> new lands and new peoples. This led to works on travel, geography, etc. in great numbers. The veneration of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Mother</a> developed rapidly and fostered a deeper respect for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children. The founding of the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">University of Prague</a>, in 1348, by Emperor Charles I was a mighty factor in the improvement of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> literature in all branches. The moral condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at that time cannot be called exemplary. There existed certain disorders which called forth reformers, who honestly and sincerely worked for their elimination. Numbers of devotional and moral tracts were written, the best of which were by Tom&aacute;s t&iacute;tn&yacute;, who fearlessly assailed the abuses wherever he found them. t&iacute;tn&yacute;'s literary activity also made its influence felt in another line. Up to this time the Czech language had been regarded as unfit for scientific writing, the Latin being almost exclusively used here, as in many other countries, for treatises on <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> subjects. t&iacute;tn&yacute;, however, dispelled this illusion, by using the Czech language even in his scientific writings, and thus created a rich scientific vocabulary. The last of these literary reformers was <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a>. He, however, allowed himself to be led astray by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">John Wyclif</a> and thus become the cause of unhappy dissensions and bloody <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in his native country.


<h3>Second period</h3>

<p>The appearance of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a> in 1404 marks the second period of Czech literature. During this the Czech language passed from its old form to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> stage, and this epoch may be called the golden age of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> literature. Devotional prose was in preponderance. The literary merit of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">John Hus</a> consists in his establishing a diacritical orthography, making the written language more simple and stable; but, on the other hand, his activity caused dissensions in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which brought on bloody <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and the ruin of literature. These sad conditions improved only during the reign of George of Podiebrad (1458-71). The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> known as the <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a>, founded in 1457, imparted a new character to Czech literature and produced many eminent writers. In religious meetings held in the fashion of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, spiritual reading, meditation, and religious songs formed the greater part of the services. The practice led to the publishing of a great number of devotional songs and hymn-books, and to the founding of printing establishments. Eight leading members of the Brethren translated from the original Hebrew and Greek the whole of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, which is generally known as the Kralick&aacute; Bible, from the town of Kralice in which it was printed. This translation is excellent and from a literary standpoint it must be called classical. The greatest writer of the Brethren was their last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Jan Amos Komensk&yacute; (Johann Amos, called Comenius), a pedagogue of renown, who, in his masterpiece, "The Labyrinth of the World and the Heart's <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>" &mdash; the best devotional and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> work in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> literature &mdash; proves that all worldly glory, riches, and pleasures are vanities and that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists only in the possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the fulfilling of His Commandments.

<p>Another important factor in Czech literature was <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>. As early as the reign of George of Podiebrad (1458-71) many writers turned their attention to the old Roman and Greek literatures. They studied the classics, copied the elegancies of form, and drew upon the verbal riches, many even going so far as to write their works in Latin. But two powerful obstacles stood in the way from the beginning. An article of Hussite <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> condemned the fostering of worldly <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and the members of the <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a> subscribed to this opinion. For this reason <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> was cultivated at first only by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Foremost in this movement must be mentioned the talented poet Bohuslav z Lobkovic and John Hodejovsk&yacute; from Hodejov, who, though not a writer, was a generous patron of literature. When <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> superseded Hussitism, John Blahoslav, a member of the <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a>, wrote an elaborate defence of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a>, and three religious bodies then began to emulate one another in fostering <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>: the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who had suffered greatly during the Hussite <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a>, who at this time were at the zenith of their literary development, and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, who were growing in force. New <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were founded, of which those conducted by the Brethren were foremost. These, however, were gradually superseded by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> indeed revived classic models of poetry, but it was destructive of home, that is Czech, literature, in that Humanistic poetry was exclusively Latin. At the same time it must be acknowledged that through the influence of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> prose vastly improved, culminating in the works of Daniel Adam of Veleslav&iacute;n, who rightly wrote: "The <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> language, in its present high development, is elegant, rich, graceful, and sublime, and perfectly adapted to the setting forth of any topic, whether in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> or philosophy." This splendid development terminated suddenly in 1620, at the beginning of the era of decline.
<h3>Third period</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> nobility, refusing to recognize Emperor Ferdinand II, chose the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> Elector Frederick V as their king (1619). This rebellion was overthrown at the battle of the White Mountain, 8 Nov., 1620, and the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> nation by the foolhardiness and stubbornness of its nobles was shorn of its independence. The victorious Ferdinand began to enforce the existing motto of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>: <em>Cuius regio illius religio</em>. Some of the leaders of rebellion were executed and their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> confiscated, and others were warned either to adopt the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion or to leave the land. Many left <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was sold or given to German, Spanish, French, or Italian nobles. After the battle of the White Mountain we meet but few writers. Most prominent amongst the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers of this day was Vilem Slavata of Chlum, who wrote a large history in refutation of that of Skala of Zhor which unduly favoured <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>, however, all literary activity ceased. During the whole of the seventeenth century there was not published a single original work of merit. In the eighteenth century works were written in Latin and German. The <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a> gradually took the place of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, and when, in 1774, <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> excluded it from the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and from all public offices, it looked as if the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> language was condemned to a gradual but sure death. But just here came a sudden change for the better, and 1780 marks the beginning of the modern period of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> literature.
<h3>Fourth period</h3>

<p>A handful of patriotic <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and teachers took up the heroic task of awakening the nation and succeeded. During the course of one century <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> literature grew to such proportions in all its branches that today it may well compare with the literature of other nations. Foremost among the pioneers of this era of resurrection must be mentioned Josef Dobrovsk&yacute;, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08566c.htm">Prof. Josef Jungman</a>.
