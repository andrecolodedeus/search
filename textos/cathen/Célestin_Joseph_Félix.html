<h1>C&eacute;lestin Joseph F&eacute;lix</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, b. at Neuville-sur-l' Escaut (Nord), 28 June 1810; d. at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, 7 July, 1891. He began his studies under the <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Brothers of Christian Doctrine</a>, going later to the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, where he completed his secondary studies. In 1833 he was named professor of rhetoric, received <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, and in 1837 entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. He began his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a> at Tronchiennes in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, continued it at Saint-Acheul, and ended it at Brugelettes, where he studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Having completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1842 and returned to Brugelettes to teach rhetoric and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. His earliest <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> discourses, preached at Ath, and especially one on <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> patriotism, soon won him a brilliant reputations for eloquence.

<p>Called to Amiens in 1850, he introduced the teaching of rhetoric at the College de la Providence and preaching during <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His oratorical qualities becoming more and more evident, he was called to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He first preached at St. Thomas d'Aquin in 1851, and in 1852 preached <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons at Saint-Germain-des-Pres, and those of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> at Saint-Sulpice. It was then that <a href="../cathen/13769a.htm">Mgr. Sibour</a> named him to succeed the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Father Lacordaire</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">Father de Ravignan</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of Notre-Dame (1853 to 1870). He became one of its brilliant orators. The conferences of the first three years have not been published in full. In 1856 P&egrave;re F&eacute;lix began the subject which he made the master-work of his life: "Progr&egrave;s par le Christianisme". This formed the matter of a series of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> conferences which are preserved for us in fifteen volumes, and which have lost none of their reality. True progress in all its forms, whether of the individual or of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, art, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, or government, is herein treated with great <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> exactness and breadth of view. The practical conclusions of these conferences P&egrave;re F&eacute;lix summed up every year in his preaching of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> retreat, which had been inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">P&egrave;re de Ravignan</a>. This was the side of his ministry which lay nearest his heart. While he was in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and especially during his stay at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> (1867-1883), and at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a> (1883-1891), the illustrious <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> spoke in nearly all the great <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. In 1881 he even went to Copenhagen to conduct the <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> exercises, and there he held a celebrated conference on authority. F&eacute;lix founded the Society of St. Michael for the distribution of good books and employed the leisure moments of his last years in the composition of several works and in the revision of his "Retraites a Notre-Dame", which he published in six volumes.

<p>The eloquence of P&egrave;re F&eacute;lix was characterised by clearness, vigorous <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, unction, and pathos, even in his reasoning. He lacked <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and the enthusiasm of <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, but he was more skilled in dialectic and surer in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. His diction was richer than that of <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">de Ravignan</a>, and while he was less didactic than <a href="../cathen/10508c.htm">Monsabr&eacute;</a> he was more original. A list of his works is given by Sommervozgel.
