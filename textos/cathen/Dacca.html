<p>DIOCESE OF DACCA (DACCHENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in Bengal, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. By the Constitution "&AElig;quam reputamus" <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> established in 1534 the See of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, conferring upon it <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> over all the Portugese possessions from the Cape of Good Hope to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. Early in the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> found their way into Eastern Bengal, and the Eurasian and native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities that grew up around the several settlements were, in virtue of the aforesaid Constitution, subject to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, and later (1606) to the See of Mylapore, suffragan to <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. When the political power of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> was replaced by British rule in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mylapore still retained <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Bengal, and seven thousand out of the twenty-two thousand <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> within the territory of the Diocese of Dacca are still subject to him. In the interest of more effective missionary work, <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, 18 April, 1834, appointed Robert of St. Ledger, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a> and the territory under its political jurisdiction, which at the time included the entire province of Bengal. In 1850, at the instance of Archbishop Carew, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Bengal, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> divided the province into two <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a>, one of Eastern, and other of Western Bengal. A subsequent subdivision (1870) resulted in the establishment of a third allotment, the Vicariate of Central Bengal. The territory of the third <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> was taken in part from the Eastern and in part from the Western vicariates.

<p>On the creation of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, Sept., 1886, the Eastern vicariate became the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Dacca, the district of Arakan (Burma) being substituted for that of Assam, which in 1889 became a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a>. With Dacca City as centre, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is bounded on the north by the Prefecture Apostolic of Assam, on the east by the Vicariates of Northern and Southern Burma, on the south by the Bay of Bengal, and on the west by the Bay of Bengal and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Kirishnagar. According to the latest Government survey the area thus enclosed measured fifty-nine thousand square miles, the population in the census of 1902 registered slightly above seventeen millions. The first occupant of the new see was Augustine Louage, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07403a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Cross</a>, who on his death in 1894 was succeeded by Bishop Hurth. Except for an interim of twelve years (1876-1888) when the mission was in care of members of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, religious of the congregation of the Holy Cross have laboured in Eastern Bengal since 1853. Since 1888 the Institute of the Holy Cross has had from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> exclusive charge of the mission. The nine "centres" into which the Diocese of Dacca is divided give opportunity to the twenty missionaries at work in it to carry on an active propaganda in outlying districts. In each centre there is a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and in many of the dependent stations there is catechumenate under the immediate supervision of local catechists and the elders of the respective communities. In Dacca, Chittagong, and the Akyab the mission conducts <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in which students, irrespective of <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, are prepared for "entrance" or collegiate work. The academy for girls in each of these cities is directed by a staff of 35 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, Daughters of Our Lady of the Missions (23), and the Sisters Catechists (12). The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> attendance for 1907 numbered 1768 pupils.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the Diocese of Dacca experiences all the obstacles common to foreign missionary work the world over. Dacca City is three-fifths <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a>, and among the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> of Eastern Bengal the traditional caste will oppose, for some time at least, an effective barrier to the rapid spread of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. As Dacca, however, is the college town of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, the percentage of students being relatively greater here than in any other city of the empire, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> has continually brightening prospects opening before it, in an around the capital of Bengal-Assam. The influential Somaj of Dacca is one of the many present day manifestations of the increasingly accurate appreciation of the part of function of reason in live. The widespread awakening of a critical <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> spirit, which has already questioned the feasibility of many caste observances, will eventually work harm to the claims of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a> itself. All this augurs well for the cause of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.
