<h1>Dagon</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> deity. It is commonly admitted that the name <em>Dagon</em> is a diminutive form, hence a term of endearment, derived from the Semitic root <em>dag</em>, and means, accordingly, "little fish". The name, therefore, indicates a fish-shaped god. This the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> also suggests when speaking of the Dagon <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worshipped</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a> (<a href="../bible/1sa005.htm#vrs1">1 Samuel 5:1-7</a>): he had face and hands and a portion of his body resembled that of a fish, in accordance with the most probable interpretation of "the stump of Dagon" (<a href="../bible/1sa005.htm#vrs5">verse 5</a>). From the received text of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> it would seem that he possessed even feet, although Swete's edition gives here a different reading; at any rate, this sentence, in the Greek translation, shows all the appearances of a <a href="../cathen/06586a.htm">gloss</a>. With the description found in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> coincides that which may be seen on the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of various <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> or <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nician</a> cities, on most of which Dagon is represented as a composite figure, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> as to the upper part of the body, fish-like as to the lower. From this it may well be inferred that Dagon was a fish-god, a fact not in the least surprising, as he seems to have been the foremost deity of such maritime cities as <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> (the early sites of which are supposed to be buried under the sand-mounds that run along the sea-shore), <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, and Arvad. In the monuments &#151; also most probably in the popular <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship</a> &#151; Dagon is sometimes associated with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> half-fish deity, Derceto or Atargatis, often identified with Astarte.

<p>A few scholars, however, waving aside these evidences, consider Dagon as the god of agriculture. This opinion they rest on the following statement of Philo Byblius: "Dagon, that is, corn' [the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> word for corn is <em>dagan</em>]. "Dagon, after he had discovered corn and the plough, was called Zeus of the plough" (ii, 16). The same writer tells us (in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Pr&oelig;p. Evang., i, 6) that, according to an old <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nician</a> legend, Dagon was one of the four sons born of the <a href="../cathen/09693a.htm">marriage</a> of Anu, the lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, with his sister, the earth. Moreover, on a seal bearing certain symbolic signs, among which is an ear of corn, but not, however, the image of a fish, may be read the name of Baal-Dagon, written in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nician</a> characters. It is open to question whether these arguments outweigh those in favour of the other opinion; so much so that the etymology adopted by Philo Byblius might possibly be due to a misapprehension of the name. It should, perhaps, be admitted that, along the Mediterranean shore, a twofold conception and representation of Dagon were developed in the course of time as a result of the presumed twofold derivation of the name. At, any rate, all scholars agree that the name and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship</a> of Dagon were imported from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14477d.htm">Tell-el-Amarna letters</a> (about 1480-1450 B.C.), which have yielded the names of Yamir-Dagan and Dagan-takala, rulers of <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, witness to the antiquity of the Dagon-worship among the inhabitants of Palestine. We learn from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> that the deity had <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> at <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> (<a href="../bible/jdg016.htm#vrs21">Judges 16:21, 23</a>) and <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a> (<a href="../bible/1sa005.htm#vrs1">1 Samuel 5:1-7</a>); we may presume that shrines existed likewise in other <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> cities. The Dagon-worship seems even to have extended beyond the confines of their confederacy. The testimony of the monuments is positive for the <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nician</a> city of Arvad; moreover, the <a href="../bible/jos000.htm">Book of Josue</a> mentions two towns called <a href="../cathen/02532c.htm">Bethdagon</a>, one in the territory of <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">Juda</a> (<a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs41">Joshua 15:41</a>), and the other on the border of <a href="../cathen/01774d.htm">Aser</a> (<a href="../bible/jos019.htm#vrs27">Joshua 19:27</a>); <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> also speaks of a Dagon "beyond <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>" (Antiq. Jud., XIII, viii, 1; De bell. Jud., I, ii, 3): all these names are earlier than the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelite</a> conquest, and, unless we derive them from <em>dagan</em>, witness to a wide dissemination of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship</a> of Dagon throughout Palestine. This <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship</a> was kept up, at least in certain <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> cities, until the last centuries B.C. &mdash; such was the case at <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Dagon that stood there was burned by <a href="../cathen/09493b.htm#jonathan">Jonathan Machabeus</a> (<a href="../bible/1ma010.htm#vrs84">1 Maccabees 10:84</a>; <a href="../bible/1ma011.htm#vrs4">11:4</a>).

<p>Unlike the <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baals</a>, who, among the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>, were essentially local deities, Dagon seems to have been considered by the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> as a national god (<a href="../bible/1ch010.htm#vrs10">1 Chronicles 10:10</a>). To him they attributed their success in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; him they thanked by great <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, before him they rejoiced over the capture of <a href="../cathen/13423a.htm">Samson</a> (<a href="../bible/jdg016.htm#vrs23">Judges 16:23</a>); into his <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> they brought the trophies of their victories, the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">Ark</a> (<a href="../bible/1sa005.htm#vrs1">1 Samuel 5:1, 2</a>), the armour, and the head of Saul (<a href="../bible/1sa031.htm#vrs9">1 Samuel 31:9-10</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch010.htm#vrs10">1 Chronicles 10:10</a>). A bronze demi-rilievo of <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyro</a>-<a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nician</a> workmanship would also suggest that Dagon played a prominent part in the doctrines concerning death and future life. As to the ritual of his <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship</a>, little can be gathered either from the documents or from <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>. The elaborate arrangements for returning the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">Ark</a> (<a href="../bible/1sa005.htm#vrs6">1 Samuel 5:6</a>) may have been inspired more by the circumstances than by any <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> of the Dagon-worship. We only know from ancient writers that, for <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> reasons, most of the <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> peoples <a href="../cathen/01067a.htm">abstained</a> from eating fish, a practice that one is naturally inclined to connect with the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">worship</a> of a fish-god.
