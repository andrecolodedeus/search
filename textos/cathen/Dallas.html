<p>DIOCESE OF DALLAS (DALLASCENSIS).

<p>The Diocese of Dallas, created 1890, comprises 108 counties in the northern and north-western portion of the <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">State of Texas</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> and El Paso County in the western section, an area of 118,000 square miles. The city of Dallas has a population of 95,000 and stands in the centre of a circle within whose radius of fifty miles is included nearly one-half of the population of <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. It was settled chiefly by people from <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, with a sprinkling of foreigners and a considerable number of <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>. It is an important distributing centre, rich in mineral resources and products of the soil (chiefly cotton). As late as 1868 there was only one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> resident there whose members, with several scattering settlers, were attended as a mission station from St. Paul's, Collin County, by Father Joseph Martinere, later a domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. His visits often necessitated journeys over hundreds of miles through swamp and forest. In 1892 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> had grown to 15,000 with 30 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> ministering to them.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, THOMAS FRANCIS BRENNAN, was born October 10, 1853, in the County Tipperary, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> [in Bally Cullen --<em>ed.</em>] and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a> in the Tyrol, 4 July, 1880. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Erie</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, 5 April, 1891. Two years later (1 February, 1893) he was transferred to the titular See of Utilla and made coadjutor of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. John's, Newfoundland. He was removed December, 1904, and called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he resides (1908), having been transferred, 7 October, 1905, to the titular See of Caesarea in Mauretania.

<p>As his successor the Rev. EDWARD JOSEPH DUNNE, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the church of All Saints, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, was chosen. He was born in the County Tipperary, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 23 April, 1848, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> when a child, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 29 June, 1871, in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, 30 November, 1893. He foresaw from the first the religious possibilities assured by the location and resources of Dallas, also by the enterprise of the people and by the climate. To his energy, administrative abilities, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> is owing the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, admittedly the finest in the South-Western States. The <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentian</a> College, St. Paul's Sanitarium, the Ursuline Academy, <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and provincial house (1907), the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, St. Patrick's church, the industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for coloured children are other monuments of religion erected within a short space of time. Fort Worth, Sherman, El Paso, Denison, Munster, Weatherford, Marshall, and several other cities have substantial and even beautiful churches and religious institutions, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and charitable.

<p>Religious communities represented in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <em>Men.</em> &mdash; <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a>, five charges; <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, six; Oblates; and <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentians</a>. <em>Women.</em> &mdash; School Sisters of Notre Dame; Sisters of Charity (Emmitsburg); <a href="../cathen/07705a.htm">Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word</a>; <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>; Sisters of Loretto; Sisters of St. Mary; Sisters of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>; White <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters of the Congregation of Mt. Olive; Sisters of <a href="../cathen/13192c.htm">St. Rose of Lima</a>; <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Nuns; <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/14269a.htm">Statistics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (1908) give 83 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (50 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and 33 regulars); 52 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, 51 with missions, 75 stations, 12 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 12 academies for girls, 24 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 3180 pupils, 14 <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students, 1 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (50 pupils); 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> (83 inmates); 6 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; total <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population (estimated) 60,000.
