<h1>Damascus</h1>  

<p>Damascus, in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, is one of the oldest cities in the world. According to <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Flavius Josephus</a> it was founded by Us, grandson of Shem. It is mentioned in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> at the time of Abraham (<a href="../bible/gen014.htm#vrs15">Genesis 14:15</a>; <a href="../bible/gen015.htm#vrs2">15:2</a>); also on the pylons of Karnak, among the Syrian cities captured by the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> Touthmes III.
<h2>Kingdom of damascus</h2>

<p>Damascus allied itself with Soba against <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, was conquered and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to receive a Jewish garrison (<a href="../bible/2sa008.htm#vrs5">2 Samuel 8:5</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch018.htm#vrs5">1 Chronicles 18:5</a>), but under Solomon it became the capital of an independent kingdom, established by Razon or Rasin (<a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#vrs24">1 Kings 11:24</a>). From this time Damascus was frequently at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the kings of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, while it leaned on those of Juda, who sought with its aid to weaken their rivals of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. The most famous of these enemies of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was Hazael, who had ascended the throne of Damascus with the help of Elijah and Elisha (<a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#vrs17">1 Kings 19:17</a>; <a href="../bible/2ki008.htm#vrs28">2 Kings 8:28</a>; <a href="../bible/2ki010.htm#vrs32">10:32</a>; <a href="../bible/2ki013.htm#vrs3">13:3</a>). His successors were less fortunate. Jeroboam II, King of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, captured Damascus (<a href="../bible/2ki014.htm#vrs28">2 Kings 14:28</a>). When not engaged in mutual conflict the kings of Damascus and Samaria entered into alliances with the neighbouring princes against the powerful kings of <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, hence Damascus, usually at the head of the confederation is often mentioned in cuneiform inscriptions. In 734 B.C. Damascus and Samaria nearly ruined <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. But Achaz, King of Juda, invoked the help of the Assyrian King Tiglath-Pileser III (Theglathphalasar), who defeated the allies, captured Damascus after a siege of two years, and put an end to the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki016.htm#vrs9">2 Kings 16:9-12</a>).
<h2>The Greek city</h2>

<p>Thenceforth Damascus seems to have lost its autonomy. Jeremias (<a href="../bible/jer049.htm#vrs27">49:27</a>) threatens it with new chastisements, a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that it had risen from its decay; however, it appears only occasionally in the history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Greeks and Romans. After the battle of <a href="../cathen/08201b.htm">Issus</a> (333 B.C.) the city, which held the wives and treasures of Darius, was betrayed to Parmenion. It soon became, next to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, the most important city of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. From 112 to 85 B.C. it was the capital of a little Graeco-Roman kingdom, but fell successively into the power of Aretas III, King of <a href="../cathen/11777b.htm">Petra</a>, of Tigranes, King of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, and finally of the Roman general Metellus. In 64 B.C. Pompey received there the ambassadors and gifts of the neighbouring kings; in the following year <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> became a Roman province. <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod the Great</a> built a theatre and a gymnasium at Damascus, though the town was outside his dominion. Its population, though Syrian by race and language, was deeply affected by Greeco-Roman culture, and made rapid progress in trade and industry. Then, as now, Damascus was the chief commercial emporium for the nomad <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. In the time of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> there were in Damascus about 50,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Most of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the upper classes of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> had embraced this creed. It was on the road to and near the city that Saul, the severe persecutor of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, recognized and worshipped the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> whom he had <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> so much. Saul was brought to Damascus, lodged at Juda's in the Via Recta (today Souk el-Taouil), was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Ananias (who is thought to have been the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Damascus), preached Christ, and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee by night to Arabia (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs3">Acts 9:3 sqq.</a>, <a href="../bible/act022.htm#vrs6">22:6 sqq.</a>, <a href="../bible/act026.htm#vrs12">26:12 sqq.</a>, <a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs17">Galatians 1:17</a>; <a href="../bible/2co011.htm#vrs32">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>). The city then belonged to Aretas, King of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> slaughtered by treachery 10,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the gymnasium of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>. After the destruction of the Nabatean Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/11777b.htm">Petra</a> by <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, Damascus became a Roman city. Under Arcadius the great temple of the local god, Rimmon, was transformed into the magnificent church of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>. In 610 the city was used by Chosroes as his headquarters during the long <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> he then began against Heraclius.
<h2>The See of Damascus</h2>

<p>Damascus was then the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Pheenicia Secunda, or Libanensis, with eleven suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, it was subject to the Patriarchate of Antioch and held the sixth rank in the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Lequien</a> (Oriens christ., II, 833) was acquainted (from the first to the sixteenth century) with the names of only fourteen Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, among them St. Peter, who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> in the eighth century. Numerous Jacobite <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are also known. Among the many illustrious men born at Damascus, we must mention: <ul><li>Nicholas, a Greek writer under <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, <li>Damascius, a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> of the sixth century, <li>John Moschus, the author of the charming "Pratum spirituale", <li>St. Sophronius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (634-638), <li>St. Andrew, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Crete, orator and hymnographer, <li>finally, the celebrated Greek <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>.</ul>

<p>Early in 635 Damascus was captured by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> under Khalid and Abou Obeidah. Free public worship was allowed to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in several churches, also in the western aisle of St. John's, the eastern aisle being reserved to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>. It was only at the beginning of the eighth century that Abd el-Melek obtained from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the use of the whole building, in return for which he allowed them four churches. From 660 to 753, under the Ommayad caliphs, Damascus was the capital of the Arabian empire, at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> Abu Abbas removed the seat of government to Baghdad. In the following centuries, amid broils and revolutions, Damascus fell into the hands of the Toulounides of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, later into those of the Ikshidites and of the Fatimites. In 1075-1076 it was taken by the Seljuk Turk Aziz. In 1126 the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, commanded by Baldwin of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, defeated Prince Toehtekin near and south of the city but were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to retreat. Nor were the allied princes, Conrad III of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Louis VII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and Baldwin III of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, more successful in their siege of Damascus (1148), owing to the treason of the barons of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Nour-ed-Din, Sultan of <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, captured Damascus in 1158. In 1177 Saladin repulsed a new attack of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> army. Damascus then became the commercial, industrial, and scientific centre of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>; it had a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine and an observatory on the Djebel Kasioun. Under Saladin's successors it had to sustain several sieges; in 1260 it opened its gates to the Mongols of Houlagou. It then fell into the hands of Kotouz, Prince of the Mamelukes of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, whose successor, Bibars, rebuilt its citadel. In 1300 it was plundered and partly burnt by the Tatars commanded by Ghazzen Khan. In 1399 Timur-Leng <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> almost all the inhabitants, except the sword-cutlers. These he brought to Samarkand and Khorassan where they continued to make the beautiful damascened blades, the secret of which has long been lost at Damascus. In 1516 Selim I conquered <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> from the Mamelukes, and Damascus belonged to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a> into the twentieth century. Mention should be made of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> occupation by Ibrahim Pasha (1832-1840), and the frightful slaughter of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (July, 1860) which caused the flight of many thousands and brought about the occupation of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> by a French army.
<h2>The Turkish city</h2>

<p>Damascus (Arab. <em>Dimisk es-Sham</em>, or simply <em>es-Sham</em>), the eye or the pearl of the East for the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, is now the capital of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. The city stands 2267 feet above sea level and enjoys a very mild climate, owing to the Barada, which runs through it and to its numerous fountains or springs. It is surrounded by the groves and gardens of the Ghouta which stretch about ten miles south and east and include twenty-nine villages, the inhabitants of which are devoted to fruit culture (oranges, lemons, etc. especially plums and apricots). Within the city are the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Noured-Din, Saladin, and Bibars, 850 fountains, 64 <em>hammams</em> (baths), 25 bazaars, a stock exchange for the local trade, a half-ruined citadel, 248 mosques, etc. The mosque of the Ommayads (anciently St. John's church) was burned in 1893, on which occasion many <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and works of art were lost.
<h2>Religious conditions</h2>

<p>Damascus is a Latin <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>, and three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the sixteenth century are mentioned in the "Revue benedictine" 1907, (82-85). It is also a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (also for the non-Catholic) <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> Greeks, and for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Syrians, and finally an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>. Since the sixteenth century the non-Catholic Greek Patriarchs of Antioch have lived at Damascus. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, as well as the Syrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> patriarch, also resides at Damascus and governs his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> through a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, who replaced the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at the time of their suppression, have operated a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> there; in 1872, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> began to occupy the reputed house of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> have the Latin <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys. Other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders active in Damascus have included the Sisters of Charity and the Mariamet native sisters.
