<p>DIOCESE OF DAM&Atilde;O (DAMAU, DAMAUN)

<p>Suffragan to <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, and situated in Portugese <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, was erected by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Human&aelig; Salutis" of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 1 September, 1886, which confirmed the concordat then entered into between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and Dom Luis I, King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. This concordat effected a settlement of the opposing claims to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, on the one part, and the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a>, on the other (see PADROADO). A pontifical <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 14 March, 1887, confirmed the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> by the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> of Dom Antonio Pedro da Costa to be first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dam&#227;o with the titular Archbishopric of Cranganor, and that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> 19 June, 1887. The church of Bom Jesus, at Dam&#227;o, then became the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the new diocese.

<p>The city of Dam&#227;o, on the Arabian Sea, at the mouth of the Dam&#227;o River, about 100 miles north of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> State of Guzerat. It first came to the notice of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> in 1523, when Diogo de Mello, overtaken by a storm on his way to Ormuz, took refuge in the harbour. In 1529 an expedition sent by Dom Nuno da Cunha, the Portugese viceroy, sacked and burned the city, and in 1541 da Cunha himself, on his way to the conquest of Diu disembarked his whole army at Dam&#227;o and caused Mass to be celebrated there for the first time. But it was not until the feast of the Purification in the year 1558 that another viceroy, Dom Constantino de Braganza, undertook to acquire finally the place for his sovereign; the native garrison, although much more numerous than the attacking force of 3000, fled at their approach, and the capture was effected without bloodshed. The victorious commander at once caused a mosque to be prepared for <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>; Father Gonsalo da Silveira, Provincial of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> there, and the mosque became the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church of S&#227;o Paulo. From that time until its erection as a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, in 1886, Dam&#227;o belonged to the <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Archdiocese of Goa</a>.

<p>The territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> extends along the shores of the Arabian Sea from the Narbada River, on the north, to Ratnagiri, on the south, and is bounded on the east by the Western Ghats. Thee are 71,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 51 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 21 affiliated <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and about 85 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The stipends of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are for the most part paid by the Portugese Government. The territory is divided into districts as follows: Dam&#227;o, 4 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 5 affiliated <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, Diu, 2 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; Thana (Vicariate), 25 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; Konkan, 2 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>; Bassein, 12 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>; Bombay, 6 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 5 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. To each of the churches of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is attached, where instruction is given in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, music, English, and Portugese, as well as, in some instances, Guzerati and Mahratti. Some of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> receive subsidies from both the Portugese and the British-Indian governments. The spiritual work of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is very largely helped by means of confraternities, of which there are at least 42 in the Vicariate of Thana alone.

<p>Among the churches in the city of Dam&#227;o the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Bom Jesus is worthy of note as having been built, in 1559, on the site of an old mosque. At Dam&#227;o Pequeno (Little Dam&#227;o) the church of Nossa Senhora do Mar, founded in 1701, in the old fortress, is still used by local <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Another fortress church is that of the Concei&ccedil;&#227;o at Diu, which was originally built in 1610 as part of the now extinct <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of S&#227;o Paulo. The vicariate of Thana includes the island of Salsette, of which Thana itself was formerly the capital. Here, before the Mogul invasion of 1318, a community of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> existed. The conquering <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> converted both the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> churches and the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> into mosques for their own worship. It was also at Thana that the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries Thomas of Tolentino and Giacomo of Padua, with the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> Demetrius and Peter, were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> early in the fourteenth century. Fra Jordanus, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, who buried the bodies of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, was himself also <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> of the vicinity so highly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> his memory as to set up a bronze <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of him among the gods in one of their <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>; this temple was afterwards destroyed, and in the sixteenth century some workmen who were digging on the spot found among the ruins this <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> tribute to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. Thana was also the field of the fruitful labours of Father Gon&ccedil;alo Rodrigues, one of the companions of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, who founded in the neighbourhood a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> village. This village was destroyed by the Mahrattas, but the ruins of its church, college, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> are still distinguishable. The church of Nossa Senhora do Carmo at Chaul, in the Konkan district, dates from the year 1580. Bassein, first acquired by <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in 1534, is memorable for the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of five religious burned alive in the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> invaders in 1540, as well as for the apostolic visits of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>. Lastly, in the Mazagon suburb of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a> is the church of Nossa Senhora da Gloria, long regarded locally as the Portugese <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; here also is the Bombay residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dam&#227;o, Titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cranganor.
