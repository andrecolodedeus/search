<h1>Daniel Ammen</h1>  

<p>American naval officer and author, b. in Brown County, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, 15 May, 1820; d. in Washington, D.C., 11 July, 1898. His father, a soldier of the War of 1812, migrated to <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> from <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>. He was appointed midshipman, 7 July, 1834, and ordered to West Point, where he studied for three months, under his brother Jacob Ammen, later a brigadier general in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Army. After serving at sea for several years, he was sent to the Naval School, then near Philadelphia. He was appointed lieutenant 4 November, 1849, and became rear admiral 11 December, 1877. During the Civil War, he was engaged in blockade <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> with Admiral Dupont's fleet. He was chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks from 1 May, 1869, to 1 October, 1871, and chief of the Bureau of Navigation from 1 October, 1871, until his retirement, 4 June, 1878. He devoted much time to work on harbour defences, and designed the ram Katahdin, also the "Ammen balsa," or life-raft, used in the navy. In 1872 he was appointed member of a commission to examine and report on the feasibility of constructing a canal through Nicaragua. The commission reported in favour of the Nicaraguan route, which he strongly advocated. In 1879, he was sent as a delegate to a congress in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to discuss Isthmian canal questions. He also served on the board for the location of the new Naval Observatory. After his retirement he purchased a farm twelve miles from Washington, at a station named in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Ammendale, the seat of the Normal School of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, where through his generosity St. Joseph's church was built. Among his works are "The Atlantic Coast" (New York, 1883); "Recollections of Grant" (1885); "The Old Navy and the New" (autobiographical) (Philad., 1891); "Country Homes and Their Improvements"; "Fallacies of the Interoceanic Transit Questions," and various contributions to current literature.
