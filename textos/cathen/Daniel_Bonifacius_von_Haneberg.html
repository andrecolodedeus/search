<h1>Daniel Bonifacius von Haneberg</h1>  

<p>A distinguished German <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a> of the nineteenth century, b. At Tanne near Kempten, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 16 June, 1816; d. At Speyer, the capital of the Rhine Palatinate (Bavaria), 31 May, 1876. He began his classical course at Kempten, where he pursued with superior ability and industry the studies prescribed by the curriculum, and mastered with hardly any guidance several Oriental languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a>). He next betook himself to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, where he completed his elementary studies in the gymnasium, and followed the courses of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. While a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> student, he cultivated Sanskrit and Chinese over and above the Oriental languages with which he was already acquainted, translated a few works of <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>, contributed several essays and poems to various German periodicals, and neglected nothing of what appertains to the spiritual life in one preparing for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He took his degree of Doctor of Theology at the University of Munich in 1839, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, on 29 August of the same year. The following November he qualified for a Privatdozent in the University of Munich by his thesis "De significationibus in Veteri Testamento pr&aelig;ter literam valentibus" (Munich, 1839), and began in December his career of thirty-three years as a lecturer of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. In 1841, he became extraordinary professor of Hebrew and of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and in 1844 ordinary professor. His lectures, wherein he displayed a solid learning, a constant discretion, and a deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, were attended with great profit and delight by an increasing number of students not only from <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, but also from the other German States, and soon <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be regarded as one of the most prominent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> professors of his day.

<p>Haneberg was also a distinguished and prolific writer. During the years 1840 and 1841 he worked on his "Die religi&ouml;sen Alterth&uuml;mer der Hebr&uuml;er", and in 1844 he published his "Einleitung in das Alte Testament" as a text-book for his lectures. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, he recast both these works, the former of which passed to the second edition in 1869 under the title of "Die religi&ouml;sen Alterth&uuml;mer der Bibel", and the latter of which appeared rewritten as "Geschichte der biblischen Offenbarung," and was rendered into French by Goschler (Paris, 1856), reaching a fourth edition in 1876. Besides these, his best-known works, he published several others which were chiefly the fruit of his Hebrew and Arabic studies, and formed his contribution to the Journal of the Oriental Society and to the transactions of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences of which he became a member in 1848. Among these latter works the following may be mentioned: "Ueberdie arabische Psalmen&uuml;bersetzung des Saadia;" "Uber das Schulwesen der Mohammedaner;" "Er&ouml;rerungen &uuml;ber Bendo-Wakidi's Geschichte der Eroberung von Syrien;" "Ueber die Theologie des Aristotles;" and chiefly his "Canones S. Hippolyti arabice e codd. Romanis cum versione latin&acirc;, annotationibus, et prolegomenis." He found time also for contributing articles to the Kirchenlixicon of <a href="../cathen/15607b.htm">Wetzer</a> and <a href="../cathen/15587a.htm">Welte</a>. Nor did he neglect in any way the various <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> calling, such as preaching, attendance at the confessional, answers to sick-calls, etc. His learning and still more his virtues, secured for him great favor at the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> court, and he acted as tutor in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the Duke Maxmilian and Prince Leopold. In 1850, he joined the Order of St. Benedict, and a few years afterwards (1854) was chosen <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Boniface at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. He soon founded the Reform School at <a href="../cathen/16003a.htm">Andechs</a> in Upper <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and a little he tried, but with small success, to establish missions of his order in <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a> and in the Orient.

<p>At the approach of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> he was invited by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> to share in the labours preparatory to that August assembly. After the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> had been solemnly proclaimed by the Council (18 July, 1870), and publicly accepted by the German Bishops assembled at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, (end of August, 1870), Hanneberg humbly gave up his former views concerning this point of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and sincerely submitted to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. From 1864 onwards, several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> had been offered him, but he had declined them all. At length, however, on his presentation by the King of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> for the Bishopric of Spires and at the instance of the Sovereign Pontiff, the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> accepted that see, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 25 August, 1872. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and success in the government of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> fully justified his selection for the episcopal dignity. In days of violent opposition to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> &mdash; the days of the framing and application of the Falk Laws (1872-1875) &mdash; he unflinchingly fought against the encroachments of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> on the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. He also strenuously, though not always successfully, combated the influence of the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a> of the time. He was most unsparing of himself in his confirmation tours, although the bodily fatigues thus entailed were far too much for his failing strength. After a few days of sickness he succumbed (31 May, 1876) to pneumonia, which he had contracted in one of those episcopal tours, and was lamented by both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people who revered him as a saint.
