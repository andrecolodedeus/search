<h1>Daniel Fitter</h1>  

<p>Born in Worcestershire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 1628; died at St. Thomas' Priory, near Stafford, 6 Feb., 1700. He entered <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> College at the age of nineteen, went through his studies with some distinction, and was raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1651. A year or two later, he returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and was appointed <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to William Fowler, Esq., of St. Thomas' Priory, near Stafford, where he remained until his death. During the reign of James II, he opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Stafford, which was suppressed at the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">revolution in 1688</a>. At the period of excitement ensuing upon the Titus Oates plot (1678), he, with a few others, upheld the lawfulness of taking the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> then tendered to every well-known <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. He himself subscribed it, and defended his action on the ground of a common and legal use of the term "spiritual". In consequence of this, when the chapter chose him as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the Counties of Stafford, Derby, Cheshire and Salop, they required that he should "sign a Declaration made by our Brethren in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> against the Oath of Supremacy".

<p>In a letter to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> (1684), <a href="../cathen/07502c.htm">Cardinal Philip Howard</a> recommended warmly the "Institutum clericorum in communi viventium", founded in 1641 by the German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/07439b.htm">Bartolomaus Holzhauser</a>, and approved by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> in 1680 and 1684. The institute met with eager acceptance in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and Fitter was appointed its first provincial president and <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> for the Midland district. The association was, however, dissolved shortly after his death by Bishop Giffard in 1702, on account of a misunderstanding between its members and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. Fitter had bequeathed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to "The Common Purse" of the institute, with a life-interest in favour of his elder brother Francis; but when the institute ceased to exist, Francis, by a deed of assignment, established a new trust (1703), called "The Common Fund" for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the district. This fund became subsequently known as "The Johnson Fund" and still exists. Daniel Fitter also left a fund for the maintenance of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it should be to reside in the county of Stafford and take spiritual charge of the poor <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the locality.
