<h1>Daniel Murray</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, b. 1768, at Sheepwalk, near Arklow, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Dr. Betagh's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in and at Salamanca and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1790. After some years as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> in Dublin he was transferred to Arklow, and was there in 1798 when the rebellion broke out. The soldiers shot the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in bed and Murray, to escape a similar <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, fled to the city where for several years after he ministered as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a>. In 1809 at the request of <a href="../cathen/15066b.htm">Archbishop Troy</a> he was appointed coadjutor-bishop, and in 1823, on Dr. Troy's death, he became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. While coadjutor he had filled for one year the position of president of <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>. Dr. Murray was a uncompromising opponent of the "veto" and a strong supporter of the Catholic Association. On other questions he was less advanced, and was in such favour at Dublin Castle that he was once offered a seat on the Privy Council, which he declined. He supported Stanley's National Education scheme and among the first Education Commissioners, he wished to tolerate the Queen's Colleges, in opposite to the views of <a href="../cathen/09499a.htm">Archbishop MacHale</a>. He had hesitation, however, in accepting the adverse decision of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was present at the Synod of Thurles where the Queen's Colleges were formally condemned. He was a charitable, kindly man, respected even his opponents.
