<h1>Daniel O'Daly</h1>  

<p>A diplomatist and historian, born in Kerry, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1595; died at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 30 June, 1662. On his mother's side he belonged to the Desmond branch of the Geraldines, of which branch his paternal ancestors were the hereditary chroniclers or bards. He be came a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> in Tralee, Co. Kerry; took his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a>, studied at <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, gained his doctorate of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, and returned as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to Tralee. In 1627 he was sent to teach <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the newly established College for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. In 1629 he went to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> on business connected with this college and, seeing that Philip IV of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> favoured the project, he, assisted by three of his <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> brethren, established, in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> College of which he became the first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. He conceived the project of erecting, near <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, to serve as a refuge in time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Philip granted permission to do so on condition that he should raise a body of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> soldiers for Spanish service in the Low Countries. O'Daly set sail for Limerick and got the men. On his return to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> (1639), Belem on the Tagus, four miles below the city, was selected as a site and, with the assistance of the Countess of Atalaya, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Our Lady of Bom Successo was built. The king had such confidence in him that he made him envoy to Charles I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to the exiled Charles II, and to <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Pope Innocent X</a> (1650). The Queen of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> also sent him as envoy to <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Pope Alexander VIII</a>.

<p>In the year 1655 he was sent as envoy from John IV of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> to Anne of Austria and <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> to conclude a treaty between <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Here as elsewhere, success attended him; but while negotiations abroad and matters of government at home afforded opportunities of serving the House of Braganza, he would not accept any <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in return. His acquaintances praise his straightforwardness, honesty, tact, and disinterestedness. He refused the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> and the Primacy of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> and the Bishopric of Coimbra; nor would he accept the titles of Privy Councillor or Queen's Confessor, though he held both offices. In 1665 he published "Initium, Incrementum, et Exitus Famili&aelig; Geraldinorum, Desmoni&aelig; Comitum, Palatinorum Kyerri&aelig; in Hibernia, ac Persecutionis H&aelig;reticorum Descriptio" etc., his work on the Earls of Desmond, for which he availed himself of the traditional <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his ancestors. In the first part he describes the origin of the Munster Geraldines, their varying fortunes, and their end in the heroic struggle for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and fatherland. It is our chief authority on this subject. The second part treats of the cruelties inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of twenty <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, many of whom had been with him in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. The work was translated into French by Abb&eacute; Joubert (1697), and into English by the <a href="../cathen/10145c.htm">Rev. C.P. Meehan</a>, Dublin (2nd edition annotated, 1878.) During these years his chief concern was to put his college on a firm basis and to make it render the greatest possible service to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Bom Successo became too small for the number of students. In 1659 he laid the first stone of a larger building which was called Corpo Santo. To provide funds for these houses he consented to become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a> and, in consequence, President of the Privy Council; but before the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> arrived he died. His remains reposed in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of Corpo Santo until the earthquake of 1755; the inscription on his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> recorded that he was "In varus Regum legationibus felix, . . . Vir Prudentia, Litteris, and Religione conspicuus." (Successful in embassies for kings . . . A man distinguished for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.) A few years after the catastrophe, on the same spot, with the same name and object, a new college and church arose, which, with Bom Successo, keep O'Daly's memory fresh in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> to the present day.
