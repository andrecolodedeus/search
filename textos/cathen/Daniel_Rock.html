<h1>Daniel Rock</h1>  

<p>Antiquarian and ecclesiologist, b. at <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, 31 August, 1799; d. at Kensington, London, 28 November, 1871. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11239a.htm">St. Edmund's College</a>, Old Hall, where he studied from April, 1813, to Dec., 1818. There he came under the influence of the Rev. Louis Havard from whom he acquired his first interest in liturgy, and was the intimate companion of the future historian, <a href="../cathen/14723b.htm">Mark A. Tierney</a>. He was then chosen as one of the first students sent to reopen the English College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he remained till he took the degree of D.D. in 1825. He had been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 13 March, 1824. On his return to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> he becomes assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at St. Mary's, Moorfields, till 1827, when he was appointed domestic <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to John, Earl of <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, with whom he had contracted a friendship based on similarity of tastes while at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He accordingly resided at <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">Alton</a> Towers, Staffordshire, till 1840, with the exception of two years during which Lord Shrewsbury's generosity enabled him to stay at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> collecting materials for his great work, "Hierurgia or the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", which was published in 1833. He had previously published two short works: "Transubstantiation vindicated from the strictures of the Rev. Maurice Jones" (1830), and "The Liturgy of the Mass and Common Vespers for Sundays" (1832).

<p>In 1840 he became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Sir Robert Throckmorton of Buckland in Berkshire, and while there wrote his greatest book, "The Church of Our Fathers", in which he studies the <a href="../cathen/13479a.htm">Sarum Rite</a> and other <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> observances. This work, which has profoundly influenced <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> study in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and which caused his recognition as the leading authority on the subject, was published in 1849 (vols. I and II) and 1853-4 (vol. III). After 1840 Dr. Rock was a prominent member of the "Adelphi", an association of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were working together for the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. When this object was achieved, he was elected one of the first canons of <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Southwark</a> (1852). Shortly after, he ceased <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work, and having resided successfully at Newick, Surrey (1854-64), he went to live near the South Kensington Museum in which he took the keenest interest and to which he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of much service. His "Introduction to the Catalogue of Textile Fabrics" in that Museum has been separately reprinted (1876) and is of great authority. He also contributed frequent articles to the Arch&#230;ological Journal, the Dublin Review, and other periodicals. For many years before his death he held the honourable position of President of the Old Brotherhood of the English Secular Clergy. There is an oil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of him at <a href="../cathen/11239a.htm">St. Edmund's College</a>, Old Hall.
