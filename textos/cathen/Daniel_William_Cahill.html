<h1>Daniel William Cahill</h1>  

<p>Lecturer and controversialist, born at Ashfield, Queens County, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> 28 November, 1796; died at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.</a>, 28 October, 1864. The third son of Daniel Cahill, a civil engineer, he was sent to Carlow College, and in 1816 entered Maynooth, where he became proficient in natural philosophy and languages. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> after he had passed through the Dunboyne establishment, and in 1825 was appointed professor of natural philosophy at Carlow College where he taught for some years. He then opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Seapoint, Williamstown, which he conducted from 1835 to 1841. Meanwhile he wrote largely for the press, and for a time edited the Dublin "Telegraph". He became a distinguished preacher and lecturer, and his vigorous attacks on the government and the Established Church of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> extended his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> in all directions. In December, 1859, he visited the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and lectured on Astronomy and other scientific subjects, and preached in many American and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> cities. As he generally gave his services for religious and charitable purposes, large sums of money were raised by him for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> objects. He was of commanding presence, being six feet five inches in height, and extremely handsome. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, but his body was exhumed in 1885 and taken to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where it was buried in Glasnevin Cemetary, Dublin. His writings consist chiefly of lectures and addresses, with some letters to prominent <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The most important of them were collected and published in Dublin in 1886 under the title "Life, Letters, and Lectures of Rev. Dr. Cahill".
