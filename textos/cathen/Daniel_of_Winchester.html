<h1>Daniel of Winchester</h1>  

<p>(Danihel), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the West Saxons, and ruler of the See of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> from 705 to 744; died in 745. The prominent position which he held among the English <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of his time can best be appreciated from the fact that he was the intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/01280b.htm">St. Aldhelm</a> at <a href="../cathen/13756c.htm">Sherborne</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> at Jarrow and of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Daniel was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to succeed Bishop Hedda of Wessex whose vast <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was then broken up; Dorsetshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, and Berkshire became the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Sherborne under <a href="../cathen/01280b.htm">St. Aldhelm</a>, while Daniel retained only Hampshire, Surrey, and Sussex, and of these Sussex soon after was constituted a separate diocese. Daniel like Aldhelm had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> under the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholar Maildubh at <a href="../cathen/09572c.htm">Malmesbury</a> and it was to Malmesbury that he retired in his old age when loss of sight compelled him to resign the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. There, no doubt, he had also learnt the scholarship for which he was famous among his contemporaries and which made <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> turn to him as the man best able to supply information regarding the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> of the south and west of Britain. Daniel, however, is best remembered for his intimate connection with <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. It was from Daniel that the latter received commendatory letters when he started for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and to Daniel he continually turned for counsel during his missionary labours in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Two letters of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> to <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> are preserved (see Haddan and Stubbs, "Councils", III, 304 and 343) and give an admirable impression of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and good sense. In the second of these epistles, which was written after his loss of sight, Daniel takes a touching farewell of his correspondent: "Farewell, farewell, thou hundredfold dearest one." Daniel had made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 721 and in 731 assisted at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Archbishop Tatwine. He seems never to have been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint. A vision recorded in "Monumenta Moguntina", No. 112, perhaps implies that he was considered to be lacking in energy; none the less it would follow from <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury's</a> reference (Gest. Pont., I, 357) to a certain stream in which Daniel used to stand the whole night long to cool his passions, that he was a man of remarkable austerity.
