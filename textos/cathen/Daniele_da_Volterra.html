<h1>Daniele da Volterra</h1>  

<p>(RICCIARELLI).

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/15504b.htm">Volterra</a>, 1509; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1566. Ricciarelli was called Volterra from the place of his birth. As a boy, he entered the studios of <a href="../cathen/14129a.htm">Bazzi (Il Sodoma)</a> and of <a href="../cathen/11738a.htm">Baldassare Peruzzi</a> at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, but he was not well received and left for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he found his earliest employment. He formed a friendship with <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, who assisted whim with commissions, and with <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and suggestions, especially for his series of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in one of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the Trinita dei Monti. By an excess of praise, his greatest picture, the "Descent from the Cross", was at one time grouped with the "Transfiguration" of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> and the "Last Communion" of <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>, as the most famous pictures in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His principal work was the "Murder of the Innocents", which he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for the Church of St. Peter at <a href="../cathen/15504b.htm">Volterra</a> now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. Volterra was commissioned by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> to complete the decoration of the Sala Regia. On the death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (1549) he lost his position as superintendent of the works of the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11645a.htm">pension</a> to which it entitled him. He then devoted himself chiefly to <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>. Commissioned by <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> to supply draperies to some of the nude figures in the magnificent "Last Judgment" by <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, he thus obtained the opprobrious nickname "Breeches Maker" or "Il Bragghetone". His "Victory of David over Goliath" now in the Louvre, is so good that for years it was attributed to <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>. His work is distinguished by beauty of colouring, clearness, excellent composition, vigorous <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and curiously strange oppositions of light and shade. Where he approaches closely to <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, he is an <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">artist</a> of great importance; where he partakes of the sweetness of <a href="../cathen/14129a.htm">Sodoma</a>, he becomes full of mannerisms, and possesses a certain exaggerated prettiness. A recent author has wisely said: "He exaggerates <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo's</a> peculiarities, treads on the dangerous heights of sublimity, and, not possessing his master's calm manner, is apt to slip down." His position in present-day criticism is very different to what was given to him a generation ago, and more nearly approaches to a truthful view of his art.
