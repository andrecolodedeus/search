<h1>Daniello Concina</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> preacher, controversialist and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. at Clauzetto or San Daniele, small places in the Italian province of Friuli, 20 October, 1687; d. at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 21 February, 1756. On the completion of his early studies at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> making his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> in March 1708, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Sts. Martin and Rose. After studying <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> three years, he was sent to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Holy Rosary at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where he spent eight years under the direction of the fathers of his order, Andruisso and Zanchio. In 1717 he was appointed to the chair of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and later to that of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/06137a.htm">Forli</a>. About this time he began to attract attention as a preacher. He confined himself at first to the smaller places, but his success soon brought him to the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a> of the chief cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; and he preached the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons seven times in the principal churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Concina's literary activity was confined chiefly to moral topics. His career as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and controversialist began with the publication of his first book, "Commentarius historico apologeticus", etc. (Venice, 1736, 1745), in which be refuted the opinion, then recently adopted by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, that <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> had borrowed his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and form of religious poverty from St. Francis. While engaged in the sharp controversy aroused by this work, he entered into another concerning the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten fast</a>, which was not closed until <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> issued (30 May, 1741) the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>, "Non ambigimus" which was favourable to Concina's contention. Shortly afterwards he published his "Storia del probabilismo e rigorismo" (Venice, 1743), a work composed of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, moral, and critical dissertations. Being directed against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, it naturally gave rise to a large controversial literature. The work was highly praised by some notably by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, but among others it met with a very unfavourable reception. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Fathers of the Society of Jesus</a>, the recognized champions of probable opinions in matters of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, were not slow in defending their position. The controversy reached a climax when Concina published under the auspices of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, his "Theologia christiana dogmatico-moralis" (12 vols. in 4<sup>to</sup>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1749-51). The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to have it condemned on the ground that it contained <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and was very injurious to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. A commission of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> was then appointed to examine the work, with the result that Concina was requested to prefix to the subsequent edition a declaration dictated by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This declaration, which was practically a summary of the petition of condemnation made by his opponents, appeared in the edition of 1752, but that work itself showed no changes of importance, except the addition of one chapter to the preface in which the author protested that he had always entertained the sincerest regard for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, that as private <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> he refuted opinions which he considered lax, regardless of authorship, and that if he had <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in any way or done any wrong, he was ready to make a full retractation (cf. Theol. Christ., ch. xiii in praef. t. 1, p. cxxiv).

<p>In his "Theologia christiana" Concina found occasion to pay to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> as a whole a glowing tribute. Many of its writers are spoken of by him in terms of high esteem. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he promoted the publication of a <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Gabriel Antoine, which <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> ordered to be taught in the College of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, he was an ardent probabiliorist, and from his point of view many of the opinions of the <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">probabilists</a> were lax and pernicious. In refuting them he at times undoubtedly censured their authors too severely and spoke with an excessive asperity. It must be admitted, however, that he placed a salutary, if disagreeable, restraint upon the new thought of the time. Today it is readily seen that some of the authors whom he attacked favoured a dangerous laxism. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that many of his views are now considered severe, some classing him among the rigorists. That Concina was a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> of no mean order is evidenced by the fact that <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> appointed him consultor of several Congregations. Moreover, in his work "De Synodo Dioecesana", as also in his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Libentissime" of 10 June 1745, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refers to Concina as an authority on the question of the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten fast</a>. Concina is the author of about forty works, several of which are believed to be still in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> awaiting an editor.
