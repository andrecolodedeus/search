<h1>Daughters of Providence</h1>  

<p>Founded at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, by Madame Polaillon (Marie de Lumague), a devout <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. In 1643 Madame Polaillon, having obtained letters patent from Louis XIII, opened a home to provide protection and instruction for young girls, whom beauty, poverty, or <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> neglect exposed to the loss of Faith and other spiritual perils, placing it under the protection of Providence, with the name Seminary of Providence. Among the many who sought admission were some capabgof instructing the rest, and of these, seven, who gave evidence of a <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">religious vocation</a>, were selected to form a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community under rules drawn up for their use by <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> at the direction of Fran&ccedil;ois de Gondy, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1647). New letters patent were granted by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, whose mother, Anne of Austria, gave the institute its first fixed abode, the Hospital de la Sant&eacute; in Faubourg Saint-Marcel (1651), previously a home for convalescents from the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, a grant confirmed by royal letters in 1667, bestowing on the religious all the privileges, <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and exemptions accorded to <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of royal foundation. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> established other houses in various parts of the city, and foundations were made first at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and Sedan, where special attention was devoted to Jewish converts and the reclamation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. After two years of probation candidates were admitted to the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of chastity, obedience, the service of others, and perpetual stability. The superior, elected every three years, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior, appointed by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, were assisted in the temporal administration of the community by two <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> matrons, chosen from among the principal benefactresses. In 1681 some members of the congregation joined the Sisters of Charitable Instruction of the Child Jesus of Saint-Maur, established by Nicolas Barr&eacute; in 1678, thenceforth known as the Ladies of Saint-Maur and of Providence; the remaining members became canonesses of the Congregation of Our Lady, founded by <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a>. The foregoing congregation became a model for others established to carry on a similar work in various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, whose activities, however, came eventually to embrace the administration of elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and asylums for the blind and deaf mutes, and the care of the sick in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and their own homes. In 1903 the number of Sisters of Providence in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> exceeded 10,000. From the original <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Providence also came the religious who formed the nucleus of the Congregation of Christian Union subsequently established by M. le Vachet, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whose counsels had encouraged Madame Polaillon.
