<h1>Davenport</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF DAVENPORT (DAVENPORTENSIS)

<p>The Diocese of Davenport, erected 8 May, 1881, embraces the four southern tiers of counties of the <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">State of Iowa</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> an area of about 22,873 square miles. From the time of the Louisiana Purchase down to 1827 the present Diocese of Davenport was included in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>; from 1827 to 1837 it formed part of the Diocese of St. Louis; and from 1837 to 1881 it belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Diocese of Dubuque</a>. When Bishop Loras arrived in Dubuque in April, 1839, his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contained two churches. St. Raphael's in <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, built in 1836, and St. Anthony's in Davenport, built in 1838. In all the vast territory subject to him there was but one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the Rev. Samuel Mazzuchelli, O.P., who had been labouring in the territory since 1835 and under whose direction the two churches referred to had been built. Bishop Loras brought with him two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Rev. Joseph Cretin, afterwards first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and the Rev. J. A. M. Pelamourgues, whom the people of St. Anthony's parish, Davenport, and indeed of the whole Diocese of Davenport, venerate as their first resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. Father Pelamourgues, the first citizen of Davenport in his day, a leader in every good work, was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Anthony's from 1839 to 1868. Of the generous, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> associated with him in his work in those early days, Mr. and Mrs. Antoine* Le Claire deserve special mention. Notable among their benefactions was the donation to the church of the block of ground in the heart of the city on which St. Anthony's church was built.
<h2>Growth of Catholicism</h2>

<p>Bishop Loras and his successors in the See of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a> did much to promote the immigration to <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a> of German and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, with the result that <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a> has a large <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rural population. Between the years 1840 and 1850 the number of resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> in the present Diocese of Davenport increased from one to five. By the year 1860 the number had increased to thirteen, and by 1870 to twenty. During the decade following 1870 the tide of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigration was heavy, and at the time of its formation, in 1881, the diocese contained seventy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population estimated at 45,000. Since its formation the diocese has had a continuous, healthy growth.
<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>(1) JOHN McMULLEN, was born in Ballynahinich, Co. Down, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 8 January, 1832, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 20 June, 1858. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 25 July, 1881, at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, where at the time of his appointment to Davenport, he was <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. He entered with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and vigour into the work of organizing the new diocese. The cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was his especial concern. St. Ambrose College was founded by him in September, 1882. His health soon failed, and he died 4 July, 1883.

<p>(2) HENRY COSGROVE, second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was born at Williamsport, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> 19 December, 1834. He <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to Dubuque in 1845 and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 7 August, 1857. He was assigned at once to St. Marguerite's, Davenport, with which church he was ever afterwards connected. When Bishop McMullen went to Davenport, he chose St. Marguerite's for his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> and made <a href="../cathen/04403b.htm">Father Cosgrove</a> his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. <a href="../cathen/04403b.htm">Father Cosgrove</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Davenport, 14 September, 1884, and for more than twenty-two years gave his best efforts to the cause of religion in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Under his guidance many new churches were erected; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and other institutions established or enlarged. Worthy of special mention are the Sacred Heart <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, St. Vincent's home for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and St. Ambrose College.

<p>(3) Two years before his death, <a href="../cathen/04403b.htm">Bishop Cosgrove</a>, enfeebled in health, was given a coadjutor in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the Very Rev. James Davis. Bishop Davis was born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1852, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1878, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> coadjutor to <a href="../cathen/04403b.htm">Bishop Cosgrove</a>, 30 Nov., 1904, and on the death of the latter became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Davenport.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities represented in the diocese include the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, who have charge of four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> who have one; the Sisters of St. Benedict, Sisters of Charity B.V.M., Sisters of Charity of St. V. de Paul, Hospital Sisters of St. Francis, School Sisters of St. Francis, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, <a href="../cathen/07418a.htm">Sisters of the Holy Humility of Mary</a>, Sisters of Mary, School Sisters of Notre Dame, Sisters of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>.
