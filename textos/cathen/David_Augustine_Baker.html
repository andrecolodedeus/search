<h1>David Augustine Baker</h1>  

<p>A well-known <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> mystic and an <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetic</a> writer, born at Abergavenny, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 9 December, 1575; died of the plague in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 9 August, 1641. His father was William Baker, steward to Lord Abergavenny, his mother, a daughter of Lewis ap John (<em>alias</em> Wallis), Vicar of Abergavenny. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Christ's Hospital and at Broadgate's Hall, now Pembroke College Oxford, afterwards becoming a member of Clifford's Inn, and later of the Middle Temple. At Oxford he lost his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, but after some years, being in extreme peril of death, he escaped by what appeared to him a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. Following up the light thus given him, he was led to the threshold of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and was received into its fold. In 1605 he joined the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, but ill-health <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to postpone his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, and he returned home to find his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> on the point of death. Having reconciled him to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and assisted him in his last moments, Father Baker hastened to settle his own worldly affairs and to return to the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a> by the Italian Fathers in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as a member of the Cassinese Congregation, but subsequently aggregated to the English Congregation. At the desire of his superiors he now devoted his time and the ample means which he had inherited, to investigating and refuting the recently started <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that the ancient <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> congregation in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was dependent on that of Cluny, founded in 910. He was immensely helped in his studies and researches for this purpose by the Cottonian Library which contained so many of the spoils of the old <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and which its generous founder placed entirely at his disposal. In collaboration with Father Jones and Father Clement Reyner he embodied the fruit of these researches in the volume entitled "Apostolatus Benedictorum in Anglia". At Sir Robert Cotton's Father Baker came in contact with the antiquary, William Camden, and with other learned men of his day. In 1624 he was sent to the newly established <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, not as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, but to aid in forming the spiritual character of the religious. Here he remained for about nine years, during which time he wrote many of his <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> treatises, an abstract of which is contained in the valuable work "Sancta Sophia" compiled by <a href="../cathen/04486b.htm">Father Serenus Cressy</a>. In 1633 he removed to <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, where he wrote his long treatise on the English mission, but he was nearly worn out with his austerities before the order came for him to proceed to the battle-field. During his short sojourn in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, Father Baker was forced frequently to change his abode in order to avoid the pursuivants who were on his track. It was not, however, as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> that he was to end his days, but as a victim of the plague to which he succumbed in the sixty-sixth year of his age. Of upwards of thirty treatises chiefly on spiritual matters written by Father Baker, many are to be found in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> at <a href="../cathen/05149a.htm">Downside</a>, Ampleforth, Stanbrook, and other <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. An adequate biography of this master of the ascetic life is still a desideratum.
