<h1>David Paul Drach</h1>  

<p>Convert from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 6 March, 1791; d. end of January, 1868, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Rosenthal's "Convertitenbilder" (III, 48) prefaces the autobiography of Drach with the following words: "The conversion of this learned Jewish <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a> is undoubtedly one of the most important conversions effected by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> during this century in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and became the source of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to many of his coreligionists." This conversion, affecting one who enjoyed the highest esteem as an author and a learned rabbi, produced a most profound impression on all active and earnest minds of the rising generation, and incited them to the study of the more serious problems of life. His endeavours to lead his coreligionists to the living fountain of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to the acknowledgment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as the real and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, crystallized in numerous writings and were blessed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Herein lies the net result of this scholar's conversion.

<p>Drach received his first instruction at the hands of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, a renowned Hebraist and Talmudic scholar, whose linguistic talents the son inherited. At the age of twelve Drach entered the first division of the Talmudic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Edendorf near Strasburg. This course of study, lasting ordinarily for three years, he completed in one year, and entered the second division of the Talmudic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Bischheim in the following year. He graduated in eighteen months and then matriculated in Westhofen to qualify as a teacher of the Talmud. When only sixteen years of age he accepted the position of instructor at Rappoltsweiler, remaining there three years; afterwards he followed the same profession in Colmar. Here the ambitious youth devoted himself <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> to the study of secular <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> to which he had already seriously applied himself while prosecuting his Talmudic studies. Having obtained the rather unwilling permission of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he received a call to a prominent position in the Central Jewish Consistory and at the same time fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of tutor in the household of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>. The marked results of his method of teaching induced even <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm#christian">Christian families</a> to entrust their children to his care. It was under these circumstances that he received the first impulse towards a change of his religious views which ultimately resulted in his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. He writes: "Stirred by the edifying examples of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> continually set before me to the furtherance of my own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the tendency towards <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, born in earlier life, acquired such strength that I resisted no longer." He now applied himself studiously to patristic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and specialized in the study of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> with a view towards ascertaining the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the unanimous reproach of the Fathers, viz. that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had falsified the Hebrew text. These studies resulted in his unquestioned <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Divinity and Messiahship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. On <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, 1823, he renounced <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> in the presence of Archbishop Qu&eacute;len, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the following (Holy) Saturday, and on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter morning</a> received his first <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> and the Sacrament of Confirmation. Two daughters and an infant son were also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. His wife, the only member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> who adhered stanchly to the old <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/01032b.htm">abducted</a> the children. They were returned, however, after two years.

<p>After a few years Drach went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was appointed librarian of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (1827), which office he held at his death. Among the many converts who trace their conversion to the influence of Drach's example are the Libermann brothers; <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">Franz Maria Paul Libermann</a> was especially indebted to Drach for his sound advice and active assistance in the establishment of the "Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary". Of Drach's numerous writings the following deserves particular mention: "Lettres d'un rabbin converti aux Isra&eacute;lites, ses fr&#232;res" (Paris, 1825). He also published the "Bible de Vence", with annotations (Paris, 1827- 1833) in 27 volumes octavo. He remodelled the Hebrew-Latin Dictionary of Gesenius, and published a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Hebrew-Chaldaic dictionary of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (ed. <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, Paris, 1848). He wrote, moreover, "Du divorce dans la synagogue" (Rome, 1840); "Harmonie entre l'&eacute;glise et la synagogue" (Paris, 1844); and "La Cabale des H&eacute;breux" (Rome, 1864).
<h2>Paul Augustin Drach</h2>

<p>Son of the preceding; born 12 August, 1817; died 29 October, 1895; canon of Notre-Dame and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a> of importance. He studied at the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> there in 1846. We owe to him a large French Bible commentary (La Sainte Bible, Paris, 1869) in which he himself wrote on the Pauline Epistles (1871), the <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a> (1879), and the Apocalypse (1879).
