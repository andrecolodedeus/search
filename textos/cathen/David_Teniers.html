<h1>David Teniers</h1>  

<p>The name of two eminent <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> landscape <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>; the elder, born at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in 1582; died there in 1649; the younger; born at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in 1610; died at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1694. Of these two men, the younger was by far the greater, eclipsing in skill the work of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. Teniers the elder was the son of a mercer, Julian Teniers, and was brought up and trained by his elder brother. He entered for a while the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, later on visited <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and studied under Elsheimer in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He returned to his own country in 1606 and spent the rest of his life at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> landscape pictures, illustrations from rural sports, and some classical and historical scenes. His son, David Teniers the younger, was one of four brothers, David, Julian, Theodore, and Abraham, and he in his turn had a son and a grandson named David. Nothing whatever is known of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who taught the younger Teniers; in all probability he was brought up in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> studio, although it has been stated by some writers that he worked under <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, or under <a href="../cathen/02803b.htm">Brouwer</a>. He certainly was on terms of intimate acquaintance with <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, but we hear nothing of this acquaintance until 1637, when he married Anne, the daughter of Brueghel, the pupil of <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, and the great <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> came to the wedding. The girl was not yet seventeen; she bore Teniers five children and died in 1656. Six months later, Teniers married Isabel, the daughter of an eminent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who was secretary to the Council of Brabant.

<p>Teniers is said to have received a fortune with each wife, and to have made a great deal of money from the sale of his pictures. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he had ample means, was able to purchase a ch&acirc;teau, to live in good circumstances, and eventually to obtain admission to the ranks of the nobility after he had ceased to exercise his profession for gain. The statement of his appeal to be received as a member of an old <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and the description of his <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> are still in existence. He was patronized by the Governor of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, the Archduke William, and by his successor Don Juan of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Philip IV and Christina of Sweden were also amongst the eminent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who gave him commissions for pictures. He was a man of the greatest industry, and his delightful little works, perhaps numbering nearly eight hundred in all, are to be found all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. As a rule, they are scenes from peasant life, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in beautiful colour schemes and dexterously handled. They can be studied especially in the galleries of <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, the National Gallery in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, the Louvre, the Prado, the Imperial Gallery at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and the Hermitage at St. Petersburg. Of these galleries the Louvre has the greatest number, possessing nearly forty examples of the work of this skilful <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. Alone amongst the members of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he appears to have been a practical <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>.
