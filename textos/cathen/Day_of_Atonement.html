<h1>Day of Atonement</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Yom Hakkippurim</em>. <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, <em>Dies Expiationum</em>, and <em>Dies Propitiationis</em> &mdash; Leviticus 23:27-28)

<p>The rites to be observed on the Day of Atonement are fully set forth in the sixteenth chapter of Leviticus (cf. <a href="../bible/exo030.htm#vrs10">Exodus 30:10</a>; <a href="../bible/lev023.htm#vrs27">Leviticus 23:27-31</a>, <a href="../bible/lev025.htm#vrs9">25:9</a>; <a href="../bible/num029.htm#vrs7">Numbers 29:7-11</a>). It was a most solemn <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a>, on which no food could be taken throughout the whole the day, and servile works were forbidden. It was kept on nineteenth day of <em>Tischri</em>, which falls in September/October. The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> included a calf, a ram, and seven lambs (<a href="../bible/num029.htm#vrs8">Numbers 29:8-11</a>). But the distinctive <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the day was the offering of the two goats.

<blockquote><p>He (<a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>) shall make the two buck-goats to stand before Lord, in the door of the tabernacle of the testimony: and casting lots upon them both, one to be offered to the Lord and the other to be the emissary-goat: That whose lot fell to be offered to the Lord, he shall offer for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: But that whose lot was to be the emissary goat he shall present alive before the Lord, that he may pour out <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> upon him, and let him go into the wilderness . . . After he hath cleansed the sanctuary, and the tabernacle, and the altar, let him offer the living goat: And putting both hands upon his head, let him confess all the iniquities of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>, and all their offences and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that they may light on his head, he shall turn him out by a man ready for it, into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. And when the goat hath carried all their iniquities into an uninhabited land, and shall be let go into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, Aaron shall return into the tabernacle of the testimony. (<a href="../bible/lev016.htm#vrs7">Leviticus 16:7-10, 20-23</a>). </p></blockquote>

<p>The general meaning of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is sufficiently shown in the text. But the details present some difficulty. The <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> <em>caper emissarius</em>, "emissary goat", represents the obscure <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Azazel</em>, which occurs nowhere else in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. Various attempts have been made to interpret its meaning. Some have taken it for the name of a place where the man who took the goat away used to throw it over a precipice, since its return was thought to forbode <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Others, with better reason, take it for the name of an <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a>; and in fact a spirit of this name is mentioned in the Apocryphal <a href="../cathen/01602a.htm"><em>Book of Henoch</em></a>, and later in Jewish literature. On this interpretation&mdash;which, though by no means new, finds favour with modern critics&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> would seem to be that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were sent back to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> to whose influence they owed their origin. It has been noted that somewhat similar rites of expiation have prevailed among <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> nations. And modern critics, who refer the above passages to the Priestly Code, and to a post-Exilic date, are disposed to regard the sending of the goat to Azazel as an adaptation of a pre-existing ceremonial.

<p>The significant <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> observed on this solemn Day of Atonement does but give a greater prominence to that need of satisfaction and expiation which was present in all the ordinary sin-offerings. All these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as we learn from the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/07181a.htm">Epistle to the Hebrews</a>, were figures of the great Sacrifice to come. In like manner these Jewish rites of atonement speak to us of the Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of the propitiatory Sacrifice which is daily renewed in a bloodless manner on the Eucharistic Altar. For this reason it may be of interest to note, with Provost Maltzew, that the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> used on the Day of Atonement foreshadow the common commemoration of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed in our <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> (<em>Die Liturgien der orthodox-katholischen Kirche des Morgenlandes</em>, 252).
