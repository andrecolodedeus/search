<h1>Dean</h1>  

<p>(Gk. <em>d&eacute;ka</em>, ten; <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>decanus</em>).

<p>One of the principal administrative officials of a diocese. The term was first used to denote a military officer having authority over ten soldiers; in the fourth century it came to be used as a title for certain minor officials in the imperial household. A completely civil aspect was given to the office in Anglo-Saxon times in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the dean having <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> within his district or tithing for trials of first instance.

<p>In the monastic life we find the term used by St. Benedict (Rule, c. xxi) to denote a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who was placed over ten other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> being to see that their work was properly done and that they observed the rules of the house in which they were living. The custom which the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> thus introduced soon found its counterpart in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> pastoral work. The early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities were always desirous of uniting themselves to the urban <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but for people who lived far away from the city communication with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was not always easy; hence they were provided for by the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> whose position was sometimes permanent, sometimes temporary. These <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were merely assistants to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and in the early fourth century became known as <em><a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a>.</em> Special decrees were made concerning them at the Councils of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> (314) and Antioch (341). The <em><a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a>,</em> though frequently having the charge of several <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, were nevertheless always subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city from whom they received their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. They could only confer <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. Most of them were simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but they had extensive faculties. (See Gillmann, "Die Chorbisch&ouml;fe im Orient", <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1903.) For the East the office of <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a> was abolished at the Council of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> (between 343 and 381) because episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> had been usurped by many who held the office; in their place (can. lvii) were substituted <em>circuitores, visitatores.</em> But it was only in and after the eighth century that it finally disappeared in the East, though yet customary among the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>. In the West, during and after the tenth century, there appeared another representative officer, the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, who took the chief burden in administering the temporal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and enjoyed, after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the greatest consideration. He was present at councils as the representative of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and on the death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he became the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, to which he usually succeeded.

<p>The immediate administrative necessities of the numerous rural <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were provided for by the appointment of several archpriests, who represented either the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, and were originally the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having charge of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> churches. In the West, after the restoration of the <em>vita canonica</em> in the latter half of the eighth century, their number and influence grew. They were charged with the supervision of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life and conduct, with the execution of episcopal commands, and were wont to convoke more or less frequently the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of their district (<em>capitula ruralia, concilia, calend&oelig;</em>). They made a yearly report to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It is to these ancient offices that the modern dean has succeeded (see S&#228;gm&uuml;ller, Entwickelung des Archipresbyterats, 1898). There are at present two classes of deans: deans of chapters (<a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or collegiate) and deans of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> districts. The latter act as representatives of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in certain matters, as heads of aggregations of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, either urban or rural. The dean is also known by the name of vicar forane (<em>vicarius foraneus</em>).
<h2>Rural deans</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> it is to be noted that the dean has only delegated <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, restricted to a particular area and to certain matters specified by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. His powers are generally determined by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, by custom, or by special mandate of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In countries where canon law is in full force deans have power to dispense and absolve in certain cases. They can also institute an inquiry or informative process to be afterwards transmitted to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Furthermore, they are to see that the churches in their district are well-ordered both in spiritual and in temporal affairs, and they can grant leave of absence to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for short periods. They also have charge of the solemn installation of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, care for them in grave illness, and provide for their decent burial. They possess also, in some places, certain honorary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, e.g. precedence, and occasionally some distinction in dress. In countries where canon law is not in full vigour the powers and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of rural deans vary greatly; in fact, each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> may be said to have its own peculiar customs and regulations. In some <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the deans merely preside at the monthly conference; in others the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives them faculties to dispense in certain cases, and they have care of the temporalities of the churches in their districts when there is a change of <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the deans can grant certain <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, and absolve from reserved <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; they also have to guard against the growth of abuses among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. They transmit to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the orders of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and render to him an annual account as to the state of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in their care. Quite similar are the provisions of the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (cap. iv, nos. 27-30) for the office of dean in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
<h2>Deans of chapters</h2>

<p>The first dignitary of a chapter is variously styled. Sometimes he is called <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>; in other places he is called the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> or dean. The office is in the appointment of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The dean takes precedence of all the other members of the chapter in choir and processions and deliberations. His <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> or prerogatives are to celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is prevented from so doing. He also administers the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to the ordinary and celebrates the funeral Mass. During <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> he gives the signal to commence etc., and he also corrects mistakes and remedies abuses at variance with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> decrees and local approved custom. He is bound to be present in choir and to give a good example to the chapter, both in his behaviour and in the manner in which he recites or sings the various portions of the Divine liturgy.

<p>In modern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> the dean is an officer chosen by the professors of his faculty to represent them as a body, to preside over their meetings, and to supervise the regularity of the ordinary academic exercises. His authority is based partly on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents of foundation, partly on the enactments of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> authorities, and partly on custom.

<p>The following are the decanal offices now existing in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>: honorary deans, e.g. the dean of the Chapels Royal; dean of peculiars, i.e. having <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> but no <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>; provincial dean, an office always held by the (<a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>; deans of chapters, who rule over the canons of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or collegiate churches, and are bound to be in residence for eight months in the year; rural deans who act as deputies for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> (Cambridge, Oxford), the dean has the care of the discipline of the college and the arranging of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> services.
