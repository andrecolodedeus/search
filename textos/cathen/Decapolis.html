<h1>Decapolis</h1>  

<p>(From Greek <em>Deka</em>, ten, and <em>polis</em>, city)

<p>Decapolis is the name given in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and by ancient writers to a region in Palestine lying to the east and south of the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Sea of Galilee</a>. It took its name from the confederation of the ten cities that dominated its extent. The Decapolis is referred to in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> three times: <a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs25">Matthew 4:25</a>; <a href="../bible/mar005.htm#vrs20">Mark 5:20</a>; <a href="../bible/mar007.htm#vrs31">7:31</a>. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, Ptolemy, Strabo, Pliny, and other ancient geographers and historians make frequent reference to it.

<p>At the disruption of the army of Alexander the Great, after his burial at <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a>, great numbers of his veterans, their occupation gone, settled down to a life of peace. The coast towns being already peopled, many of the Greeks sought homes farther inland. There they either laid out new cities or rebuilt and transformed older ones. In 218 <font size=-2>B. C., </font> according to Polybius, several of these towns were looked upon as strong fortresses. As long as the <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucid&aelig;</a> ruled in the North and the Ptolemies in the South, the influence of the Greeks remained paramount in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>; but when, with the rise of the Romans, the power of the descendants of Alexander's soldiers weakened, the Greek cities were in sore straits. Especially perilous was the plight of these towns in Palestine after the successful rise of the Machabees. In the years 64-63 <font size=-2>B. C., </font> however, Pompey overran <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and made it a Roman province. The Grecian cities, being regarded as bulwarks of Roman rule against any native uprisings, were granted many favours. They enjoyed the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>, preserved their municipal freedom, and were allowed a certain sway over the near-by country.

<p>It was after Pompey's conquest that the league of the Decapolis was formed. There is no record of the year, and although most likely it was soon after the coming of Pompey, yet it may not have been until <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> time. The earliest list of the ten cities of the Decapolis is Pliny's, which mentions Scythopolis, <a href="../cathen/11608c.htm">Pella</a>, <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, Dion, <a href="../cathen/06469a.htm">Gerasa</a>, Philadelphia, Raphana, <a href="../cathen/03244a.htm">Canatha</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>. Later, Ptolemy enumerates eighteen cities, thus showing that the term Decapolis was applied to a region. The importance of this league was greatly strengthened by the advantageous positions of the principal towns. Scythopolis, the capital of the Decapolis, lay at the head of the plain of Esdraelon, to the west of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, guarding the natural portal from the sea to the great interior plateau of Basan and Galaad. The other cities were situated to the east of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> on the great routes along which passed the commerce of the whole country. Today the cities of the Decapolis, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, are deserted and in ruins. Yet even in their ruined state they offer a striking contrast to the near-by cities of the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semites</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, theatres and forums built on a lavish scale, give even to this day clear indication of the genius of the people who built them.

<p>Among the cities of the Decapolis of special interest are: Damascus, so often referred to in the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; Gadara, on the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Sea of Galilee</a>, whose inhabitants were the Gerasens of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> &mdash; the <em>Gadarenon</em> of one reading of <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs28">Matthew 8:28</a> &mdash; whose swine were driven by the devil into the sea; and Pella, the city in the valley of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> withdrew at the first siege of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.
