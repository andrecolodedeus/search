<h1>Decree</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>decretum</em>, from <em>decerno</em>, I judge).

<p>In a general sense, an order or <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> made by a superior authority for the direction of others. In <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> use it has various meanings. Any <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10602a.htm">Motu Proprio</a> is a decree inasmuch as these documents are legislative acts of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Holy Father</a>. In this sense the term is quite ancient. <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> speaks (Ep. i, ad Himer., c. ii) of the <em>decreta generalia</em> of <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> are empowered to issue decrees in matters which come under their particular <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Each <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, and also each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> may issue decrees in their periodical <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> within their sphere of authority. The word is also used to denote certain specified collections of church law, e.g. The Decree of Gratian (Decretum Gratiani). In respect of the general legislative acts of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> there is never <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the universal extent of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>; the same may be said of the decrees of a General Council, e.g. those of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> was the first to apply the term indiscriminately to rulings concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> (<em>decreta de fide, de reformatione</em>). The decrees of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> are certainly binding in each case submitted for judgment. But there are varying opinions as to whether such judgment is to be taken as a rule or general law applying to all similar cases. The common opinion is that when the decisions are enlargements of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (<em>declaratio extensiva legis</em>) the decisions do not bind except in the particular case for which the decree is made. If, however, the decision is not an enlargement, but merely an explanation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (<em>declaratio comprehensiva legis</em>), such decree binds in similar cases. The decrees of a national council may not be <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> until they have received the approval of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The decrees of a provincial synod have no force until they have been approved by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This approval is twofold: ordinary (<em>in form&acirc; communi</em>), and specific (<em>in form&acirc; specific&acirc;</em>). The former means that there is nothing which needs correction in the decrees of the synod, and they thereby have force in the province. This is the approval generally given to such decrees. If approval is given in <em>form&acirc; specific&acirc;</em> the decrees have the same force as if they emanated from the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, though they are binding only in the province for which they are made. The decrees of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> deal with the administration and good order of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. If they are made during a synod, they are <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are usually known as "diocesan statutes", or "synodal statutes", and bind until <a href="../cathen/13007a.htm">revoked</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his successor. If the decrees are extra-synodal, they have force only during the lifetime of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or until he revokes them himself. For the so-called "Decretum Gelasianum" see GELASIUS I. For the use of judicial <em>decreta</em> in canonical procedure see <a href="../cathen/11697a.htm">Permaneder</a> in Kirchenlexikon, III, 1442-44.
