<h1>Dedication</h1>  

<p>A term which, though sometimes used of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service, is more properly applied to the "setting aside" of places for a special and sacred purpose (cf. Hastings, Dict. of the Bible). The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, indeed, believes that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is everywhere and that the Divine Immensity fills all space; but this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not exclude the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of reserving a special spot in which the creature may hold communion with his Creator and worship Him. That the setting aside of this hallowed place was ever done with a certain show and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is evident from the examples of Jacob (<a href="../bible/gen028.htm#vrs18">Genesis 28:18</a>), of Moses (<a href="../bible/lev008.htm#vrs10">Leviticus 8:10</a>), and above all, of Solomon (<a href="../bible/1ki008.htm">1 Kings 8</a>). This precedent of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> was too obvious to be overlooked in the New, and we may be sure that the modern custom was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Apostolic usage. In a fragment of a <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (cf. D'Ach&eacute;ry, Spicilegium IV) this passage occurs: "Rom&aelig; dedicatio prim&aelig; Ecclesi&aelig; a beato Petro construct&aelig; et consecrat&aelig;". It is not strange, however, that owing to the persecutions of the first three centuries, references to the dedication of churches are extremely rare. The first authentic accounts of this kind are furnished by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250110.htm"><em>Church History</em> X.3-4</a>; De Vit&#226; Const., IV, xliii, in P.G., XX), and <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> (<a href="../fathers/26022.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.26</a>) in regard to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> (314) and Constantine's church at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The well-known historical document entitled "Peregrinatio Silvi&aelig;" (Etheria) has a full description of the celebration of the dedicatory festival of the church of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> as it was witnessed by our pilgrim-authoress in the fourth century (cf. Cabrol, Livre de la pri&#232;re antique, p. 311). Here it will suffice to emphasize, in connexion with the dedication of churches, (1) the ritual employed, (2) the minister, (3) necessity and effects, and (4) festival and its days.

<p>(1) In the beginning the dedication <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was very simple. A letter of <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bracara (538) states: "Consecrationem cujuslibet ecclesi&aelig;, in qu&#226; non ponuntur sanctuaria (reliqui&aelig;) celebritatem tantum scimus esse missarum" (We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of any church in which shrines (<a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>) are not placed consists merely in the celebrations of Masses). That the primitive ceremonial consisted mainly in the celebration of Mass, where there were no <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, is also shown from the old "Ordines Romani" (cf. Mabillon, "Museum Italicum", II in P.L. LXXVIII, 857). Where <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were used the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of translating and depositing them under the altar formed a notable feature of the dedication rite (cf. "Ordo of St. Amand" in Duchesne, "Christian Worship", London, 1903, Appendix; "Ordo of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>" in <a href="../cathen/02541a.htm">Bianchini</a>, ed., "Lib. Pont.", III). The first complete formulary is found in the Gelasian Sacramentary (in P.L., LXXIV), which embodies the Roman <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> usages of the seventh century. Here the rite consists of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, sprinklings with <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>. So quickly, however, was this ritual elaborated that in the ninth century it attained the completeness which it enjoys at the present time (cf. the eighth- century "Liber Sacramentorum" in P.L., LXXVIII; "Ordines Romani", ed. Mart&#232;ne, "De Ant. Eccl. Rit.", III; Daniel, "Cod. Lit.", I). The modern dedicatory ceremonial assumes two forms according as a church is simply blessed or solemnly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. In the former case the function consists of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, sprinklings of <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, and Mass (cf. <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>; Schulte, "Benedicenda", p. 155, etc.). The solemn rite of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is described in the article <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">C<font size=-2>ONSECRATION</font></a>.

<p>(2) The solemn <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of dedication, or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> is found in the Roman Pontifical and is performed <em>de jure</em> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (see C<font size=-2>ONSECRATION</font>). The simpler rite, which is given in the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, is generally reserved to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but may be also undertaken by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> with episcopal delegation.

<p>(3) All churches, public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> and semi-public, if destined for Divine worship <em>in perpetuum,</em> must be at least blessed before the Sacred Mysteries can be regularly celebrated in them (Cong. of Rites, Sept., 1871). Purely private or domestic <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> may not be thus dedicated, but simply blessed with the <em>Benedictio loci</em> (cf. <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> or <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>) on each occasion Mass is said in them. As a rule the principal churches in every district should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the solemn manner, but as certain conditions are required for licit <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> that are not always feasible (cf. <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Ecclesiastical Record, April, 1908, p. 430) the ordinary simple dedication rite is regarded as practically adequate. Both forms render the place sacred, and contribute, as <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>, to the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but they differ in this that while a church that is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> must, if polluted, be reconciled by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a church that is simply blessed may be reconciled in similar circumstances by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>).

<p>(4) Another difference in the effects of the two forms of dedication is that a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> church is entitled to celebrate each year the anniversary feast of its <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, which is to be held as a double of the first class with an octave, by all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attached to the church. A church that is only blessed has no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to this anniversary feast unless <em>per accidens,</em> that is, when it is included in the special <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> granted for the simultaneous celebration of the anniversaries of all the churches in a district or diocese. In this case the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> must be celebrated in every church, within the limits of the <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> independently of their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> (Cong. of Rites, n. 3863). Though any day may be selected for the dedication of a church, yet the Roman Pontifical suggests those "Sundays and solemn festive days" which admit the dedicatory <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a>, as well as the anniversary celebration.
