<h1>Defender of the Matrimonial Tie</h1>  

<p>(<em>Defensor matrimonii</em>)

<p>The Defender of the Matrimonial Tie is an official whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is to defend the marriage-bond in the procedure prescribed for the hearing of matrimonial causes which involve the validity or nullity of a marriage already contracted. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Dei Miseratione", 3 November, 1741, introduced this official into the marriage procedure to guard against abuses occurring from the ordinary procedure. An annulment of a marriage might result from the appearance of only one of the married couple who desired freedom to enter upon a new marriage, while the other was apathetic and conniving at the annulment, or at times unable or indisposed to incur expense to uphold the marriage-tie, especially if it implied an appeal to a higher court. Perhaps, too, the judicial decision might induce change of opinion without sufficient warrant. <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">Scandal</a> arose from the frequency of dissolution of marriages with the freedom to enter new contracts. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Dei Miseratione" requires that in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the ordinary shall appoint a defender of marriage, upright in character, and learned in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, an ecclesiastic if possible, a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may suspend him or remove him for cause, and, if he is prevented from taking part in the procedure, substitute one with the requisite qualifications. He must be summoned to any trial in which there is question, before a competent judge, of the validity or nullity of a marriage, and any proceeding will be null if he is not duly cited. He must have the opportunity to examine the witnesses, and, orally or in writing, to bring forward whatever arguments may favour the validity of the marriage. He must be cited even though the party interested in the defence of the marriage be present, and all the acts of the court are always to be accessible to him, and at any time he has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to bring forward new documents or witnesses favourable to the marriage. On assuming his office he must take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to fulfil its <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and he is expected to renew the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in each case. If the judge decides in favour of the marriage the defender takes no further action unless its opponent appeals to a higher court. Here a defender undertakes anew the defence of its validity. If the judge of first instance decides against the validity of the marriage and no one else appeals, the defender of marriage is required by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Dei Miseratione" in all cases to appeal to the higher court. If the first two courts agree upon the nullity of a marriage the defender need not appeal, unless his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> tells him that a serious mistake was made. If he feels it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to appeal a new marriage may not be contracted till his plea is heard. The decision in matrimonial cases is never absolutely final; so that if new, serious reason appears for the validity of a marriage, it must be judicially investigated.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> was extended and enforced in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> by an Instruction of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> in 1883, published with the "Acts and Decrees of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore". Though the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Dei Miseratione" does not require it, the practice of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> extends the intervention of the defender to cases of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriages not consummated where the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is requested to grant a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> for a new marriage. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the defender to appeal from the decision of first instance, adverse to the validity of a marriage, has been modified by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in several cases, where the invalidity depends upon facts indisputably proven, through the Congregation of the Holy Office (5 June, 1889) whose <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was declared (16 June, 1894) to extend to the whole Church. Where the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/14441b.htm">"Tametsi"</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> was binding, requiring the presence of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for the validity, if only a civil <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was used, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may declare the marriage null without the participation of the defender. in view of the new matrimonial legislation contained in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Ne Temere" of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> this also holds anywhere if a marriage is attempted only before a <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> or non-Catholic minister of religion. Yet if an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> form had been used, and the nullity from <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">clandestinity</a> was questioned, his presence is required; but if the impediment of <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">clandestinity</a> clearly appears he need not appeal. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> also if, through absence of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, there is an impediment of disparity of worship, or of <a href="../cathen/04264a.htm">consanguinity</a>, or of affinity from lawful intercourse, or of spiritual relationship, or of certain previous legitimate marriage still existing. In these cases the ordinary may, with the participation of the defender, declare the marriage null, and the defender is not required to appeal. This, however, was declared by the Holy Office (27 May, 1901) to be understood only of cases in which certainly and clearly the impediment is proven; otherwise the defender must proceed to the higher court. The defender is exhorted to exercise his office gratuitously, but he may be compensated from fees imposed by the court or from other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> resources.
