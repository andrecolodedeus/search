<h1>Degradation</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>degradatio</em>).

<p>A canonical penalty by which an ecclesiastic is entirely and perpetually deprived of all office, <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, dignity, and power conferred on him by <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>; and by a special <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is reduced to the state of a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, losing the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state and being given over to the secular arm. Degradation, however, cannot deprive an ecclesiastic of the character conferred in <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, nor does it dispense him from the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">law of celibacy</a> and the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. Degradation is twofold: verbal, i.e. the mere sentence of degradation; and real or actual, i.e. the execution of that sentence. They are not two distinct penalties, but parts of the same canonical punishment. Degradation is a perpetual punishment, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> so punished has never any right to release from it. It differs from deposition in so far as it deprives, and always totally, of all power of orders and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and also of the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, thus in all things subjecting the delinquent to <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>. While a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, even before his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> can inflict deposition or pronounce a sentence of verbal degradation and can reinstate those so punished, it is only a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who can inflict actual degradation, and only the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> which can reinstate <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> actually degraded.

<p>Solemn degradation owes its origin to the military practice of thus expelling soldiers from the army; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> adopted this institution in order to remove grievously delinquent <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order. The first mention of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> degradation is found in the eighty-third Novel of Justinian; subsequently it was adopted with its external solemnities by early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> councils as a repressive measure against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. It did not originally differ from deposition, and degraded <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were still privileged and remained exclusively subject to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, however, complained that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a>, even when degraded, secured in this way impunity for their crimes. Hence, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (c. viii, Decrim. falsi, X, v, 20) made it a permanent rule that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> offenders, after degradation, should be handed over to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>, to be punished according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the land. Degradation cannot be inflicted except for crimes clearly designated in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or for any other enormous crime when deposition and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> have been applied in vain, and the culprit has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> incorrigible. According to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XIII, c. iv, De ref.), a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, when inflicting degradation on a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, must have with him six mitred <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> as associate judges, and three such <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> for the degradation of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> or <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>. If <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> cannot be had, a like number of church dignitaries of mature age, and skilled in canon law, may take their place. All these must give their vote, which is decisive, and must be unanimous for the imposition of so grave a penalty.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of actual degradation consists chiefly in bringing before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior the culprit vested in the robes corresponding to his order; in gradually divesting him of his <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a>, beginning with the last he received at his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>; finally, in surrendering him to the lay judge (who must always be present) with a plea for lenient treatment and avoidance of bloodshed. The words pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior during the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, also other <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrical</a> details, are laid down by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (c. Degradatio, ii, de poenis, in VI) and by the Roman Pontifical (pt. III, c.vii). Degradation is now rarely, if ever, inflicted; dismissal, with perpetual deprivation, takes its place.
