<h1>Delcus</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of Thrace, suffragan of Philippopolis. The Greek name of the place was Delkos or Delkoi, later Derkos or Derkoi; the latter forms have prevailed. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> and common name is Derkos. It is now a little village south-west of Kara Bournou, a promontory on the Black Sea, and on the southern bank of Lake Derkos, the waters of which are brought to Constantinople by an aqueduct. There are about 300 inhabitants. The see, though some have connected its origin with the preaching of St. Andrew, is not mentioned before the eighth century; however a rather obscure record of <a href="../cathen/02226b.htm">Balsamon</a> (P.G., CXXXVII. 548) permits the supposition that it was established shortly after the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan Council of 692</a>; The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Gregory, who attended the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> in 787. In the records of the councils under Photius are found the signatures of his partisan Neophytus and of Macarius, the partisan of St. Ignatius. About 840 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> stood twentieth among the autocephalous archbishoprics. Its <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, John, subscribed a synodal sentence in 997. <a href="../cathen/02226b.htm">Balsamon</a> (P.G., CXXXVIII, 273) speaks of another <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who sought permission to reside in the larger and richer city of Phileas. Another was reproached in the Holy Synod by the Patriarch Michael with having <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> native of Constantinople and before the canonical age (ibid., 213); he was perhaps the John who was present in 1166 at the council of Constantinople, known as "Pater major me est". One Gregory subscribed another council in 1193. In 1316 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was given to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Nymph&aelig;um, who had been deprived of his own (Miklosich and M&uuml;ller, "Acta et diplomata gr&aelig;ca", I,50). Luke was <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in 1329 (ibid., 98). In 1356 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was <em>per adjunctionem</em> in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Bizye (ibid., 355). In 1365 it had again an occupant, and its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1379 and 1381 was Paul; in 1389 Joseph was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (op. cit., II, 6, 39, and 129). In 1466 it was and probably had long been ruled directly by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople [Kambouroglous, Monuments for History of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> (Gr.), II, 354]. It was not re-established until the beginning of the seventeenth century, when the titular resided at Therapia on the Bosphorus. Delcus was made a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> in 1655. In October, 1746, it was raised to the eighth rank of the Greek <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Col. concil., XXXVIII, 527). The diocese now includes 41 villages in the vicinity of Constantinople and along the shores of the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmora, among them San Stefano, Makri-Keui, and Beuyuk-D&eacute;r&eacute;, with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> conducted by <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and Minor <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>.
