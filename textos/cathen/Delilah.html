<h1>Delilah</h1>  

<p>(Or <em>Dalila</em>).

<p>Samson, sometime after his exploit at <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> (<a href="../bible/jdg016.htm#vrs1">Judges 16:1-3</a>), "loved a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who dwelt in the valley of Sorec, and she was called Delilah" (verse 4). The village of Sorec was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Onomast.), and rightly placed north of <a href="../cathen/05380a.htm">Eleutheropolis</a> near Saraa, the home of Samson. It is now called Khan Sureq. The valley of that name, mentioned in the text, was probably a little lateral valley of the great Wadi Serar, or the Wadi Serar itself (Lagrange, "Le livre des Juges", 247). The railway from <a href="../cathen/08268a.htm">Jaffa</a> to Jerusalem passes through this region a little to the west of the station of Deir Aban. The district was on the borderland between the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> and those of their principle enemies and oppressors at this period, the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>. Sorec may have been inhabited by the latter; and although it is not stated to which people Delilah belonged, the story told in this sixteenth chapter of Judges of her relations with the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, makes it vary unlikely that she was an <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelite</a>. It is not probable either that she became the wife of Samson. The expression above quoted with which Scripture introduces the narrative of her relations with him, and the facility with which the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were brought into her house, not to speak of her readiness to betray the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelite</a> hero, suggest rather that she was a harlot, an opinion that is now more common among commentators.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, thinking that the strength which had made Samson familiar to them must be due to some magical charm, seek to find out what it is. Their princes, probably the five mentioned in Judges, iii, 3, and elsewhere, coming to Delilah, to whose house Samson often resorted &#151; if he did not live there &#151; say: "Deceive him, and learn of him wherein his great strength lieth, and how we may be able to overcome him, to bind and afflict him: which if thou shalt do, we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver" (verse 5). This sum must have appeared enormous to Delilah. She undertakes to discover the secret of Samson's strength and the means to overcome it. Four different times she asks him to tell her his secret, having each time a number of <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> on hand to seize him if she can cajole him into betraying it. Samson at first indulges his humour in answers which allow him to laugh at her attempts to bind him; but finally her importunity prevails, and he tells her of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as a <a href="../cathen/10727a.htm">Nazarite</a> and of the necessity of keeping his long hair, the mark of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Delilah then causes this hair to be cut off while Samson sleeps, and hands him over to his enemies who bring him a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to Gaza.
