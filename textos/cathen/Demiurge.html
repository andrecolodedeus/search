<h1>Demiurge</h1>  

<p>The word means literally a public worker, <em>demioerg&oacute;s, demiourg&oacute;s,</em> and was originally used to designate any craftsman plying his craft or trade for the use of the public. Soon, however, <em>techn&iacute;tes</em> and other words began to be used to designate the common artisan while demiurge was set aside for the Great Artificer or Fabricator, the Architect of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. At first the words <em>to&ucirc; k&oacute;smou</em> were added to distinguish the great Workman from others, but gradually <em>demiourg&oacute;s</em> became the technical term for the Maker of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth. In this sense it is used frequently by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in his "Tim&aelig;us". Although often loosely employed by the Fathers and others to indicate the Creator, the word never strictly meant "one who produces out of nothing" (for this the Greeks used <em>kt&iacute;stes</em>), but only "one who fashions, shapes, and models". A creator in the sense of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> has no place in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> philosophy, which always presupposes the existence of matter. Moreover, according to Greek philosophy the world-maker is not necessarily identical with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as first and supreme source of all things; he may be distinct from and inferior to the supreme spirit, though he may also be the practical expression of the reason of God, the Logos as operative in the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. In this sense, i.e. that of a world-maker distinct from the Supreme God, <em>Demiurge</em> became a common term in <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, however, were not satisfied merely to emphasize the distinction between the Supreme God, or God the Father, and the Demiurge, but in many of their systems they conceived the relation of the Demiurge to the Supreme God as one of actual antagonism, and the Demiurge became the personification of the power of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, with whom the faithful had to wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to the end that they might be pleasing to the Good God. The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Demiurge then assumes a surprising likeness to <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahriman</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counter-creator of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ormuzd</a> in Mazdean philosophy. The character of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Demiurge became still more complicated when in some systems he was identified with <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and was brought in opposition to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, the Only-Begotten Son of the Supreme and Good God. The purpose of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming as Saviour and Redeemer was to rescue us from the power of the Demiurge, the lord of the world of this darkness, and bring us to the light of the Good God, His Father in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. The last development in the character of the Demiurge was due to <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a> being primarily considered as he who gave the Law on Sinai, and hence as the originator of all restraint on the human will. As the Demiurge was essentially <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, all his work was such; in consequence all law was intrinsically <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the children of the Good God was to transgress this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and to trample upon its <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>. This led to the wildest orgies of <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">Antinomian</a> <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>.

<p>According to Valentinus the Demiurge was the offspring of a union of Achamoth (<em>he k&aacute;ta soph&iacute;a</em> or lower wisdom) with matter. And as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of <em>Soph&iacute;a</em> the last of the thirty <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Propat&ocirc;r, or Supreme God. The Demiurge in creating this world out of Chaos was unconsciously influenced for good by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Soter</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>. To this <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, however, was actually united <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus the Saviour</a>, Who redeemed men. These are either <em>huliko&iacute;,</em> or <em>pneumatiko&iacute;</em>. The first, or carnal men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or psychic men, together with the Demiurge as their master, will enter a middle state, neither <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<em>pleroma</em>) nor <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> (<em>hyle</em>); the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the <em>pleroma</em> divested of body (<em>h&uacute;le</em>) and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<em>psuch&eacute;</em>). In this most common form of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> the Demiurge had an inferior though not intrinsically <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> function in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as the head of the psychic world. According to <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, the Demiurge was to be sharply distinguished from the Good God; the former was <em>d&iacute;kaios,</em> severely just, the latter <em>agath&oacute;s,</em> or loving-kind; the former was the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the latter the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though in reality the Son of the Good God, pretended to be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> of the Demiurge, the better to spread the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning His heavenly Father. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> believer in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> entered into <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">God's kingdom</a>, the unbeliever remained forever the slave of the Demiurge. To this form of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, the Demiurge has assumed already a more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> aspect. According to the Naassenes the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God of the Jews</a> is not merely <em>d&iacute;kaios,</em> but he is the great tyrant Jaldabaoth, or Son of Chaos. He is Demiurge and maker of man, but as a ray of light from above enters the body of man and gives him a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; Jaldabaoth is filled with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; he tries to limit man's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by forbidding him the fruit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>. The Demiurge, fearing lest <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom he had intended as his <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, should spread the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Supreme God, had him crucified by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. At the consummation of all things all light will return to the <em>pleroma;</em> but Jaldabaoth, the Demiurge, with the material world, will be cast into the lower depths. Some of the Ophites or Naassenes <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> reprobated in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, such as Cain, or the people of Sodom, as valiant resisters of the Demiurge. In these weird systems the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the world-maker was degraded to the uttermost. Amongst the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, however, who as a rule set some difference between the Demiurge and the Supreme God, there was one exception; for according to the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, whose opinions have come down to us in the Pseudo-Clementine literature, there is no difference between the Highest God and the Demiurge. They are identical, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who made <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth is worthy of the adoration of men. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic system</a> is tainted with <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>, and its Demiurge is not a creator but only a world-builder. (See <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">GNOSTICISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">VALENTINUS</a>; MARCION.)
