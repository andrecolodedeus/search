<h1>Demons</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>daimon</em> and <em>daimonion</em>, Latin <em>daemonium</em>).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> this word has come to mean much the same as <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm"><em>devil</em></a> and denotes one of the evil spirits or fallen <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And in fact in some places in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> where the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, in agreement with the Greek, has <em>daemonium</em>, our vernacular versions read <em>devil</em>. The precise distinction between the two terms in ecclesiastical usage may be seen in the phrase used in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a>: "Diabolus enim et alii daemones" (The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and the other demons), i.e. all are demons, and the chief of the demons is called the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. This distinction is observed in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, where <em>diabolus</em> represents the Greek <em>diabolos</em> and in almost every instance refers to Satan himself, while his subordinate <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are described, in accordance with the Greek, as <em>daemones</em> or <em>daemonia</em>. This must not be taken, however, to indicate a difference of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; for Satan is clearly included among the <em>daemones</em> in <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#vrs19">James 2:19</a> and in <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs15">Luke 11:15-18</a>.

<p>But though the word <em>demon</em> is now practically restricted to this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">sinister</a> sense, it was otherwise with the earlier usage of the Greek writers. The word, which is apparently derived from <em>daio</em> "to divide" or "apportion", originally meant a divine being; it was occasionally applied to the higher gods and goddesses, but was more generally used to denote spiritual beings of a lower order coming between gods and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For the most part these were beneficent beings, and their office was somewhat analogous to that of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Thus the adjective <em>eydaimon</em> "happy", properly meant one who was guided and guarded by a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> demon. Some of these Greek demons, however, were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and malignant. Hence we have the counterpart to <em>eudamonia</em> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">"happiness"</a>, in <em>kakodaimonia</em> which denoted misfortune, or in its more original meaning, being under the possession of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> demon. In the Greek of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and in the language of the early Fathers, the word was already restricted to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">sinister</a> sense, which was natural enough, now that even the higher gods of the Greeks had come to be regarded as <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a>.

<p>We have a curious instance of the confusion <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the ambiguity and variations in the meaning of the word, in the case of the celebrated "Daemon" of <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>. This has been understood in a bad sense by some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers who have made it a matter of reproach that the great Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> was accompanied and prompted by a demon. But, as <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> clearly shows in his paper on the subject, the word here has a very different meaning. He points to the fact that both <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Xenophon use the form <em>daimonion</em>, which Cicero rightly renders as <em>divinum aliguid</em>, "something divine". And after a close examination of the account of the matter given by <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> himself in the reports transmitted by his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he concludes that the promptings of the "Daemon" were the dictates of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, which is the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>It may be observed that a similar change and deterioration of meaning has taken place in the Iranian languages in the case of the word <em>daeva</em>. Etymologically this is identical with the Sanskrit <em>deva</em>, by which it is rendered in Neriosengh's version of the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a>. But whereas the devas of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">Indian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and beneficent gods, the daevas of the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> are <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateful</a> <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.
