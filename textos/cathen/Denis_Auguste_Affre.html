<h1>Denis Auguste Affre</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, b. at St. Rome-de-Tam, in the Department of Tam, 27 September, 1793; d. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 27 June, 1848. At the age of fourteen he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Saint Sulpice, then under the direction of his uncle, Denis Boyer. He completed his studies with great credit, and spent some time as professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 16 May, 1818, and joined the Sulpician community. He was successively <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/09413a.htm">Lu&ccedil;on</a> and Amiens, and was appointed Coadjutor of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> in 1839. This post, however, he never filled, being called on to act as Vicar-Capitular of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, conjointly with MM. Auger and Morel, at the death of Archbishop Qu&eacute;len. Five months later he was nominated to the vacant see (1840). His tenure of this office was marked by a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> devotion to the improvement of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> studies and to the free exercise of the teaching office (<em>libert&eacute; d'enseignement</em>). During the insurrection of 1848 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> was led to believe that his presence at the barricades might be the means of restoring peace. He accordingly applied to General Cavaignac, who warned him of the risk he was about to incur. "My life", the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> answered, "is of little value, I will gladly risk it." Soon afterwards, the firing having ceased at his request, he appeared on the barricade at the entrance to the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, accompanied by M. Albert, of the national guard, who wore the dress of a workingman, and bore a green branch as a sign of peace, and by Tellier, a devoted servant. His reception was not very favorable, and he had spoken only a few words, when the insurgents, hearing some shots, and thinking they were betrayed, opened fire on the National Guard, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> fell. He was removed to his palace, where he died. Next day the National Assembly issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> expressing their great sorrow at his death. The public funeral, 7 July, was one of the most striking spectacles of its kind. Archbishop Affre wrote, in addition to his pastorals and various articles in "La France Chr&eacute;tienne", "Trait&eacute; de l'administration temporelle des paroisses" (Paris, 1827; 11th ed., 1890), "Trait&eacute; de la propri&eacute;t&eacute; des biens eccl&eacute;siastiques" (Paris, 1837), "Introduction philosophique &agrave; l'&eacute;tude du Christianisme" (Paris, 5th ed., 1846).
