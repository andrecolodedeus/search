<h1>Denis Mary Bradley</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> b. 25 February, 1846, at Castle-island, County Kerry, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> 13 December, 1903. Shortly after his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death his mother, with a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of five, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and settled at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>. He was then eight years old. After attending the local <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, he was sent to Holy Cross College, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, in 1863, and closed his academic career there in June, 1867. He was then enrolled as an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> student at St. Joseph's Seminary, Troy, New York, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 3 June, 1871. Shortly after this he was located at <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, under <a href="../cathen/02191a.htm">Bishop Bacon</a>, and subsequently under Bishop Healy, by whom he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In June, 1881, he was made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Joseph's, <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, which became his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> when he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">See of Manchester</a>, 11 June, 1884. He had the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being the first alumnus of St. Joseph's Seminary of Troy, New York, to be raised to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>.

<p>In the rural sections of <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a> thee were many scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who up to that time had few facilities for practising their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and his first and earnest efforts were directed towards providing for them, and with the most gratifying results. He held the first synod of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> 24 October, 1886, and under the energizing influence of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and enthusiasm there was a general upbuilding of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> throughout the State. The silver jubilee of his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> was made the occasion of a striking demonstration of his great personal popularity, and this had another manifestation when every non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> in Manchester bore sincere testimony to the loss his death had occasioned to the city and to the State.
