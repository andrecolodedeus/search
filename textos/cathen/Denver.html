<h1>Denver</h1>  

<p>(D<font size=-2>ENVERIENSIS</font>).

<p>A suffragan of the Archdiocese of Santa F&eacute;, erected in 1887 and comprising the entire <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">State of Colorado</a>, an area of 103,645 square miles.

<p>The first permanent civilized settlement within its borders was made in 1852, when a Spanish colony from <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> settled in what is now the southern part of <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a> on the Conejos River, where they built the first church in 1858. Similar settlements followed during the fifties, their spiritual needs being provided for by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, sent by Bishop Lamy of Santa F&eacute;, whose diocese then extended as far north as the Arkansas River, the boundary of the Mexican cession. The discovery of gold, in 1858, near the site of the present city of <a href="../cathen/04733c.htm">Denver</a>, soon brought a great increase of population from the Eastern States. Mining camps and towns sprang up in great numbers throughout the whole Pike's Peak region. This territory was then a part of the vicariate of Bishop Mi&egrave;ge of <a href="../cathen/09102b.htm">Leavenworth</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> visited Denver in 1860. Finding it practically impossible to attend these distant missions, Bishop Mi&egrave;ge secured their transfer to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Santa F&eacute;. Bishop Lamy sent his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the Very Rev. Joseph P Machebeuf, and a young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Rev, John B. Raverdy, to care for the mining regions and the new settlements. Father Machebeuf had spent eleven years in the missions of Northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, and ten years in similar work in <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> and Arizona, and was thus admirably adapted for the work before him. The two missionaries arrived at Denver in October, 1860, and for over seven years they laboured, almost unaided, visiting the immense territory confided to them, building churches wherever the prospects warranted such an undertaking.

<p>The increase of population was so great during those early years, and the prospects of permanency became so favourable that the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> recommended to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the creation of the Vicariate Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a> and <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>. Consequently Father Machebeuf was nominated to that office and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05503a.htm">Epiphania</a> at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> by <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a>, 16 August, 1868. The new <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was born 11 August, 1812, at Riom, Puy-de-Dome, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 21 December, 1836, at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont-Ferrand</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of his native diocese. When he took charge as Vicar Apostolic he had but three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> within his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but he returned to the field of his work and redoubled his own efforts, visiting every portion of his vast vicariate, doing the work of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and endeavouring at the same time to secure <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the rapidly increasing population. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for religion was shown also by his many efforts to secure locations for future churches, charitable and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>, several of which were built in his own time &mdash; notably, the Loretto Academy at Denver, in 1864, and later St. Joseph's Hospital, the House of the Good Shepherd, and the College of the Sacred Heart. In 1871 his burdens were somewhat lightened by the transfer of the Territory of <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>.

<p>By <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 16 August, 1887, the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a> was made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at Denver; and the Rev. Nicholas C. Matz appointed coadjutor with right of succession (19 August, 1887). He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Telmessa, at Denver, by Archbishop Salpointe of Santa F&eacute;, 28 October, 1887. Bishop Machebeuf nevertheless relaxed but little of his missionary work after this, and retained the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> until his death, on 10 July, 1889, leaving in the diocese 34 secular and 30 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 112 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 1 college, 9 academies, 9 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 2 asylums, and over 3000 children in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>Bishop Matz, who was born 6 April, 1850, at Munster, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Denver, 31 May, 1874, continued the good work of his predecessor.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains (1908) 62 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 71 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders: <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work, 2 colleges for young men with 261 students, 531 religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of 15 different institutes: the Sisters of Loretto, Charity (Mt. St. Joseph, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>), Charity (Leavenworth, Kansas), <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, Mercy, the Good Shepherd, Third <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, St. Francis, St. Benedict (Chicago, Illinois), Charity B.V.M. (Dubuque, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>), St. Francis of the Perpetual Adoration, Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart, St. Benedict (Erie, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>), St. Joseph (Wichita, Kansas), <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>. There are 4 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> with 588 children; an industrial and reform <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with 225 inmates, a home, 15 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> with 11,300 patients annually, 10 academies with 900 pupils and 25 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 6600 children. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students number 10. There are 60 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 91 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 140 stations, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 99, 485. The Sacred Heart Orphanage at Pueblo sheltering 150 children, owes its existence and partial endowment to the generosity of Captain John J. Lambert of Pueblo, an exemplary <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> prominent in <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. The English language is generally used, but in many of the mining districts and industrial centres there is a necessity for the Italian and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> languages, while Spanish is usually spoken in the southern <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. There is no <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, and the individual churches and institutions are solvent and prosperous.
