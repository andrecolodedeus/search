<h1>Deposition</h1>  

<p>A deposition is an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vindictive penalty by which a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> is forever deprived of his office or <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> and of the right of exercising the functions of his orders. Of its own nature this punishment is perpetual and irremissible in the sense that those on whom it is inflicted, even after having done full penance, have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to be released from it, though the superior may, if he wishes, reinstate them if truly amended. Deposition can be inflicted only on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, secular or regular; it may be either total or partial, according as it deprives them of all powers of orders and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> or of only a portion of them. It differs from simple privation because in addition to the deprivation of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and offices it disqualifies an ecclesiastic from obtaining them in future; from suspension because it is always a perpetual vindictive penalty, not a mere suspension of the use of the powers of orders and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but an entire and perpetual withdrawal of them; from actual degradation in as much as it never deprives of the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>.

<p>This punishment can be traced to the early centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> when <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> guilty of heinous crimes were expelled from their rank and removed to lay communion. Although preserving the character of their orders, they were then considered, for all purposes and in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, as ordinary <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and were bound to appear with the ordinary faithful when receiving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. The word <em>deposition</em>, it is alleged, was first used in the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Synod of Agde</a> (506, can. xxxv) to indicate such a penalty. Down to the twelfth century the expressions <em>deposition</em> and <em>degradation</em> meant one and the same canonical punishment. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, for instance, that Paul, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> (541), and Ignatius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (861), met with the same kind of punishment; yet in the first case it is styled deposition and in the second degradation. Moreover, deposition always deprived <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of the office they held by the ordinary title of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and it was nearly always coupled with the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of divesting delinquents of the garments used in the functions of their sacred ministry. In process of time, when, first by custom and subsequently by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (c. At si clericis, IV, De judiciis), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were allowed to dispense from that penalty in crimes of lesser gravity than <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, the solemn stripping of the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a> was discontinued, to save the trouble of restoring their use in case of reinstatement. The new practice created uncertainty and variety in the execution of deposition, hence <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (c. ii. De p&oelig;nis, in VI&#186;) at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of B&eacute;ziers decreed that the formal removal of vestments, which now means and effects total exclusion from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, was to take place only in cases of actual degradation.

<p>As stated above, total deposition prohibits the exercise of powers conferred by <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and effects a complete and perpetual deprivation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices, <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and dignities. It also disqualifies from obtaining them in future, while public disgrace or <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> and irregularity are inflicted on those who disregard this punishment. The character impressed by <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> being indelible, deposition from orders can only deprive a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the right of exercising them. Deposition from office always effects the loss of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> annexed to it, as <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> are given on account of the spiritual office. On the other hand, deposition from <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> never renders an ecclesiastic incapable of licitly exercising his ministry; it is maintained, however, that it deprives him even of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to a share of the temporal emoluments for his decent support. According to the present <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> deposition is inflicted only for enormous crimes, such as cause <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">public scandal</a> and do great harm to religion or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, e.g. <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, public <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and incorrigible tenor of life, etc. It is largely left, however, to the prudent judgment of the superior to determine in each case the gravity of the crime which deserves this punishment. In fact, deposition is now rarely inflicted; simple dismissal, together with perpetual suspension, usually takes its place. (See <a href="../cathen/09093b.htm">LAY COMMUNION</a>.)
