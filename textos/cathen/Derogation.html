<h1>Derogation</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>derogatio</em>).

<p>The partial revocation of a law, as opposed to abrogation or the total abolition of a law. This definition of derogation first introduced by the Roman jurisconsult Modestinus (XVI, 102, De verb. significatione) was soon adopted in the canonical legislation. Even yet, however, derogation in a loose sense means also abrogation, hence the common saying: <em>Lex posterior derogat priori</em>, i.e. a subsequent law imports the abolition of a previous one. Dispensation differs from derogation principally in the fact that the latter affects the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> itself which is thereby partially revoked, while the former affects the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> bound by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, from whose <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> some of them are in particular cases totally or partially released. Derogation is often accomplished by special clauses inserted in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents, e.g. <em>Non obstantibus</em> etc. (see <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">RESCRIPTS</a>). The absence of such derogatory clauses as are always employed in <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">papal rescripts</a> makes them defective in form. The following rules are helpful for the interpretation of derogations: <ul><li>Apart from special cases, derogations are to be strictly interpreted, any correction of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> being regularly of an odious nature. <li>A simple derogation, that imposes no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> contrary to that of the existing law, does not require a formal <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>. <li>No clause expressly derogatory of the existing law is requisite in making derogations from any kind of general ecclesiastical laws; exception is made only when it is proposed to derogate from the rules of the Apostolic Chancery. <li>Derogations couched in general terms are not upheld; they must be made in specific and formal terms. <li>The rule of law that a special enactment is derogatory of the previous general one (<em>Generi derogatur per speciem</em>; Reg. 34 in VI) means that a particular law which is a derogation of a general one must always produce its derogatory effect, it being immaterial whether it was issued before the general law or after it. In the latter case the special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is maintained as it was intentionally made by the competent superior; nor in the former instance does it lose its value, because the superior had no intention of abolishing it by a subsequent general law, it being a presumption that superiors are not cognizant of particular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> or customs. (see CUSTOM; <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">LAW</a>).</ul>
