<h1>Derry (Deria)</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF DERRY (DERRIENSIS).

<p>Includes nearly all the County Derry, part of Donegal, and a large portion of Tyrone, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; it is a suffragan of Armagh. The diocese owes its origin to the monastic establishment founded there by St. Columba between 546 and 562. But there does not seem to have been a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> resident at Derry before Gervase O'Cervallen (c. 1230). The entry in the "Annals" by which O'Brolchain is represented as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Derry is due to a mistranslation. He was merely the superior of the Columban <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastic houses</a>, and was accorded the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a seat in the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The present Diocese of Derry was formed by a union of the old Sees of Rathlure and Ardstraw founded by St. Eugene, at what time cannot be accurately determined, and it was fully defined about the middle of the thirteenth century. The ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Derry was one of the most important in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and eventually the chief house of the Columban <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Gilla MacLeag (Gelasius) who succeeded <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a> as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a> (1136) had been <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>.

<p>After the formation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the thirteenth century the succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was uninterrupted till the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period. Redmond O'Gallagher, appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1569, was one of the leading <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in the province of Armagh at that period. He was appointed Administrator of Armagh during the absence of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> in 1575, and according to a State paper (1592) he seems to have been the most active upholder of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Ulster. He was killed by a body of soldiers in 1601. From 1601 till 1683 the Diocese of Derry was administered by vicars. From the appointment of Bernard O'Cahan in 1683, the line of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in Derry has been continued without interruption.

<p>The population of Derry according to the census of 1901 was 222,505, 127,387 of whom were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It is divided into thirty-nine <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, two of these being mensal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; the remainder are held by <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is about 108. There is no chapter (1908), nor is there any house of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the diocese. The seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is in the city of Derry where are also situated the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and St. Columb's College which serves at the same time the purpose of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and a general intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and is one of the most successful <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. There is also a flourishing intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Omagh conducted by the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Irish Christian Brothers</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> have <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in Derry, Moville, Strabane, and Carndonagh; the Loretto Community have a house at Omagh, while the Sisters of Nazareth conduct a home for the aged of both sexes and one for children in Derry. The primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are conducted according to the rules of the Board of National Education, while the Model Schools in Derry have been completely <a href="../cathen/16012a.htm">boycotted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population.
