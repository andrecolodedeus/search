<h1>Desertion</h1>  

<p>The culpable abandonment of a state, of a stable situation, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of which one had freely accepted. In civil life the word usually designates the offence committed by a soldier who, by flight, forsakes his military <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. As regards Christian life, desertion may have for its object any state, from the highest to the lowliest, to which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> may be called. The first kind of desertion is the abandonment of the state and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> imposed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and is known as apostasy (<em>apostasia a fide</em>). A second kind of desertion is when the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> has been admitted by <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and thereafter abandons his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state and its <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> (<em>apostasia ab ordine</em>). The abandonment of the religious state is still another kind of apostasy (<em>apostasia a religione</em>). (See <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">APOSTASY</a>.) But this expression is used only in connexion with those orders which take solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; abandonment of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> as followed in congregations under simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, is mere desertion, although by some it is incorrectly designated as apostasy. This desertion does not incur the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to which religious <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> are sentenced, though it entails suspension for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> (Decr. Auctis admodum of the S.C. of Bishops and Regulars, 4 Nov., 1892), and generally terminates in dismissal or expulsion.

<p>The term <em>desertion</em> is also applied to a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric's</a> abandonment of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, whether it be residential or non-residential. If the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> be residential, there is occasion to proceed against the culprit according to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, c. i; Sess. XXIII, c. i; Sess. XXIV, c. xii). The first text applies to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and provides that, after six months, the absent <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> be deprived <em>ipso facto</em> of a quarter of the annual revenue of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>; that if he remain absent for six additional months he be denied another quarter's revenue and finally, that if he fail to return to his charge the metropolitan or the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> must denounce him to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> within three months, and his punishment may even amount to the privation of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. The second text concerns <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> having the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: it deprives the guilty party of the revenue of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> in proportion to the length of absence; at the same time the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can proceed against the absentee by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures, and finally deprive him of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> if he does not return within six months after receiving a warning or official summons. The third text relates to canons and other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who possess even a simple <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> them to residence for the choir-office, the celebration of Mass and other analogous charges: the absentee loses <em>ipso facto</em> the daily distributions (see <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">BENEFICE</a>); the number of days of absence may not exceed three months in any year; otherwise he forfeits half the revenue of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>; if he repeats the offence a second year, he forfeits all the revenue; and if his absence be still prolonged he can be deprived of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> by canonical sentence. For the very rare case of non-residential <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> which the beneficiary has totally abandoned, canonists consider that it becomes vacant after ten years, according to the terms of c. viii, De cler. non resid., III, tit. iv.

<p>In judicial matters there is desertion of suit or of appeal when the plaintiff, after instituting a proceeding or lodging an appeal, fails to comply within the required time with the judicial acts demanded by the court. In the first instance, the judge, having established the neglect of the plaintiff, declares the suit abandoned. The judge from whom appeal is taken should appoint a time for the apellant to present his appeal to the new judge (c. xxxiii, and Clem., iv, De appell., II, tit. xxviii). The appeal should be terminated within a year or two (c. v, and Clem., iii, De appell.). However, this system is not strictly observed.

<p>Finally, since the married state supposes that man and wife dwell together, desertion is the unjustified abandonment of the conjugal domicile by one or the other, especially by the wife who is bound to follow her husband to his new domicile. This desertion, which recent civil legislation considers a legitimate cause for separation and even for <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, is considered by canon law merely a delict that gives the deserted party the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to recall the fugitive through judicial authority, either <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or secular (c. xiii, De restit. spol., II tit. xiii). If the wife separates for a legitimate reason, on account of the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of her husband, because of ill-treatment by him or in order to escape a serious danger that would result from continued dwelling with him, such desertion is not held to be malicious; it is, however, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the proper judge to pass upon it.
