<h1>Desservants</h1>  

<p>The name of a class of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Under the old regime, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who performed the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in a vacant <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, or where the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was under censure of some kind (H&eacute;ricourt, Les lois ecclesiastiques de France, II, xv, Paris, 1771) was known as a <em>desservant</em>; he was the vicar, or <em>&eacute;conome-cur&eacute;</em>, whom the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, c. xviii, De ref.) desired to be appointed in each vacant <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, however, the name <em>desservants</em> was applied to a second class of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were named by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without the sanction of the Government, but could also be removed at any time by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This institution owed its origin to custom rather than any law, though later on it was fully legalized. Article 9 of the new concordat decreed that "the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are to make a new circumscription of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, which will only go into effect after the consent of the Government is obtained". Article 10 adds: "bishops shall make the appointments to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; they shall choose only <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> approved by the Government." Finally, art. 14 provides "a suitable salary for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>". These clauses applied to only one kind of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a>, added by the Government to the concordat, established <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of a second order, succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (mission churches), whose titulars were not canonically <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (<em>cur&eacute;s</em>) and received no remuneration from the State. <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a> 31, 60, 61, 63 provide that "there shall be at least one parish for every justice of the peace", that "the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in conjunction with the prefect shall regulate the number and extent of succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>"; that "the officiating <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> shall be appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>"; that they shall also be removable by him; preference nevertheless should be given to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> pensioned by the Assemblee Constituante (art. 68). By degrees the succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> increased and equalled in number the municipalities of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; gradually, also, the Government allowed these desservants a small salary. From an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> point of view, they were <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> except for the removability clause.

<p>This condition of affairs, which the concordat had not anticipated, was advantageous to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because it left the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> free to appoint to most <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> without consulting the State; it was also of advantage to the episcopal administration, which would have been much hampered had all the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> been irremovable. It was not formally approved by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, however, until May, 1845, under <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> (reply of the Congregation of the Council to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> authorized the continuance of the existing situation until the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> decided otherwise. From various quarters, however, arose protests in favour of canonical irremovability of the desservants. In 1839 the Allignol brothers published "De l'&eacute;tat actuel du clerg&eacute; de France, et en particulier des cur&eacute;s ruraux, appel&eacute;s desservants" (The present condition of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, particularly of the rural <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, known as desservants). It was the cause of several meetings of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and finally of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. Later on (5 Oct., 1864) the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars reproved a similar work by the Abb&eacute; Dagomer, "R&eacute;habilitation du desservant". Occasionally, some of the desservants refused to give up their places at the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> order, maintaining a common-law right of irremovability; but in this they were always unsuccessful. In this respect the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had become fixed and accepted; nor was it modified by the Separation Law of 1905; except that some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have ceased to use the terms <em>succursale</em> and <em>desservant</em>, replacing them by <em><a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a></em> and <em><a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a></em>, both, however, long since in ordinary <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> use.
