<h1>Detraction</h1>  

<p>(From Latin <em>detrahere</em>, to take away).

<p>Detraction is the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> damaging of another's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a> by the revelation of some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">fault or crime</a> of which that other is really guilty or at any rate is seriously <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be guilty by the defamer.

<p>An important difference between detraction and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> is at once apparent. The <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniator</a> says what he knows to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, whilst the detractor narrates what he at least honestly thinks is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Detraction in a general sense is a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as being a violation of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not only of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> but also of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. It is obvious, however, that the subject-matter of the accusation may be so inconspicuous or, everything considered, so little capable of doing serious hurt that the guilt is not assumed to be more than venial. The same judgment is to be given when, as not unfrequently happens, there has been little or no advertence to the harm that is being done.

<p>The determination of the degree of sinfulness of detraction is in general to be gathered from the consideration of the amount of harm the defamatory utterance is calculated to work. In order to adequately measure the seriousness of the damage wrought, due regard must be had not only to the imputation itself but also to the character of the person by whom and against whom the charge is made. That is, we must take into account not only the greater or lesser criminality of the thing alleged but also the more or less distinguished <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of the detractor for trustworthiness, as well as the more or less notable dignity or estimation of the person whose <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a> has been assailed. Thus it is conceivable that a relatively small defect alleged against a person of eminent station, such as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, might seriously tarnish his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a> and be a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whilst an offence of considerable magnitude attributed to an individual of a class in which such things frequently happen might constitute only a venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, such as, for instance, to say that a common sailor had been drunk. It is worthy of note that the manifestation of even inculpable defects may be a real defamation, such as to charge a person with gross <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, etc. When this is done in such circumstances as to bring upon the person so disparaged a more than ordinary measure of disgrace, or perhaps seriously prejudice him, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may even be a grievous one.

<p>There are times, nevertheless, when one may lawfully make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the offense of another even though as a consequence the trust hitherto reposed in him be rudely shaken or shattered. If a person's misdoing is public in the sense that sentence has been passed by the competent legal tribunal or that it is already <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>, for instance, in a city, then in the first case it may licitly be referred to in any place; in the second, within the limits of the town, or even elsewhere, unless in either instance the offender in the lapse of time should have entirely reformed or his delinquency been quite forgotten. When, however, knowledge of the happening is possessed only by the members of a particular community or society, such as a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> or <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastery</a> and the like, it would not be lawful to publish the fact to others than those belonging to such a body. Finally, even when the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is in no sense public, it may still be divulged without contravening the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a> whenever such a course is for the common <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">weal</a> or is esteemed to make for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of the narrator, of his listeners, or even of the culprit. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> which the latter has to an assumed <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a> is extinguished in the presence of the benefit which may be conferred in this way.

<p>The employment of this teaching, however, is limited by a twofold restriction.

<ul>
<li>The damage which one may soberly apprehend as emerging from the failure to reveal another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vicious</a> propensity must be a notable one as contrasted with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of defamation.
<li>No more in the way of exposure should be done than is required, and even a <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">fraternal admonition</a> ought rather to be substituted if it can be discerned to adequately meet the needs of the situation.</ul>

<p>Journalists are entirely within their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in inveighing against the official shortcomings of public men. Likewise, they may lawfully present whatever information about the life or character of a candidate for public office is necessary to show his unfitness for the station he seeks. Historians have a still greater latitude in the performance of their task. This is not of course because the dead have lost their claim to have their <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a> respected. History must be something more than a mere calendar of dates and incidents; the causes and connection of events are a proper part of its province. This consideration, as well as that of the general utility in elevating and strengthening the public <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, may justify the historian in telling many things hitherto unknown which are to the disgrace of those of whom they are related.

<p>Those who abet another's defamation in a matter of moment by directly or indirectly inciting or encouraging the principal in the case are guilty of grievous <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. When, however, one's attitude is simply a passive one, i.e. that of a mere listener, prescinding from any interior satisfaction at the blackening of another's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">good name</a>, ordinarily the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not mortal unless one happens to be a superior. The reason is that private persons are seldom obliged to administer <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">fraternal correction</a> under pain of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04394a.htm">FRATERNAL CORRECTION</a>). The detractor having violated an unimpeachable <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of another is bound to <a href="../cathen/12788a.htm">restitution</a>. He must do his best to put back the one whom he has thus outraged in possession of the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">fair fame</a> which the latter hitherto enjoyed. He must likewise <a href="../cathen/12788a.htm">make good</a> whatever other loss he in some measure foresaw his victim would sustain as a result of this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unfair</a> defamation, such as damage measurable in terms of money. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in either instance is perfectly clear. The method of discharging this plain <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is not so obvious in the first case. In fact, since the thing alleged is assumed to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it cannot be formally taken back, and some of the suggestions of theologians as to the style of reparation are more ingenious than satisfactory. Generally the only thing that can be done is to bide one's time until an occasion presents itself for a favorable characterization of the person defamed. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the detractor to make compensation for pecuniary loss and the like is not only personal but becomes a burden on his heirs as well.
