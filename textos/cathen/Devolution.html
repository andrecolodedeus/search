<h1>Devolution</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>devolutio</em> from <em>devolvere</em>)

<p>Devolution is the right of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior to provide for a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, when the ordinary patron or collator has failed to do so, either through negligence or by the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of an improper candidate. There is no permanent loss of right in such a case, but only for the time being and for that particular instance. The right of devolution passes to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> when the chapter or private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> who have the right of patronage do not present a new and acceptable beneficiary within six months of the vacancy. When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself is negligent, the right devolves upon the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. Where, however, the right of appointing belongs to both the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the chapter, if only one of the parties has been found wanting in the exercise of the right, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> declares that the power of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> remains to the other. When there is a vacancy in an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> appoints a <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> to rule the vacant diocese, if the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter has failed to elect such an official within eight days. In case of negligence on the part of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> or exempt <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the right devolves upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of providing for the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> not conferred within the legal time or when the election was uncanonical. Chapters having power to elect an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> must do so within three months, or the appointment devolves upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>. The same holds for the case where an election was not celebrated according to canonical prescriptions. Custom, however, allows a second election by the chapter when the first has been declared void. In countries where a concordat exists between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the civil government, the right of devolution is often either to be held in abeyance or certain restrictions are placed upon it. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> no right of devolution was recognized by the State. In some ecclesiastical provinces of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, it is expressly stipulated that in the event of an uncanonical election of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the chapters are to be allowed to proceed to another election. In case the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> to <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> has been conceded to the civil government, the latter does not lose the right by the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of an unacceptable candidate, nor does the election devolve upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> when a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> has not been filled within the canonical term of three months, unless such has been expressly stipulated in the concordat. When the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, himself, does not exercise the right of devolution within the canonical term of months, the power of conferring the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> returns to the ordinary patron. Canonists deduce this conclusion not from any explicit law, but from the common regulations governing the provisions for filling <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and dignities. In practice this custom is observed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Historically, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of devolution does not seem to be more ancient than the Third Council of the Lateran (1179) for <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215) for elective prelacies. The object of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is both to provide through higher authority a remedy for the correction of abuses or negligences on the part of inferiors and also to punish them for the improper use of their powers.
