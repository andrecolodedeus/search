<h1>Diakov&aacute;r</h1>  

<p>(Croatian, <em>Djakovo</em>).

<p>See of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the united Dioceses of Bosnia or Diakov&aacute;r and Syrmia (Szerem) (Bosniensis seu Diacovensis et Sirmiensis), a municipality of Slavonia (Austria-Hungary), in the county of Virovititz (Hungarian Verocze). Diakov&aacute;r is also the seat of a district court; in 1900 it contained 6824 inhabitants, mostly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, of whom 65 per cent were Serbs and 28 per cent Germans. The fine <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, completed in 1883 by <a href="../cathen/13546a.htm">Friedrich Schmidt</a> from the plans of Karl R&ouml;sner, is a Romanesque-Gothic edifice, 256 feet long and 197 feet wide; it has two towers, each about 276 feet high, and, in addition, a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> about 203 feet high. The interior is decorated with frescoes by <a href="../cathen/13687d.htm">Seitz</a>, father and son, and the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> has 3000 pipes. Among the other important buildings are the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> founded by Bishop Mandic in 1807 and altered in 1858 by Bishop Strossmayer, the provincial house of the Sisters of Charity of the Holy Cross, and the episcopal palace. Diakov&aacute;r is of Roman origin. On the imperial road from Sissek to <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> there was a large station named Certissa, which disappeared during the migrations of the fourth and fifth centuries. The site is not again mentioned before the thirteenth century, when Coloman, brother of King B&eacute;la IV, gave the "Possessio Diaco" to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bosnia. After the re-establishment of the Diocese of Syrmia (q.v.) by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, 20 January, 1229, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> lived at Bosna Seraj in Bosnia, but in 1246 he transferred his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Diakov&aacute;r after <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, on account of the troubles with the Bogomili, withdrew the <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Diocese of Bosnia</a> from its subjection to the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/12633c.htm">Ragusa</a> and made it a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Kalocsa.

<p>In 1735 the territory of the <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Diocese of Bosnia</a> became the Vicariate Apostolic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> of 9 July, 1773, the See of Syrmia was united in perpetuity with Diakov&aacute;r. Since this date the Bishops of Diakov&aacute;r have borne the title "of Bosnia, or Diakov&aacute;r and Syrmia". Since 1852 the diocese has been a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Agram (Z&aacute;gr&aacute;b)</a>, which was founded in that year.

<p>Among the most important <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Diakov&aacute;r were Blessed Johannes Teutonicus (1233-41) who died in 1253 as fourth Master General of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Blessed Peregrinus (1349-56). In the nineteenth century Bishop Joseph Georg Strossmayer exceeded all his predecessors, not only in the length of his episcopate (1849-1905), but also in the fruitful results of his labours for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, especially as a patron of art and learning. After his death the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was administered by the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>, Dr. Engelbert Vorsak. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, established in 1239, disappeared after the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1453. It was restored in 1773 by <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Teresa</a> and it consists of 8 regular and 6 honorary canons. Since 1881 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is limited to the Croatian-Slavonian counties of Verovititz (Verocze), Szer&eacute;m, and Pozhega, and includes, according to the statistics for 1908: 4 archdeaconries; 11 vice-archdeaconries; 90 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 376 dependent <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and stations, and 4 expositures; 174 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> priests; 294,674 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 6205 <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Greeks in a total population of 515,897. The male <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Esseg (Eszek or Osjek) with 6 religious. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> communities include 37 <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and 39 Sisters of Charity of the Holy Cross. Besides the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Diakov&aacute;r, mentioned above, there is a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys at Esseg established by Bishop Strossmayer in 1899. The most celebrated place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in the Diocese of Diakov&aacute;r is Mariaschnee near Peterwardein. The <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> for Diakov&aacute;r is St. Elias, for Szerem, <a href="../cathen/04706b.htm">St. Demetrius</a>.
