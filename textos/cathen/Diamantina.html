<h1>Diamantina</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF DIAMANTINA (ADAMANTINA).

<p>Located in the north of the State of Minas Geraes, <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, South America; created under the <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazilian</a> Empire, 10 Aug., 1853, and confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, 6 June, 1854. This territory was part of the ancient Diocese of Marianna (now the Archdiocese of Minas Geraes), which had four suffragans: Marianna, Diamantina, Pouso Alegre and Uberaba, in the centre, north, south and far west of the State of Minas Geraes. The present territory comprises twenty municipalities or townships divided in 106 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 173 districts (an area of 33,708 square miles or half the territory of the State of Minas). According to the last official census (31 Dec., 1900) the population of the Diocese of Diamantina was 829,018. There are about 200 churches in as many villages and towns; and 100 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, belonging to the regular and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. A <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college (recognized by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Federal Government, and modeled on the National Gymnasium of Rio de Janeiro) are directed by the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for girls, also in Diamantina, and directed by religious, are the principal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> missionaries in Montes Claros, and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in Theophilo Ottoni and Itambacury, are engaged in Christianizing the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> of Botocudos. About 7,000 have been converted along the Mucury River, and in the mountains of Aimores and forests of Itambacury. In addition to these there are <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> in Curvello and a few (Spanish and Italian) <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>Charity <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> (Diamantina, 2, Curvelho, 1, Montes Claros, 1 Serro, 1 Conceicao, 1) are attended by the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and of Our Lady of Providence. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leagues, charitable <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> and confraternities are organized in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; and there is an institution at Serro for invalid or poor <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. There were formerly two missions, in Poaya (forests of Urupuca river and Suassuhy-Grande) and in Figueira (Dom Manoel Harbour), and Indian <em>aldeamentos</em> which prospered under the apostolical <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Italian <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries.

<p>Since its erection the Diocese of Diamantina has had three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The first was the Right Rev. Marcos Cardoso de Paiva (a native of Rio de Janeiro). His successor was the <a href="../cathen/13464a.htm">Right Rev. Jo&atilde;o Antonio dos Santos</a> who died in Diamantina, 17 May, 1905, after an <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> of forty-one years. Born in the village of Rio Preto, 1819, he served as professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Marianna before his appointment as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Diamantina, 1 May, 1864. During the last years of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> named as his coadjutor the Right Rev. J. Silverio de Sousa who succeeded him, having been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bagis, 2 Feb., 1902. He was the author of "Sitios e Personagens", "O Lar Catholico", "Novenas do Natal e da Immaculada Conceicao", "Finezas de Mae e Pastoraes", all well known works published in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is represented by two periodicals "Estrella Polar" (official) of Diamantina, and "A Verdade", of Montes-Claros. The latter is in charge of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
