<h1>Diario Romano</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/08245a.htm">Italian</a> for "Roman Daybook")

<p>A booklet published annually at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authorization, giving the routine of feasts and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> to be observed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions to be performed in the city.

<p>The Diario for 1908 gives the days on which the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> &#151; Index, Rites, <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, etc. &#151; hold their sessions. A table is then given for the ringing of the bell for evening Angelus, which varies with the time of sunset, and ranges from 5.15 p.m. to 8.15 p.m. In quoting the time of day at which an exercised is to take place, the Diario uses the regular style for the morning hours, but says, "before" or "after the <a href="../cathen/01486b.htm">Angelus</a>", for the afternoon. The Diario notes the phases of the moon, the eclipses, the movable feasts, the <a href="../cathen/05399b.htm">ember days</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> cycles, the time for the solemnization of marriage, a list of days on which certain specially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> images of the Blessed Virgin are exposed for veneration, and a list of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and blessed <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> on each day of the year and of the churches at which the feast is celebrated. In the body of the work the statement is frequently made that images and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, ordinarily veiled, are uncovered and put in a prominent place. Such <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are: the table on which Christ instituted the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>; the manger or crib in which Christ is said to have been placed after his birth; the heads of Sts. Peter and Paul; the Chair of St. Peter (<em>Cathedra Petri</em>). Next are given the various functions as follows: --
<h2 id="section1">Ordinary</h2>
<h3 id="A">Daily</h3>

<p>In all churches where canons or <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities reside the canonical Hours of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> are recited and conventual Mass is sung. Mass is said in all the churches, the earliest at 5 o'clock, and the latest at 12, the latter at S. Maria della Pace and always a votive Mass in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> in thanksgiving for the favours conferred by the Blessed Virgin. At S. Giuseppe alla Lungara dei Pii Operai a daily foundation Mass with sermon and "Libera" is offered for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. The Exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> takes place daily at S. Gioacchino ai Monti, at S. Claudia dei Borgognoni, at S. Croce of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of S. Maria Riparatrice, at S. Brigida, at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of Corpus Domini, in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Daughters of the Sacred Heart. In these <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> special devotions are held during the day and are always well attended. The recitation of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> is a favourite practice of the Romans; it takes place at Mass in twenty-one churches in which Benediction is then given with the <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a>; in the afternoon the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, or, in some instances, the beads of the Seven Dolours or of the Precious Blood, is said daily in thirty-seven <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, in some of which a sermon is added. On feast days Exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is held in the morning in six churches, <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> and Benediction in the afternoon in eight; in five also sermon is preached, and in five others the chaplet of the Sacred Heart is added.
<h3 id="B">Weekly</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches high Mass and sermon are held at eight or nine o'clock on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, and in the afternoon <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> is taught. At St. John Lateran there is a procession before Mass; at S. Gioacchino the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is exposed at Mass and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of reparation are said, in the afternoon Benediction is given after the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> has been recited before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. In nine other churches there is Exposition in the morning, to which, at S. Prassede, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for a good death are added. Benediction is given in many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> at various times of the day together with an explanation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, an instruction, a sermon, <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, etc. The Way of the Cross is made in four churches. The Diario notes the following devotions to be held for Monday: Exposition during Mass at Santi XII Apostoli and Ara Coeli, in the evening at four churches, with special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to St. Jude Thaddeus at S.

On the Saturday before <a href="../cathen/13747a.htm">Sexagesima</a> some churches perform a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exercise called <em>Carnivale santificato</em>. On the Friday after <a href="../cathen/13747a.htm">Sexagesima</a> and on the Fridays of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, in nearly all churches, the Way of the Cross is made or the Via Dolorosa. <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons are preached on Wednesday and Fridays. The <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> preaches are received in audience by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. For the Apostolic Palace a special preacher is appointed. On L&aelig;tare Sunday the holy Father <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the <a href="../cathen/06629a.htm">golden Rose</a>, which he then sends to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of rank, to cities, or corporations as a token of gratitude; on this Sunday also begin the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instructions prescribed by Benedict XIV as a preparation for <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> exercises are performed in all the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, and additional devotions are held in many, as the washing of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> altar at St. Peter's on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, sermons on the Passion, Way of the Cross or of the Desolata, or honouring the Hours of the Agony. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Rite is used for the functions of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> at SS. Sergio e Bacco, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Rite at S. Nicola da Tolentino on 1 January. At S. Andrea della Valle the Veni Creator is sung after Mass and the <a href="../cathen/02275a.htm">baptismal vows</a> are renewed; at S. Maria in Campitelli the faithful <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> themselves to the patron chosen for the year; at S. Carlo a Catinari the spiritual testament of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> is read on 5 January. At S. Atanasio water is blessed in the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek rite</a> and S. Andrea della Valle and at other churches in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. This water the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> faithful take home to sprinkle the sick, their houses, fields, vineyards, and themselves. The 6th of January is the titular feast of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>; Mass is celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a>, and sermons are preached in the different languages. On 3 February takes place the blessing of throats with a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of St. Blaise, and in the churches of the Blessed Virgin the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> custom obtains, throughout the year, of anointing the throats with blessed oil. On 31 December, in nearly all the churches and <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, the year is closed with Exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a>. Formerly greater solemnity was imparted to some feasts by the presence of the Holy Father, who would celebrate the Mass or <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, or would assist at them pontifically in one of the greater <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> and impart the <a href="../cathen/02602a.htm">Apostolic blessing</a> to the world from the outer loggia. The Diario mentions some twenty days on which such <em>a cappella papale</em>, as it was called, used to take place before 1870. For the year 1908 only two are noted: for 20 July, the anniversary of the death of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, and for 9 August, the anniversary of the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of the reigning pontiff [1908], <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>.

<p>The special feasts of the churches are ushered in by preparatory triduums, novenas, or devotions of seven or of eight days, on which <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exercises are performed in common and Benediction is given; entire months are dedicated to <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or mysteries &#151; as the month of St. Joseph, the month of Mary, of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, of the Precious Blood, of the Sacred Heart of Mary, of the Seven Dolours, of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> and of the Dead. Holy communion for a series of fixed days of the week, together with special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, is much in use. We read in the Diario of six <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> of St. Aloysius, seven of St. Camillus, nine of St. Cajetan, ten of St. Ignatius, fifteen of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>; nine Mondays of the <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Archangel St. Gabriel</a>; nine Tuesdays of St. Anne, and thirteen of <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a>; seven Wednesdays of Our Lady of Mount Carmel; seven Fridays of the Seven Dolours; seven of <a href="../cathen/08556a.htm">St. Juliana Falconieri</a>, nine of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, ten of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, thirteen of St. Francis of Paul, thirteen of St. Onuphrius; five Saturdays of the Name of Mary, twelve of the Immaculate conception, fifteen of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Holy Rosary</a>.

<p>To encourage the faithful in the frequent reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, in visiting the churches, venerating the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> or the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and in performing other acts of devotion, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has opened wide her treasure and granted almost innumerable <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>. Of special note is the <em>toties quoties</em> <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a> has this <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> for every day of the year; the church of S. Andrea delle Fratte on the feast of St. Francis of Paul (3 May); the churches of the Trinitarians on <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a>; SS. Cuore at the Castro Pretorio on the feast of the Sacred Heart; the churches of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> on 16 July; in several churches the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> of Portiuncula on 2 August; the churches of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> on the feast of the Seven Dolours in September; where the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Confraternity of the Rosary</a> is canonically established, on <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> Sunday; in several churches on the feast of the Holy Redeemer; in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> churches on 2 November. Only lately (20 February, 1908) the Holy Father has granted a <em>toties quoties</em> <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> practice of the <a href="../cathen/13505a.htm">Scala Santa</a> (<a href="../cathen/01111c.htm">Acta S. Sedis</a>, XLI, 294). Spiritual retreats are given for men twice a year at the Caravita, and once for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; for both sexes at the Crociferi, and a special one preparatory to <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, for both sexes, at SS. Vincenzo e Anastasio.
