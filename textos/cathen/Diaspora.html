<h1>Diaspora</h1>  

<p>(Or DISPERSION).

<p><em>Diaspora</em> was the name given to the countries (outside of Palestine) through which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were dispersed, and secondarily to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> living in those countries. The Greek term, <em>diaspora</em>, corresponds to the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> meaning "exile" (cf. <a href="../bible/jer024.htm#vrs5">Jeremiah 24:5</a>). It occurs in the Greek version of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, e.g. <a href="../bible/deu028.htm#vrs25">Deuteronomy 28:25</a> and <a href="../bible/deu030.htm#vrs4">30:4</a>, where the dispersion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> among the nations is foretold as the punishment of their apostasy. In <a href="../bible/joh007.htm">John 7:35</a>, the word is used implying disdain: "The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go unto the dispersed among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>?" Two of the <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a>, viz. that of James and I Peter, are addressed to the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> of the Diaspora. In <a href="../bible/act002.htm">Acts 2</a> are enumerated the principal countries from which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> came who heard the Apostles preach at Pentecost, everyone "in his own tongue". The Diaspora was the result of the various deportations of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> which invariably followed the invasion or conquest of Palestine. The first deportation took place after the capture of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> by Shalmaneser (Salmanasar) and Sargon, when a portion of the Ten Tribes were carried into the regions of the Euphrates and into <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a>, 721 B.C. (<a href="../bible/2ki017.htm">2 Kings 17</a>). In 587 B.C. the Kingdom of Juda was transported into Mesopotamia. When, about fifty years later, Cyrus allowed the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to return to their country, only the poorer and more fervent availed themselves of the permission The richer <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> remained in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> forming the beginning of a numerous and influential community. The conquests of Alexander the Great caused the spreading of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> throughout <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Seleucus Nicator made the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> citizens in the cities he built in his dominions, and gave them equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> with the Greeks and Macedonians. (Josephus, Antiquities, XII, iii, l.) Shortly after the transportation of Juda into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> a number of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who had been left in Palestine <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. (<a href="../bible/jer042.htm">Jeremiah 42</a>-<a href="../bible/jer044.htm">44</a>) They formed the nucleus of the famous Alexandrine colony. But the great transportation into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was effected by Ptolemy Soter. "And Ptolemy took many captives both from the mountainous parts of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and from the places about <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and Samaria and led them into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and settled them there" (Antiquities, XII, I, 1). In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> there was already a community of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at the time of Caesar. It is mentioned in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of Caesar cited by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Ant., XLV, x, 8). After the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by Titus thousands of Jewish slaves were placed upon the market. They formed the nucleus of settlements in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and Gaul. At the time of the Apostles the number of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the Diaspora was exceedingly great. The Jewish author of the Sibylline Oracles (2nd century B.C.) could already say of his countrymen: "Every land and every sea is full of them" (Or. Sib., III, 271). <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> mentioning the riches of the temple says: "Let no one wonder that there was so much wealth in our temple since all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> throughout the habitable earth sent their contributions" (Ant., XIV, vii, 2). The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the Diaspora paid a temple tax, a kind of <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's-pence</a>; a didrachma being required from every male adult. The sums transmitted to Jerusalem were at times so large as to cause an inconvenient drainage of gold, which more than once induced the Roman government either to stop the transmittance or even to confiscate it.

<p>Though the Diaspora <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were, on the whole, faithful to their religion, there was a noticeable difference of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinion between the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> and Alexandrine <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>. In Mesopotamia the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> read and studied the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in Hebrew. This was comparatively easy to them since Chaldee, their vernacular, was kindred to the Hebrew. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, commonly called Hellenistic <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, soon forgot Hebrew. A Greek version of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, was made for them. The consequence was that they were less ardent in the punctilious observance of their Law. Like the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> they showed a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> tendency by erecting a rival temple to that in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. It was built by the son of Onias the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> in Leontopolis in Lower <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> during the reign of Ptolemy Philometor, 160 B.C., and was destroyed 70 B.C. (Ant., XIII, iii, <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. 2, 3). It is a curious fact that whereas Hellenistic <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> became the soil in which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> took root and waxed strong, the colony in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> remained a stronghold of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and produced its famous Talmud. The deeply-rooted antagonism between the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks made the amalgamation of the two races impossible. Though some of the <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucids</a> and Ptolemies, such as Seleucus Nicator and Antiochus the Great, were favourable towards the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, there was constant friction between the two elements in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Occasional pillage and massacre were the inevitable result. Thus on one occasion the Greeks in Seleucia and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> massacred some 50,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (Ant., XVIII, ix, 9). On another occasion the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, getting the upper hand in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, killed the Greek inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a> and were in consequence banished from the island (Dio Cassius, LXVIII, 23). In Alexandria it was found <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to confine the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to a separate quarter, or ghetto. The Roman Empire was on the whole well-disposed towards the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the Diaspora. They had everywhere the right of residence and could not be expelled. The two exceptions were the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> (Ant., XVIII, iii, 5) and under Claudius (<a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs2">Acts 18:2</a>). But both these instances were of short duration. Their cult was declared a religio licita. All communities had their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, <em>proseuchai</em> or <em>sabbateia</em>, which served also as <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> and places of assembly. The most famous was that in Antioch (De bell. Jud., VII, iii 3). They had their cemeteries; in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, they buried their dead in <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. They were allowed freely to observe their <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbaths</a>, festivals, and dietary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. They were exempt from the emperor-worship and from military service. Many <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> enjoyed Roman citizenship, e.g. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs37">Acts 16:37-39</a>). In many places the Jewish community formed a recognized organization with administrative, judicial, and financial powers. It was ruled by a council called <em>gerousia</em>, composed of elders, <em>presbyteroi</em>, at the head of which was the archon. Another token of the freedom which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> enjoyed throughout the empire was their active propagandism (cf. <a href="../bible/mat023.htm#vrs15">Matthew 23:15</a>). The <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> were called <em>phoboumenoi</em> or <em>sebomenoi</em>, i.e. God-fearing (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs16">Acts 13:16, 26, 43</a>; Antiquities, XIV, 7:2). Their number appears to have been very great. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> met them in almost all the cities he visited. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, praising the excellence of the Law, says: "the multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> itself has had a great inclination to follow our religious observances. There is not a city of the Grecians or Sabarians, where our customs and the prohibition as to our food are not observed" etc. (Contra Apion., II, xl). Many of the converts were distinguished <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, e.g. Aguila, the chamberlain of the Queen of Candace (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs26">Acts 8:26 sq.</a>); Azizus, King of <a href="../cathen/05402a.htm">Emesa</a>, and Polemo, King of Cilicia (Ant., xx, vii); the patrician lady Fulvia (Ant., XVIII, iii, 5).
