<h1>Diego Hurtade de Mendoza</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> diplomat and writer, and one of the greatest figures in the history of Spanish politics and letters; born in <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parentage</a>, about 1503; died in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1575. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> under private tutors and later at the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>. A powerful <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, he was a man who carried to a successful termination whatever he undertook. He was destined originally for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and acquired much <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> suited to further his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> advancement, both at home, where he learned to speak Arabic fluently, and at Salamanca, where he studied Latin, Greek, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, civil and canon law. But he preferred politics and literature, and attracted the notice of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, who sent him in 1530 as ambassador to the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a>. In 1543 the emperor sent him as one of his representatives to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, where he successfully sustained the imperial interests. While at the Council he was appointed in 1547 special ambassador to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and captain-general of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, whence he returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1554.

<p>As a poet Mendoza excelled in both the older Spanish and the new Italian measures, but his specimens of the latter show more richness of thought, and he probably exercised considerable influence in popularizing and securing the triumph of the Italian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of lyric poetry in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In his "Guerra de Granada", published in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1627, he shows himself a master of prose. It was written during his exile at <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> (1568-1571), whither he had been sent by <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II</a> after some trouble with a noble at court, and is a masterly piece of Spanish prose writing. His "Lazarillode Tormes" is a work of genius. He is said to have written it while he was at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> or soon after leaving it. It is the autobiography of a boy born on the banks of the Tormes near Salamanca, and its object is to satirize all classes of Spanish <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. It is written in rich idiomatic Spanish, and after 1553, when it first appeared, it went through many editions, both in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and abroad. Like other books that enjoy great popularity, it led to many imitations.

<p>Just before his death he presented to Philip II for the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> his valuable collection of books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> including the Arabic ones he had found in <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, and they remain there to this day. La Biblioteca de Autores Espa&ntilde;oles (Madrid, 1848-86) publishes his "Lazarillo" in the third volume, his poems in the thirty-second, and selected works in the twenty-first and thirty-sixth volumes.
