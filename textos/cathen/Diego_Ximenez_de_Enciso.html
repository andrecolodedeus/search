<h1>Diego Ximenez de Enciso</h1>  

<p>Dramatic poet, b. in <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, c. 1585; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of death unknown. All trace of him is lost after 1632. He was much admired and praised by <a href="../cathen/03545a.htm">Cervantes</a>, <a href="../cathen/09354b.htm">Lope de Vega</a> and Montalv&aacute;n; the last considers him a "model for those who wish to write great comedies". Although he enjoyed some fame, as his frequent mention by his contemporaries would show, he has shared the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of many other Spanish dramatists of his day, and his works have undeservedly been consigned to oblivion. In his catalogue of the Spanish <a href="../cathen/14559a.htm">theatre</a>, Cayetano Barrera gives a list of eleven plays by Enciso, but most of them are scattered throughout the great <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and only three have reached several editions, namely, "El Pr&iacute;ncipe Don C&aacute;rlos", "La Mayor Haza&ntilde;a del Emperador C&aacute;rlos Quinto", and "Los M&eacute;dicis de Florencia". To the average reader, however, only the last named is easily accessible. It is to be found in "La Biblioteca de Autores Espa&ntilde;oles". These three plays were probably chosen for repeated editions because they show Enciso at his best. Enciso's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the historical drama is thoroughly unique for a Spanish dramatist, for he alone of all his contemporaries seems to regard the historical drama as being capable of adhering closely to facts. He does not, however, adhere slavishly to history, but rather uses it as did <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a>, that is, he uses recognized sources in such a way as to give to his plot the appearance of probability. In his versification Enciso shows great variety, but the eleven-syllabled verse seems to predominate. His work as a whole is characterized by the elevated tone which pervades it, the simplicity and interest of the plots, and its sonorous language.
