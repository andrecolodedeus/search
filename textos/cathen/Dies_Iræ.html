<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Dies Ir&aelig;</h1>  

<p>This name by which the sequence in requiem Masses is commonly known. They are the opening words of the first verse: <em>Dies ir&aelig;, dies illa</em>. The <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> af the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> prescribe the recitation of the sequence by the celebrant on the following occasions: (1) in the Mass of <a href="../cathen/01315b.htm">All Souls' Day</a> (<em>In commemoratione Omnium Fidelium Defunctorum</em>); (2) in funeral Masses (<em>In die obitus seu depositionis defuncti</em>);and (3) whensoever in requiem Masses, only one <em>oratio</em>, or collect, is to be said, namely in the anniversary Mass, and when Mass is solemnly celebrated on the third, the seventh, or the thirtieth (month's mind) day after death or burial. Its recitation in other requiem Masses (<em>In Missis quotidianis defunctorum</em>) is optional with the celebrant. It should be noted here that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Congregation of Sacred Rites (12 August, 1854) permitting the choir to omit such stanzas as do not contain a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not included in the new edition of the "Decreta Authentica S. R. C" (Rome, 1898-1900). From this fact may be inferred that the more ancient rule is now in force and that the whole sequence must either be sung by the choir or be "recited" in a high and clear voice with <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> accompaniment (cf. American Ecclesiastical Review, August, 1907, p. 201).

<p>As found in the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, the Dies Ir&aelig; is a Latin poem of fifty-seven lines in accentual (non-quantitative), rhymed, trochaic metre. It comprises nineteen stanza, of which the first seventeen follow the type of the first stanza: <blockquote> 1. Dies ir&aelig;, dies illa, <br>Solvet s&aelig;clum in favilla: <br>Teste David cum Sibyll&acirc;. </blockquote>

<p>The remaining stanzas discard the scheme of triple rhymes in favour of rhymed couplets, while the last two lines use assonance instead of rhyme and are, moreover, catalectic: <blockquote> 18. Lacrimosa dies illa, <br>Qu&acirc; resurget ex favillft, <br>Judicandus homo reus.

<p>19. Huic ergo parce Deus: <br>Pie Jesu Domine, <br>Dona eis requiem. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </blockquote>

<p>Thus the last two stanzas are printed in the typical 1900) edition of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> edition of the <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plain-chant</a> setting. The Vatican edition (1907) of the <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plain-chant</a> melody however, apparently takes account of the fact that the last six lines did not, in all probability, originally belong to the sequence, and divides them into three couplets.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> text of the sequence is found, with light verbal variations, in a thirteenth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the Biblioteca. Nazionale at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (cf. Haberl, Magister Choralis, Ratisbon, 1900, pp. 237-238). Father Eusebius Clop, O.F.M., in the "Revue du chant Gr&eacute;gorien" (November-December, 1907, p. 49) argues a date between 1253-1255 for the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>--a. <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> whose calendar does not contain the name of <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1255, and whose name would have been inserted if the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> were later date. The same writer would assign (pp. 48, 49) a still earlier date (1250) to a copy of the Dies Ir&aelig; inserted at the end of a so-called "Breviary of St. Clare" dating about 1228. Into his arguments it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to enter here; but it is important to notice that these dates are much anterior to the dates of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which, until recently, <a href="../cathen/07596a.htm">hymnologists</a> had cognizance of when they attempted to fix the probable authorship of the sequence. Thus <a href="../cathen/10478b.htm">Mone</a> found none anterior to the fifteenth century; Chevalier mentions only a Magdeburg <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> of 1480 and a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> of 1477; the first edition of Julian's "Dictionary of Hymnology" (1892) declared the "oldest form known to the present time" to be found in a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> "written at the end of the fourteenth century and apparently for use at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>"; Warren, in his "Dies Irae" (London, 1902, p. 5), knows no earlier <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> The second edition of Julian (1907) mentions the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in its supplement (p. 1629), but not the "Breviary of St. Clare". Father Clop describes also a third contemporary <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (p. 49), Italian, like the others: "Toutes trois enfin appartenant &eacute;galement &agrave; la liturgie des Fr&egrave;res Mineurs". All this renders very probable the conjecture generally entertained by hymnologists, that the Dies Ir&aelig; was composed by a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> in the thirteenth century.

<p>Its authorship has been most generally ascribed to <a href="../cathen/14694a.htm">Thomas of Celano</a>, the friend, fellow-friar, and biographer of St. Francis. Reasons for this particularity of ascription are given by Keyser (Beitr&auml;ge zur Geschichte und Erkl&auml;rung der alten Kirchenhymnen, Paderborn und M&uuml;nster, 1886, II, 194-196 and 230-235); also by Duffield (Latin Hymn Writers and Their Hymns, New York, 1889, 245-247), an ardent champion of the ascription to Thomas; also in "The Dolphin" (Nov., 1904, 514-516) which corrects a fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in one of Duffield's main arguments. Ten other names have been suggested by various writers as the probable author of the Dies Ir&aelig;: (1) <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (d. 604); (2) <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a> (d. 1153); (3) <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> (d. 1274); (4) Cardinal Matthew d'Acquasparta (d. 1302); (5) <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (d. 1216) (6) Thurstan, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a> (d. 1140); (7) Cardinal Latino Orsini, or Frangipani, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> (d. 1296); (8) Humbert, a general of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> (d. 1277); (9) Agostino <a href="../cathen/02559b.htm">Biella</a>, an Augustinian (d. 1491); (10) Felix Haemmerlein, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> (d. 1457). The ascription to Haemmerlein was due to the discovery, after his death, of a variant text of the sequence among his papers. Its eighteenth and nineteenth stanzas are: <blockquote> 18. Latcrimosa dies illa, <br>Cum resurget ex favill&acirc; <br>Tamquam ignis ex scintill&acirc;,

<p>19. Judicandus homo reus: <br>Huic ergo parce, Deus; <br>Esto semper adjutor meus. </blockquote>

<p>To these are added five stanzas of the same form. This Haemmerlein text is given by Keyser (op. cit., 211), Warren (op. cit., 11), and by others. Still another text, known as the "Mantuan Marble" text (first printed in 1594), prefaces the Dies Ir&aelig; with four similar stanzas, and replaces stanzas 17-19 with the single stanza: <blockquote> Ut consors beatitatis <br>Vivam cum justificatis <br>In &aelig;vum &aelig;ternitatis. </blockquote>

<p>Daniel gives both texts in his "Thesaurus Hymnologicus'' (II, 103-106), except the two concluding stanzas of the Haemmerlein text. Coles (Dies Irae in Thirteen Original Versions, New York, 1868) gives (xv-xxi) both texts together with versified English translation.

<p>All of these additional stanzas rather detract from the vigorous beauty of the original <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, whose oldest known form is, with slight verbal changes, that which is found in the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. It appears most likely that this text originally ended with the seventeenth stanza, the first four of the concluding six lines having been found among a series of verses on the <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a> "Libera me, Domine" in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the end of the twelfth or the beginning of the thirteenth century (cf. <a href="../cathen/10478b.htm">Mone</a>, Lateinische Hymnen des Mittelalters, Freiburg im Br., 1863, I, 406). It is quite probable that the sequence was first intended for private devotion and that subsequently the six lines were added to it in order to adapt it to <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use. The composer found his Biblical text in Soph. (i. 15, 16): "Dies ir&aelig; dies illa. . . dies tub&aelig; et clangoris"; and it may be that he obtained a suggestion for his wonderful rhythm (cf. Trench, Sacred Latin Poetry, 3rd ed., London, 1874, p, 302, foot-note) from a tenth-century judgment <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> (given in two forms by Dreves, Analecta Hymnica, Leipzig, 1896, XXIII, pp. 53, 54) containing this rhythmized text of Sophonias: <blockquote> Dies ir&aelig;, dies illa, <br>Dies nebul&aelig; et turbinis, <br>Dies tub&aelig; et clangoris, <br>Dies nebulosa, valde, <br>Quando tenebrarum pondus <br>Cadet super peccatores. </blockquote>

<p>The sequence has been translated many times in various tongues, the largest recorded number (234) being English renderings. Among the names of those who have given complete or fragmentary translations are those of <a href="../cathen/04467a.htm">Crashaw</a> (1646); <a href="../cathen/05167b.htm">Dryden</a> (1696); Scott (1805); Macaulay (1819); <a href="../cathen/03417a.htm">Father Caswall</a> (1849). Amongst American translators we find Dr. Abraham Coles, a physician of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, credited with eighteen versions; W. W. Nevin, with nine; and Rev. Dr. Samuel W. Duffield, with six. Space will not permit here an analysis of the Dies Ir&aelig; or any quotation of the wealth of eulogy passed upon it by <a href="../cathen/07596a.htm">hymnologists</a> of every shade of religious conviction, save fragment from the appreciations of Daniel: "Sacr&aelig; poeseos summum decus et Ecclesi&aelig; Latin&aelig; keimelion est pretiosissimum" (It is the chief glory of sacred poetry and the most precious treasure of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>) ; of Orby Shipley, in the "Dublin Review" of Jan., 1883, who, after enumerating some <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> "which are only not inspired, or which, more truly, are in their degree inspired", says: "But beyond them all, and before them all, and above them all may, perhaps be placed Dies irae, by <a href="../cathen/14694a.htm">Thomas of Celano</a>"; of Coles: "Among gems it is the diamond. It is solitary in its excellence"; of Dr. Schaff: "This marvellous <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is the acknowledged masterpiece of Latin poetry and the most sublime of all uninspired <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>"; of Dr. Neale: ". . . the Dies ir&aelig; in its unapproached glory".
