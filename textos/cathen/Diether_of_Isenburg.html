<h1>Diether of Isenburg</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, b. about 1412; d. 7 May, 1482, at Aschaffenburg. He studied at the University of Erfurt, of which he became Rector in 1434. At the age of sixteen he was already canon at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and, somewhat later, held <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of Cologne and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. In 1442 he became <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> in the collegiate churches of St. Victor and St. John in <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and in 1453 <a href="../cathen/04577a.htm">custos</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter in the same city. In 1456, Diether aspired to the vacant <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">See of Trier</a>, probably attempting to gain votes through <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>; but the majority of the voters decided in favor of John of Baden. But after the death of Dietrich of Erbach, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (d. 6 May, 1459), Diether's ambitious aspirations were realized. Probably through <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> he was elected to this see on 18 June, 1459, and entered upon his office without awaiting the approval either of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or emperor. <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a> was then holding a congress at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> with the object of influencing the princes of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to undertake a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and was greatly disappointed at the small number of princes that appeared at the congress. Upon hearing that Diether did not intend to come to <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, but had sent envoys to obtain the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation, he sent word to him that, if he desired the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of confirmation and the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, he would have to come to Mantua in person. By pleading sickness and lack of funds, Diether finally prevailed upon <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> to send the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of confirmation and the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, but only after promising under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to appear personally before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court within a year and to pay the annates, which amounted to 20,550 Rhenish florins. When Diether kept neither of these promises, the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> punished him with minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Angered at this act, he convened a diet at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> in February, 1461, at which he made a formal appeal to a future general council, despite the fact that <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exsecrabilis" (18 Jan., 1460) had condemned such appeals as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. When all the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to bring about an amicable settlement were frustrated by the rebellious <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and deposed Diether in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 21 August, 1461, and appointed Adolf of Nassau in his place. Diether tried to retain his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by arms but was compelled to yield to the superior forces of Adolph of Nassau in October, 1463. After submitting to the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and apologizing to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> plenipotentiary, Pietro Ferrici, he was absolved from the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Upon the death of Adolf of Nassau, on 6 Sept., 1475, Diether was again elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and received both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and imperial <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. His past misfortune had made him a better man. He enforced strict <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, watched carefully over the integrity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and worked strenuously for the advancement of commerce and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. At the northern end of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> he erected the Martinsburg as an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> residence, and in 1477 founded the University of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, which continued to exist until 1798.
