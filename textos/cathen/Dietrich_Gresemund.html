<h1>Dietrich Gresemund</h1>  

<p>German <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>; b. in 1477, at <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>; d. 1512, at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. His father, also named Dietrich, was a native of Meschede in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> first at Erfurt, where he became <em>magister</em>, and subsequently in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Having graduated in medicine at <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, he became court-physician and councillor to the Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, in which city young Dietrich grew up and attracted great attention at an early age by his learning and ability. As early as 1493 he became associated with Wimpfeling, Werner von Themar, and <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Abbot Trithemius</a>, and in 1494 he published his first work. Even at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Trithemius</a> admitted him to his "Catalogus illustrium viroum" with warm eulogies, on the ground that the youth had far surpassed many men of mature age, including even <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>. Having received a thorough classical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and attended lectures in dialectics at the University of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Dietrich studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at Padua in 1495, and at Bologna in 1497. In 1498 he received the degree of <em>doctor legum</em> at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and in 1499 he matriculated at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a>. About 1501 he was in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to study antiquities, but soon had enough of the city, and wrote two very caustic epigrams upon <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> a succession of honours awaited him during the brief remnant of life that was allotted to him. In 1505 he became canon at St. Stephen's, in 1506 <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, in 1508 prothonotary and <em>judex generalis</em>, in 1509 <em>diffinitor cleri minoris</em> at St. Stephen's, and in 1510 <em>scholasticus</em> in the same chapter. He was a sound and an upright judge, and led a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, irreproachable life. He continued to apply himself to <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> studies, cultivated as extensively friendly and literary intercourse, and was associated with the most renowned scholars of his day.

<p>His first work was called "Lucubratiuncul&aelig;" (1494) and dedicated to <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Trithemius</a>. The book is divided into three parts. The first of these, a dialogue in which is discussed the value of the seven liberal arts, met with special applause and was reprinted several times. It is worth remarking that this book contains the first plea from the Rhenish country for a reform in the teaching of grammar. His dialogue on the carnival deals with a humorous subject (1495) at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, he delivered a discourse at a synod presided in the light of a stern censor of the moral life of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. His longest poem &#151; a work of little merit &#151; tells in moralizing, didactic fashion the story of the mutilation of a crucifix by an actor ("Historia violate crucis", written about 1505, but not printed until 1512). Gresemund's hobby was the collection of ancient <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> and inscriptions. In 1510 he issued an edition of short texts in Roman archaeology. Death prevented the publication of his works on antiquities, and the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> had been lost. Individual poems were written for the publications of his friends. He died of hernia in the prime of life. <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> paid him a splendid tribute in his edition of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> in 1516, and Gebwiler describes him in the following words: "Dietrich was slender of body and of medium height, with well-moulded features, dark hair, grey eyes, even-tempered, without rancour, without presumption, without <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, without affectation, gentle in his manner, and truthful".
