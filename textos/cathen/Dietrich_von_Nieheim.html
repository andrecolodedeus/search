<h1>Dietrich von Nieheim</h1>  

<p>(N<font size=-2>IEM</font>).

<p>Born in the <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Diocese of Paderborn</a>, between 1338 and 1340; d. at Maastricht, 22 March, 1418, a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> German historian, best known for his contributions to the history of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>. He took his surname from the little town of Nieheim (in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> district of <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>). Nothing is known about his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and but little about his life previous to his entry into the service of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. He spent some time in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the study of law, but never obtained the degree of Doctor. Under <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> (1362-70) he came to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and obtained in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery the office of notary (<em>notarius s. palati</em>), to keep which he had to take orders, if he had not already taken them. When <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1377) Dietrich accompanied him. <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> conferred on him the lucrative and important office of <em>abbreviator et scriptor</em> in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery (see <a href="../cathen/01028a.htm">ABBREVIATORS</a>); this post he retained under succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Verden (July, 1395), but he never obtained possession of this German <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>; probably, as Eubel suggests (Hierarchia catholica medii &aelig;vi, I, 553), because Dietrich did not expedite with due promptness the documents of his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>. In August, 1399, another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Verden was nominated, Konrad von Soltau; Dietrich remained as before a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> abbreviator. In his writings Dietrich is silent about this Verden incident; in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the archives of St. Peter at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Dr. G&ouml;ller has discovered twenty-six letters of the years 1398-99 which refer to Dietrich; when published they will probably cast more light on this period of his life (cf. R&ouml;mische Quartalschrift, 1905, 82-83). About <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1401, Dietrich was at Erfurt in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where he matriculated at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; in 1403 we find him again active at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as abbreviator. Towards the end of the fourteenth century Johann Peters of Dordrecht had founded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for German <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, known as <a href="../cathen/01514b.htm">Santa Maria dell' Anima</a>, still in existence and united with the German national church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Dietrich was an energetic promoter of the new foundation, to such an extent that after Peters he deserves to be considered its chief founder.

<p>Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>, began in 1378, was still dividing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world. As a member of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, Dietrich was thoroughly informed concerning the origin and development of this unhappy division, and was very active in an effort to close the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Dissatisfied with the proceedings of the two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> (1406-15) at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (1394-1417) at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, he adhered to the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> convoked (1408) by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. He took no part in the council itself, being then in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but he worked for the party of the council, recognized as legitimate the Pisan <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> (1409-160, also his successor, <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> (1410-15), and entered their service. During these years his pen was ever active in the interest of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity. He is certainly the author of the work known as "Nemus Unionis", in which he describes the various ways (<em>vi&aelig;</em>) for putting an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and gives important letters and acts (the work was finished 25 July, 1408; ed. Schard, Basle, 1566). He also wrote "Die scismate libri tres", his most important work, finished in May, 1410 (ed. Erler, Leipzig, 1890), in which he delineates the origin and the history of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> up to the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>; the abundance of its materials makes this work one of the most important authorities for the last stages of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. His judgments, however, concerning <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and facts must be taken with caution, Dietrich being strongly partisan. To <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> himself he addressed (perhaps in 1410) a letter about the proper administration of his office ("Epistola ad dominum Johannem XXIII transmissa de bono Romani pontificis regimine", ed. Rattinger, in "Historisches Jahrbuch", 1884, 163-78). This was preceded by a letter of admonition to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who were to elect <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> ("Informatio facta cardinalibus in conclavi ante electionem Pap&aelig; Johannis XXIII moderni", written in 1410; ed. Erler, "Dietrich von Nieheim", Documents, XXX-XLI). Of other works ascribed to him mention shall be made later.

<p>Towards the end of 1414 was opened the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, destined, if not to remedy all the evils of the time, at least to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. From March, 1415, Dietrich was present at <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and exerted his best efforts for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity. He was dissatisfied with the attitude of <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, and when the latter fled from <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> (20 March, 1415), Dietrich renounced him. Later, in continuation of his aforesaid work on the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, Dietrich wrote a history of <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> to June, 1416 ("Historia de Vit&#226; Johannis XXIII", first printed at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 1620). This work is at the same time a history of the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> to the middle of 1416; it is to be noted, however, that the author's judgment is seriously affected by his passionate opposition to <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>. Another violent lampoon against this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the "Invectiva in diffugientem e Constantiensi concilio Johannem XXIII" (ed. von der Hardt, "Const. Conc.", III, XIV, 296-330) is attributed to Dietrich; it is not certain, however, that he is the author of this fierce pamphlet; Finke rejects quite positively the authorship of Dietrich (R&ouml;mische Quartalschrift f&uuml;r christl. Altertumskunde und f&uuml;r Kirchengesch., 1887, 48 sqq.). During the council Dietrich kept a diary, as he himself mentions in his "Vita Johannis XXIII"; some fragments of it, according to Finke, are still recognizable (op. cit., 1887, 46-58).

<p>Any final judgment on the attitude and influence of Dietrich at <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> must depend on the authorship of three publications often attributed to him, and dealing particularly with the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and the efforts at reunion. These are: (1) "De necessitate reformationis Ecclesi&aelig; in capite et in membris"; also entitled "Avisamenta pulcherrima de unione et reformatione membrorum et capitis fienda" (written 1414; ed. von der Hardt, in "Constant. Concil.", I, VII, 277-309; the latter part of it ed. by Finke in "Forschungen zur Geschichte der Konstanzer Konzils", <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1890, 267-268); (2) "De modis uniendi ac reformandi ecclesiam in concilio universali" (written 1410, ed. von der Hardt, op. cit., I, V, 68-142); (3) "De difficultate reformationis Ecclesi&aelig; in concilio universali" (written August, 1410; ed. von der Hardt, op. cit., I, VI, 255-69). Von der Hardt attributed the treatise "De modis uniendi" to <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Johannes Gerson</a>, the two others to Pierre d'Ailly, but was of the opinion that perhaps Dietrich von Nieheim might be the author of the "De necessitate reformationis". Schwab has shown (<a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Johannes Gerson</a>, W&uuml;rzburg, 1858) that neither <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> nor d'Ailly can be regarded as the author of these works; he ascribed "De modis uniendi" to the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and professor at Bologna, Andreas of Randuf. The other two treatises, he believed, were composed by Dietrich von Nieheim. S&#228;gm&uuml;ller also saw in the aforesaid Abbot Andreas the author of "De modis uniendi" (Historisches Jahrbuch, 1893, 562- 82). Lenz, however, attributes to Dietrich all three works (see below), and his opinion has been accepted by most later historians; Finke, especially, has confirmed it by numerous arguments. Erler, however, to whom we owe a detailed life of Dietrich (see below), does not admit his authorship of the works in question, while <a href="../cathen/07119a.htm">Haller</a> agrees with him in respect to the treatise "De modis uniendi". Mulder has examined (1907) fully (see below) the attitude of Dietrich towards the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> theories prevalent at the council and the contemporary plans for extinction of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. He concludes that Dietrich certainly wrote the "De necessitate reformationis" but not the other two treatises. In these three works there is developed a detailed programme of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform: all three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> are to be removed and the election of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is to be committed to a special electoral assembly. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> must execute, during the council, the desired reforms in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, and the particular practical measures are specified. Erler, as has been seen, denies Dietrich's authorship of these treatises, and therefore sees in him only a very clever <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> functionary, who had no higher aims than the extinction of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and a reform of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery. Finke on the contrary, accepting the authorship of Dietrich, thinks that with time his views grew broader, and that, in spite of his weakness as an historian, his bold and influential <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms made him eventually one of the most important figures of the early fifteenth century. He calls him the greatest publicist of the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>After the council we find Dietrich at Maastricht, where he possessed a canonicate; there he fell ill, and on 15 March, 1418, made his testament, by which he bequeathed his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> on the German side of the Alps to the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> newly built by him at Hameln, and his Italian possessions to the German <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> dell' Anima at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He died in the same month, probably, as stated above, 22 March. Besides the works already mentioned Dietrich composed several others, among them an historical work entitled "Privilegia aut jura imperii circa investituras episcopatuum et abbatiarum," etc. (ed. Schard, Sylloge de jurisdictione imp., Basle, 1566, 785-859), chiefly an account of the Holy Roman Empire. Of the "Chronicon" composed by him only fragments are extant, discovered and published by Sauerland (Mitteilungen des Instituts f&uuml;r &aelig;sterr. Gesch., 1885, 589-614; also separately at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 1885) and by Mulder (see below). A chronicle of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, part of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a> (Vit&aelig; pontificum Romanorum a Nicolao IV usque ad Urbanum V) formerly ascribed to Dietrich, it is now known, was not written by him. Probably, also, he is not the author of a pamphlet against Cardinal Johannes Dominici ("Epistola Luciferi seu Satan&aelig; ad Johannem Dominici, ord. Pr&aelig;d. presb. card. S. Sixti", ed. in "Nemus unionis"). A geographical work entitled "De regionibus orbis et qualitatibus habitantium in eisdem" written in 1407-1408 is lost. In 1411 he composed a treatise against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>: "Tractatus contra dampnatos Wiclivitas Prag&aelig;" (ed. Erler in "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r vaterl&#228;ndische Gesch. und Altertumskunde", M&uuml;nster, 1885, I, 178-98). For the functionaries of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery he compiled the guide known as "Liber cancellari&aelig; apostolic&aelig;". He also compiled a short guide to the regular praxis of curial administration, "Stilus palatii abbreviatus" (both edited by Erler, "Der Liber cancellari&aelig; apostolic&aelig; vom Jahre 1380 und der Stilus palatii abbreviatus vom Dietrich von Nieheim", Leipzig, 1888).
