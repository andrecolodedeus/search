<p>(D<font size=-2>INIA</font>; D<font size=-2>INIENSIS</font>)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising the entire department of the Basses Alpes; suffragan of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was made to include the two departments of the Hautes and Basses Alpes, in addition to the former Diocese of Digne, the Archdiocese of Embrun, the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/06378a.htm">Gap</a>, Sisteron and Senez, a very considerable part of the Dioceses of Gland&egrave;ves and Riez, and fourteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Archdiocese of Aix</a> and the Diocese of Apt. In 1822 Gap was made an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> and, thus divested of the department of the Hautes Alpes, the present Diocese of Digne covers the territory formerly included in the Dioceses of Digne, Senez, Gland&egrave;ves, Riez, and Sisteron.
<h2>Former Diocese of Digne</h2>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was evangelized by Sts. Domninus and Vincentius who came from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> in the second half of the fourth century with St. Marcellinus, the Apostle of Embrun. It is not certain that they were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Pentadius who attended the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> in 506. Among the incumbents of the See of Digne may be mentioned: Elz&eacute;ar de Villeneuve (1334-41), author of a celebrated form of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to be taken by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; Pierre III de Verceil (1432-39), who represented the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the Count of Provence at the Council of Basle; Guillaume V d'Estoute ville (1439-55), closely connected with the history of the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> and later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>; Antoine* III H&eacute;rouet (1552-68), poet and translator of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>; Forbin Janson (1664-68), afterwards a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and ambassador to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; Miollis (1805-38), whose kindness was proverbial, and who was the original of "Mgr. Myriel" in Victor Hugo's "Les Mis&eacute;rables", and <a href="../cathen/13769a.htm">Sibour</a> (1839-48), who died <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.
<h2>Diocese of Senez</h2>

<p>Marcellus I, the first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Diocese of Senez, attended the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> in 506; nevertheless, Senez must have been an episcopal city as early as 439. Jean IV Soanen, the Oratorian, noted for his opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Senez from 1696 until the time of his deposition in 1727.
<h2>Diocese of Gland&egrave;ves</h2>

<p>Claudius, the first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, ascended the episcopal throne in 541, but Gland&egrave;ves was probably a see as early as 439. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Symphorien Bullioud (1508-20), also ambassador from <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> to <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>; Francis I Faure (1651-53), the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and de Belloy (1752-55), who died a centenarian in 1808, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.
<h2>Diocese of Sisteron</h2>

<p>Johannes, the first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sisteron, appears early in the sixth century. Owing to the ungracious reception accorded Bishop G&eacute;rard by the Chapter of Sisteron, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of that see remained at Forcalquier from 1061 to 1169 and, until the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, the church at Forcalquier bore the title of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Laffittau, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> who was agent of Cardinal Dubois, and also an historian, occupied the See of Sisteron from 1719 to 1764.
<h2>Diocese of Riez</h2>

<p>According to an unsupported tradition, the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is attributed to the first century and to Eusebius of Eudochius, companion of St. Lazarus. A certain St. Prosper of <a href="../cathen/12717a.htm">Reggio</a> in Emilia (at the beginning of the fifth century) figures in the history of Riez and was perhaps its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; however, the first certainly known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is St. Maximus (433-60), who succeeded <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a> as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of L&eacute;rins and who, in 439, held a council at Riez with a view to improving the deplorable condition of the churches of Southern Gaul. His successor, St. Faustus (461-93), also <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of L&eacute;rins, was noted for his writings against <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">Predestinationists</a>; it was to him that Sidonius Apollinaris dedicated his "Carmen Eucharisticum" in gratitude for hospitality received at Riez. Robert Ceneau, the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator (1530-32), afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avranches and <a href="../cathen/02483a.htm">Gui Bentivoglio</a> (1622-25), who was <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and defender of French interests at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and who played an important role under Louis XIII, are also mentioned among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Riez.

<p>The Diocese of Digne numbers the following <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: St. Thyrsus of Sisteron and St. Promatius of Forcalquier, both perhaps of the third century; the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> St. Marius and St. Donatus (fifth, sixth centuries), natives of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, and founders of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> near Forcalquier and Sisteron; St. Mayeul (or Majolus) (910-94), born at Valensole and noted as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny and a friend of Emperor <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>; St. Bevon (tenth century), born at Noyers, helped to deliver Provence from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>; Blessed G&eacute;rard, founder of the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, who died in 1120, his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> being preserved at Manosque; St. John of Matha (1160-1213), born at Faucon and founder of the Trinitarians; Blessed Hugh, a great <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> preacher who was attached to the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/08406c.htm">Joachim of Floris</a> and died in 1255; his sister St. Douceline, who was born at Digne, founded the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines</a> of Hy&egrave;res and died in 1274; <a href="../cathen/05397a.htm">St. Elzear of Sabran</a> who died in 1332, and his wife St. Delphina of Sabran (1284-1360); and the Venerable Jacques Chastan (1803-38), born at Marcoux and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in Korea. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in Digne produced Fran&ccedil;ois de Meyronnes, conspicuous at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> and known as the "enlightened doctor", and <a href="../cathen/06391b.htm">Gassendi</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> who, from 1634 to 1655, was <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Digne, on which he wrote a learned work. The principal places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: Notre Dame des Anges at Lure, frequented annually by over 10,000 of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, a shrine founded in the century by a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> from <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>; Notre Dame de Romigier at Manosque, dating back to the fifth century, Notre Dame du Roc at Castellane, established in the eighth century; and Notre Dame de Beauvoir at Moustiers Ste Marie. This last named shrine was visited in the time of Sidonius Apollinaris. Two rocks overhang the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Our Lady and are held together by an iron chain, from which is suspended a golden star presented by a Knight of Rhodes who, having been taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, invoked Our Lady of Moustiers and was delivered.

<p>Prior to the enforcement of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1905 there were in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, the Missionaries of Ste Garde, the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of Christian Schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Brothers of Christian Instruction of St. Gabriel</a>. Local orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> especially worthy of mention are: the Congregation of Our Lady of the Presentation, a teaching order at Manosque, and that of the Sisters of Christian Doctrine of the Holy Childhood, whose mother house is at Digne, and who devote themselves alike to teaching and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work. In 1899 the following institutions in the diocese were under the care of religious: 12 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for boys and girls, 13 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and hospices, 1 house of retreat and 4 houses for religious nurses. In 1905 (the last year of the Concordatory period) the Diocese of Digne had a population of 115,021, 35 pastorates, 314 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (mission churches), and 13 curacies subventioned by the State.
