<h1>Dijon</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of Dijon comprises the entire department of C&ocirc;te-d'Or and is a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. According to the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> it also included the department of Haute-Marne, which, however, it was called upon to relinquish in 1821, owing to the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Diocese of Langres</a>.

<p>Between the years 506 and 540 it was revealed to St. Gregory, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, and an ancestor of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, that a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the peasants led them to visit contained the remains of <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a>. He had a large basilica erected over it, and soon travellers from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> brought him the acts of this saint's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. These acts are part of a collection of documents according to which <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> was evangelized in the second century by <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and the disciple of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a>, assisted by two <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, Andochius and Thyrsus. The good work is said to have prospered at <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, where it received valuable support from the youthful Symphorianus; at Saulieu where Andochius and Thyrsus had established themselves; at <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a> where the three brothers, Speusippus, Eleusippus, and Meleusippus, were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and finally at Dijon. In the meantime the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> broke out, and <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a> and his companions were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> first raised by Boulliau and <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a> in the seventeenth century concerning the authenticity of these acts seem justified by the conclusions of P&egrave;re Van Hooff and Monseigneur Duchesne, according to which the Acts of <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the three brothers of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, on which the aforesaid traditions are based, are <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> and copied from Cappadocian legends. This controversy, however, does not alter the fact that before the fifth century a saint named Benignus was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Dijon; nor does it dim the splendour of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, as related by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> and by the "Book of the Miracles of <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a>". During the last generation no question has given rise to more animated polemics among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> than the apostolate of <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a>.

<p>Under the Merovingians and Carolingians most of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a> resided at Dijon, e.g. St. Urbanus (fifth century), St. Gregory, and St. Tetricus (sixth century), who were buried there. When, in 1016, Lambert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, ceded the seigniory and county of Dijon to King Robert, the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a> made Langres their place of residence. In 1731, <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> made Dijon a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. The Abbey of Saint-Etienne of Dijon (fifth century) long had a regular chapter that observed the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>; it was given over to secular canons by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> in 1611, and <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> made its church the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Dijon; during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> it was transformed into a forage storehouse. The abbatial church of Saint-B&eacute;nigne became the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Dijon early in the nineteenth century. Cardinal Lecot, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dijon from 1886 to 1890. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X's</a> request in 1904 for the resignation of Monseigneur Le Nordez, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dijon since 1899, was one of the incidents which led to the rupture of relations between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>Romanesque architecture was very popular in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; its masterpiece is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Saint-B&eacute;nigne of Dijon, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Paschal II in 1106 and completed in 1288. The <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, although less used, characterizes the churches of Notre-Dame de Dijon (1252-1334), Notre-Dame de Semur, and l'Abbaye Saint-Seine; it was also the style of the Sainte-Chapelle of Dijon, which is no longer in existence. Under the dukes of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, at the close of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth century, <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> art flourished in a surprising degree. The Chartreuse of Champmol, on which Philip the Bold had Claus Sluter, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, at work from 1389 to 1406, and which was the acme of artistic excellence, was almost totally destroyed during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>; however, two superb traces of it may still be seen, namely the <em>Puits des proph&egrave;tes</em> and the portal of the church. The Beaune <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> (1443) is a fine specimen of the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, and the church of Saint-Michel in Dijon (1497) has sixteenth- and seventeenth-century <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porches</a> covered with fantastic <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a>. The Abbeys of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, Fontenay, and Flavigny (where in the nineteenth century <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">P&egrave;re Lacordaire</a> installed a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>) were all within the territory of Dijon. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">CISTERCIANS</a> and <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&Icirc;TEAUX</a>.)

<p>The following <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are specially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>: Saint Sequanus (Seine), b. at Magny, d. 580, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of R&eacute;omais around which sprang up the little town of Saint-Seine; <a href="../cathen/15630a.htm">St. William</a> (961-1031), a native of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Saint B&eacute;nigne at Dijon in 990, and <a href="../cathen/12711a.htm">reformer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> in the eleventh century; <a href="../cathen/13097d.htm">St. Robert of Molesme</a>, joint founder with Sts. Alberic and <a href="../cathen/14290d.htm">Stephen Harding</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> in 1098; <a href="../cathen/14290d.htm">St. Stephen Harding</a>, who died in 1134, third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, under whose administration the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of La Fert&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/12233a.htm">Pontigny</a>, <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10570a.htm">Morimond</a> were established; <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> (1090-1153); <a href="../cathen/08282c.htm">St. Jane Frances de Chantal</a> (1572-1641), b. at Dijon, who, having heard <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales'</a> <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> discourses at Dijon in 1604, conceived a holy friendship for him; the Venerable B&eacute;nigne Joly, canon of Saint-Etienne de Dijon (seventeenth century); and the Venerable Sister Marguerite of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> (1619-48), surnamed the "little saint of Beaune", noted for the apparitions of the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> with which she was favoured, in consequence of which the pious association known as the Family of the Holy Child Jesus was organized and later raised by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to the dignity of an archconfraternity. Among the famous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the Seneschal Philippe Pot (1428-94) is remembered for his exploits against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1452 and his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> deliverance from his captors. The illustrious <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> was a native of Dijon. Hubert Languet, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> publicist (1518-81), was born at Vitteaux.

<p>The chief places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: Notre-Dame de Beaune, at Beaune (antedating 1120); Notre-Dame du Bon-Espoir at Dijon, dedicated in 1334; Notre-Dame du Chemin, near Serrigny (twelfth or thirteenth century); Notre-Dame de <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> (end of the eleventh century) visited by many famous rulers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and the East; Notre-Dame d'Etang at V&eacute;lars (fifteenth century), visited by <a href="../cathen/08282c.htm">St. Jane Frances de Chantal</a>, St. Francis de Sales, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>; and Notre-Dame de L&eacute;e (tenth or eleventh century) visited by St. Benedict Labre. The room in which St. Bernard was born was transformed into a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Fontaine-les-Dijon and visited by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, Anne of Austria, Cond&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/08282c.htm">St. Jane Frances de Chantal</a>, St. Francis de Sales, and <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">M. Olier</a>. St. Regina (Reine), who was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Alise in the third century and whose body was transported to Flavigny in 864, is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>; formerly it was customary to hold a theatrical procession in which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and her <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> were represented.

<p>In 1905, prior to the enforcement of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> against congregations, there were in the diocese <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> missionaries, also the following local congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: Sisters of the Good Shepherd, founded at Dijon in the seventeenth century by Venerable B&eacute;nigne Joly; <a href="../cathen/11698b.htm">Sisters of the Perpetual Adoration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>; Sisters of Providence, whose mother-house is at Vitteaux, and who conduct a great many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, with mother-house at Dijon; the Sisters of St. Martha, devoted alike to <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work and teaching (founded in 1628) at Dijon. In 1899 the following institutions were conducted by religious: 32 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; 3 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, with agricultural training; 9 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 5 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; 1 institution for penitent <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; 1 servants' guild; 18 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or hospices; 25 houses for nursing sisters; 3 houses of retreat; and 1 insane asylum. In 1905 (end of the Concordatory period) the Diocese of Dijon had a population of 361,626; 38 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (cures), 447 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (mission churches), and 13 curacies subventioned by the State.
