<h1>Dimissorial Letters</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>litter&aelig; dimissoriales</em>, from <em>dimittere</em>), letters given by an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior to his subjects to have effect in territory outside his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The term is sometimes extended so as to include testimonial letters, which certify to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> freedom from canonical impediments or to the fact that a candidate for a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order has the requisite qualities, and commendatory letters, which testify that a traveling ecclesiastic is unexceptionable as to <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and letters of excorporation (see EXEAT), by which <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are freed from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of one <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (see EXCARDINATION) that they may be affiliated to another diocese. Properly the name "dimissorial letters" refers to those given by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or regular <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> to his subjects in order that they may be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone may concede such dimissorial letters for the whole world, but any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can give them to those under his authority, whether they be so by origin, domicile, or <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, can likewise grant them to those who for three years have been actually or equivalently members of his household (<em>familiares</em>). In the absence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, his vice-general is empowered to grant dimissorial letters, but not while the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is at home, unless he has received special permission to do so. During the vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> cannot give these letters, unless a year has elapsed since the diocese became <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, except to one who is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to receive orders owing to his having acquired a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. After the lapse of a year, the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>, independent of the chapter, has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to grant dimissorial letters for the reception of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> give the letters illegitimately, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> is not entitled to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> privileges, if he be in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>; and if in major orders, he is suspended from the exercise of them until the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> free him from the penalty. Abbots, even though exempt, cannot grant dimissorial letters to seculars who are subject to them. When a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> grants letters directed to other ordinaries, this phrase does not include exempt <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. Regular <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> can give letters to those religious who live under their obedience, but such letters must be directed to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, unless there be a special privilege. In case of the absence of the ordinary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or if he does not desire to hold ordinations, religious superiors may send their subjects to any other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. When regulars live in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <em>nullius dioecesis</em>, these letters are to be directed to the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<em>vicinior</em>). Religious orders, which have received such special privilege since the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, may send their subjects for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whatsoever. As regards the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, those who dwell in the city for four months cannot be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> outside the city in virtue of dimissorial letters from their ordinary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but they must present themselves to the <a href="../cathen/03341b.htm">Cardinal Vicar of Rome</a> for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> can ordain anyone without letters from his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> so <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> cannot later be promoted to higher orders without <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> licence Although dimissorial letters be required for ordaining the subject of one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in another diocese, yet it does seem <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to obtain them for the purpose of receiving a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> in the other diocese, though it is considered proper and expedient.
