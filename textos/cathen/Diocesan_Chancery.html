<h1>Diocesan Chancery</h1>  

<p>That branch of administration which handles all written documents used in the official government of a diocese. It is in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chancery that, under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his representative, all documents which concern the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are drawn up, copied, forwarded, and a record kept of all official writings expedited or received. The official charged with the execution of these <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> is known as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chancellor. In many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the chancellor exercises some of the faculties which in other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are exclusively reserved to the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. This happens more frequently in smaller <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, administered directly by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself, and in which the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (often not resident in the episcopal city) is called on only when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is absent or hindered. In such cases the chancellor is also the confidential secretary of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A similar system obtains even in many extensive <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> which are administered by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with the aid of one or more vicars-general and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chancery. There are, however, some large <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in which all matters personally reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are executed by him with the aid of a secretary or chancellor, usually a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, while the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> administration is handed over to a body of officials under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. For the correspondence, registration, and care of the archives, such administrative bureaux are provided with a secretariat or chancery. The chancery is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> element of administration in every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Some provision for its <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> must be made, even in missionary <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, in Apostolic prefectures and vicariates. Unless the official correspondence were properly cared for, there would be no tradition in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> management, important documents would be lost, and the written evidence <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in lawsuits and trials would be lacking. The famous Apostolic Chancery (<em>Cancellaria Apostolica</em>) developed in time from the chancery of the primitive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>. By reason of the latter's primacy in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, his chancery naturally had far wider relations than that of any other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Christian diocese</a>.

<p>It is somewhat strange, given the necessity and, generally speaking, the universality of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chanceries, to find that there is nothing in the common ecclesiastical law concerning their creation and equipment. The explanation lies in the very nature of this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which provides only for what is general and common, and takes no account of local means of administration, which it abandons to the proper authority in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the concrete circumstances offering always great variety and calling for all possible freedom of action. Nor has the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> ever legislated concerning <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chanceries; even the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> is not made <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>. Although, as above described, the methods of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> administration exhibit no little variety, there exists on the other hand a certain uniformity. Each diocese, after all, is bound to observe the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, has an identical range of freedom, and identical limits to its authority. Each diocese, therefore, is likely, a priori, to develop its administration along similar lines, but does so regularly in harmony with others, particularly neighbouring <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In this way the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of a given country come to have similar official administration. In the course of the last century the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> system was generally introduced in many countries whose churches had hitherto been under a more or less provisional government (e.g. <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>). Naturally, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of these new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> sought at once to provide for an orderly administration and the establishment of suitable methods for the same. Thus we see that the more recent national and <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> lay much stress on the creation of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chanceries. The First <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1852) expressed the wish that in every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> there should be a chancery, to facilitate <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration and establish for its conduct a more or less identical system. The <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">National Synod</a> of Thurles in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (1850) made provision for the establishment and preservation of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> archives. Similarly for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the Provincial Synod of Westminster (1852).

<p>In keeping with these recommendations the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chancery consists of a certain number of officials named by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and Australia there are usually, besides the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chancellor and a secretary. In <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the chancery is organized variously, according to the extent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. There is generally in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> a chancellor or secretary with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> personnel. In the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> much of the administration is carried on by an official bureau (Offizialat) as described above, i.e. the vicariate-general, to which are adjoined a secretariat, a registry office, and a chancery. In the <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Diocese of Breslau</a> there exists an institution known as the "Secret Chancery" (Geheimkanzlei) which expedites only matters decided by the prince-bishop personally or with the advice of this body. The prince-bishop presides over its sessions with the help of the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. Its members are three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and one lay counsellor to whom are added a secretary, a chief of the chancery, two private secretaries, a registrar, etc. The ordinary <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> administration is carried on by two other bureaux, the vicariate-general and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consistory, mutually independent, but both acting in the name of the prince-bishop. For the office of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chancellor in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> see "Acta et Decreta" of the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, in index, p. 303, and of the Synod of Maynooth (1900), s.v. "Archiva". (See also <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">VICAR-GENERAL</a>; <a href="../cathen/01696a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL ARCHIVES</a>.)
