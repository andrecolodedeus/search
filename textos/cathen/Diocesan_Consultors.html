<h1>Diocesan Consultors</h1>  

<p>Diocesan consultors are a certain number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> who act as official advisers of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in certain matters pertaining to the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. As a body they take the place of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter as established elsewhere by the general law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Their appointment was recommended (1866) by the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>. The Third Plenary Council (1884) decreed that they should be constituted a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> council, and defined their particular <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>.
<h2>Manner of appointment</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors, it was decreed (n. 18), should be six, or at least four, in number. Where neither number is possible, there should be at least two. They hold office for three years; but they may be reappointed or selected at the expiration of each term. The manner of their election consists in the appointment by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone of half of their number, and of the other half by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> also, after having taken the vote of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. All the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> exercising the sacred ministry in the diocese send, in writing, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> three names for every consultor to be elected. From the names thus proposed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> selects those whom he judges most fit for the office. At stated periods they are convened and presided over by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, four times, or at least twice, a year, and, as occasion requires, monthly. In case of the death resignation, or removal of a consultor, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appoints his successor with the advice of the other consultors.
<h2>Rights and duties</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> council has certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>: (A) when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is filled, and (B) when it is <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>.
<h3 id="A">A</h3>

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is filled, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is bound to ask the advice of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors: <ul><li>(1) For convoking and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod; <li>(2) for dividing missions or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; <li>(3) for giving over a mission or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> to a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community; <li>(4) for appointing deputies for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; <li>(5) for appointing a new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultor and synodal examiners to conduct the examination for vacant <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; <li>(6) for alienating <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, when the sum exceeds five thousand dollars; <li>(7) for determining what missions are to be made <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with irremovable rectors and appointing the first irremovable rectors in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; <li>(8) for fixing the pension of an irremovable <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> who has resigned or who has been removed for cause; <li>(9) for determining, out of synod, the salary of rectors.</ul>

<p>In all these cases the consultors give their opinion collectively, i.e. in a body, and by secret ballot if they deem proper. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, however, although bound to seek their advice in these matters, is not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to follow it.
<h3 id="B">B</h3>

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is vacant: <ul><li>(1) the administrator must follow the same procedure, i.e. he must ask the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors in the above-stated cases. <li>(2) The expiration of the three-year term of the consultors within the period of the vacancy does not affect their tenure of office. They remain in office until the accession of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who, within six months from his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, should hold a new election of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors. <li>(3) In the election of a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the council of 1884 conceded a voice to the consultors, as representatives of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Together with the irremovable rectors they meet within thirty days after the vacancy occurs under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the province, or, if he be hindered, of a suffragan deputed by him. If the vacancy be that of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> the senior suffragan presides, or one deputed by him. The voting is by secret ballot. Three candidates are selected whose names are sent to the S. Cong. de Propagand&acirc; Fide, and to the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province, who meet, within ten days, to approve or disapprove of the candidates presented by the consultors and irremovable rectors. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> send their own list to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may reject both lists and appoint as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> some one who is on neither. <li>(4) When there is a question of selecting a coadjutor with the right of succession the consultors with the irremovable rectors have a voice just as in the election of a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <li>(5) This is also the case where a new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is formed out of one or more existing <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In that case, only the irremovable rectors within the limits of the new diocese join with the consultors of the older diocese or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">PLENARY COUNCILS OF BALTIMORE</a>.)</ul>
