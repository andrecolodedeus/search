<h1>Diocese</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> di&oelig;cesis)

<p>A Diocese is the territory or churches subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Origin of term</h2>

<p>Originally the term <em>diocese</em> (Gr. <em>dioikesis</em>) signified management of a household, thence administration or government in general. This term was soon used in <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> to designate the territory dependent for its administration upon a city (<em>civitas</em>). What in Latin was called <em>ager</em>, or <em>territorium</em>, namely a district subject to a city, was habitually known in the Roman East as a <em>di&oelig;cesis</em>. But as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian bishop</a> generally resided in a <em>civitas</em>, the territory administered by him, being usually conterminous with the juridical territory of the city, came to be known ecclesiastically by its usual civil term, <em>diocese</em>. This name was also given to the administrative subdivision of some provinces ruled by <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> (<em>legati</em>) under the authority of the governor of the province. Finally, <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> designated by this name the twelve great divisions which he established in the empire, and over each of which he placed a <em>vicarius</em> (Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclop&auml;die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, Stuttgart, 1903, V, 1, 716 sqq.). The original term for local groups of the faithful subject to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <em>ekklesia</em> (church), and at a later date, <em>paroikia</em>, i.e. the neighbourhood (Lat. por&oelig;cia, parochia). The <a href="../cathen/03279a.htm">Apostolic Canons</a> (xiv, xv), and the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> in 325 (can. xvi) applied this latter term to the territory subject to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This term was retained in the East, where the Council of Constantinople (381) reserved the word <em>diocese</em> for the territory subject to a patriarch (can. ii). In the West also <em>parochia</em> was long used to designate an episcopal see. About 850 <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a>, and about 1095 <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, still employed <em>parochia</em> to denote the territory subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1159-1181) designated under the name of <em>parochiani</em> the subjects of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (c. 4, C. X, qu. 1; c. 10, C. IX, qu. 2; c. 9, X, De testibus, II, 20). On the other hand, the present meaning of the word <em>diocese</em> is met with in Africa at the end of the fourth century (cc. 50, 51, C. XVI, qu. 1), and afterwards in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where the term <em>parochia</em>, occurring in the ninth canon of the Council of Antioch, held in 341, was translated by "diocese" (c. 2, C. IX, qu. 3). See also the ninth canon of the Synod of Toledo, in 589 (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, ad h. an. and c. 6, C. X, qu. 3). This usage finally became general in the West, though <em>diocese</em> was sometimes used to indicate <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the present sense of the word (see <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">PARISH</a>). In Gaul, the words <em>terminus</em>, <em>territorium</em>, <em>civitas</em>, <em>pagus</em>, are also met with.
<h2 id="section2">Historical origin</h2>

<p>It is impossible to determine what rules were followed at the origin of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in limiting the territory over which each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> exercised his authority. Universality of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> was a personal prerogative of the Apostles; their successors, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, enjoyed only a <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> limited to a certain territory: thus Ignatius was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Christian</a> communities, quite like the Jewish, were established in towns. The converts who lived in the neighbourhood naturally joined with the community of the town for the celebration of the Sacred Mysteries. Exact limitations of episcopal territory could not have engrossed much attention at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; it would have been quite impracticable. As a matter of fact, the extent of the diocese was determined by the domain itself over which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> exercised his influence. It seems certain on the other hand, that, in the East at any rate, by the middle of the third century each <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community of any importance had become the residence of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and constituted a diocese. There were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the country districts as well as in the towns. The <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a> (<em>en chora episkopoi</em>), or rural <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, it is generally thought, as well as those of the towns; though from about the second half of the third century their powers were little by little curtailed, and they were made dependent on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the towns. To this rule <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was an exception; Alexandria was for a long time the only see in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> dioceses, however, multiplied rapidly during the third century, so that in 320 there were about a hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present at the <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Council of Alexandria</a>. The number of dioceses was also quite large in some parts of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, i.e. in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. In other regions of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, either <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had as yet a small number of adherents, or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> reserved to themselves supreme authority over extensive districts. Thus, in this early period but few dioceses existed in Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Britain, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In the last, however, their number increased rapidly during the third century. The increase of the faithful in small towns and country districts soon made it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to determine exactly the limits of the territory of each church. The cities of the empire, with their clearly defined suburban districts, offered limits that were easily acceptable. From the fourth century on it was generally admitted that every city ought to have its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and that his territory was bounded by that of the neighbouring city. This rule was stringently applied in the East. Although <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> declared in 415 that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was not bound to conform itself to all the civil divisions which the imperial government chose to introduce, the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> ordered (451) that if a <em>civitas</em> were dismembered by imperial authority, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization ought also to be modified (can. xvii). In the West, the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (344) forbade in its sixth canon the establishment of dioceses in towns not populous enough to render desirable their elevation to the dignity of episcopal residences. At the same time many Western sees included the territories of several <em>civitates</em>.



<p>From the fourth century we have documentary evidence of the manner in which the dioceses were created. According to the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (can. vi), this belonged to the provincial synod; the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, in 407, demanded moreover the consent of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the diocese to be divided (canons iv and v). The consent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or the emperor was not called for. In 446, however, <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a> ruled that dioceses should not be established except in large towns and populous centres (c. 4, Dist. lxxx). In the same period the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> was active in the creation of dioceses in the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> kingdom and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In the latter country many of the sees had no other <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> than the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and were thus more closely related to him. Even clearer is his r&ocirc;le in the formation of the diocesan system in the northern countries newly <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. After the first successes of St. Augustine in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> provided for the establishment of two <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a>, each of which included two dioceses. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the diocesan system was introduced by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, though the diocesan territory was usually coextensive with the tribal lands, and the system itself was soon peculiarly modified by the general extension of monasticism (see <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">IRELAND</a>). In <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, however, the diocesan organization dates only from the twelfth century. To the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> also was due the establishment of dioceses in that part of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> which had been evangelized by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire the boundaries of the dioceses followed the earlier Gallo-Roman municipal system, though the Merovingian kings never hesitated to change them by royal authority and without pontifical intervention. In the creation of new dioceses no mention is made of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority. The <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> kings and their successors, the Western emperors, notably the Ottos (936-1002), sought <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority for the creation of new dioceses. Since the eleventh century it has been the rule that the establishment of new dioceses is peculiarly a right of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> proclaimed (1059-60) this as a general principle (c. 1, Dist. xxii), and the same is affirmed in the well-known "Dictatus" of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (1073-1085). The <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">PAPAL DECRETALS</a>) consider the creation of a new diocese as one of the <em>caus&oelig; majores</em>, i.e. matters of special importance, reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone (c. 1, X, De translatione episcopi, I, 7; c. 1, X, De officio legati, I, 30) and of which he is the sole judge (c. 5, Extrav. communes, De pr&aelig;bendis et dignitatibus, III, 2). A word of mention is here due to the missionary or regionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <em>episcopi gentium</em>, <em>episcopi</em> (<em>archiepiscopi</em>) <em>in gentibus</em>, still found in the eleventh century. They had no fixed territory or diocese, but were sent into a country or district for the purpose of evangelizing it. Such were <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, St. Augustine in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. They were themselves the organizers of the diocese, after their apostolic labours had produced <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> results. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met with in some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Gaul in the earlier <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, probably in imitation of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> conditions, had no administrative functions (see Bellesheim, Gesch. d. kath. Kirche in Irland, I, 226-30, and L&ocirc;ning, below).
<h2 id="section3">Creation and modification of dioceses</h2>

<p>We have noticed above that after the eleventh century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> reserved to himself the creation of dioceses. In the actual discipline, as already stated, all that touches the diocese is a <em>causa major</em>, i.e. one of those important matters in which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> possesses no authority whatever and which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> reserves exclusively to himself. Since the episcopate is of Divine institution, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to establish dioceses in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but he remains sole judge of the time and manner, and alone determines what flock shall be entrusted to each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Generally speaking, the diocese is a territorial circumscription, but sometimes the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> possesses authority only over certain classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> residing in the territory; this is principally the case in districts where both the Western and the Eastern Rite are followed. Whatever, therefore, pertains to the creation or suppression of dioceses, changes in their boundaries, and the like is within the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> exclusive province. As a general rule, the preparatory work is done by the Congregation of the Consistory, by <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> when the question relates to territories subject to this congregation, and by the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs when the establishment of a diocese is governed by <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a>, or when the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> of the country has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to intervene in their creation. We shall take up successively (1) the creation of new dioceses (2) the various modifications to which they are subject, included by canonists under the term <em>Innovatio</em>.
<h3 id="A">Creation of dioceses</h3>

<p>Strictly speaking, it is only in missionary countries that there can be question of the creation of a diocese, either because the country was never <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> or because its ancient <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was suppressed, owing to conquest by infidels or the progress of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Regularly, before becoming a diocese, the territory is successively a mission, a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a>, and finally a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> makes a preliminary study of the question and passes judgment on the opportuneness of the creation of the diocese in question. It considers principally whether the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and religious establishments, i.e. churches, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, is sufficiently large to justify the establishment of the proposed diocese. These matters form the subject of a report to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, to which must be added the number of towns or settlements included in the territory. If there is a city suitable for the episcopal see, the fact is stated, also the financial resources at the disposal of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the works of religion. There is added, finally, a sketch, if possible accompanied by a map, indicating the territory of the future diocese. As a general rule, a diocese should not include districts whose inhabitants speak different languages or are subject to distinct <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil powers</a> (see Instructions of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, 1798, in Collectanea S. C. de P. F., Rome, 1907, no. 645). Moreover, the general conditions for, the creation of a diocese are the same as those required for dividing or "dismembering" a diocese. Of this we shall speak below.
<h3 id="B">Modification (<em>innovatio</em>) of dioceses</h3>

<p>Under this head come the division (<em>dismembratio</em>) of dioceses, their union, suppression, and changes of their respective limits.
<h3 id="A">Division or dismemberment of a diocese</h3>

<p>This is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Since the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is the supreme power in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he is not bound to act in conformity with the canonical enactments which regulate the dismemberment of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. The following rules, however, are those which he generally observes, though he is free to deviate from them. &mdash; First, to divide a diocese, a sufficient reason must exist (<em>causa justa</em>). The necessity, or at least the utility, of the division must be demonstrated. There is sufficient reason for the subdivision of a diocese if it be too extensive, or the number of the faithful too great, or the means of communication too difficult, to permit the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to administer the diocese properly. The benefit which would result to religion (<em>incrementum cultus divini</em>) may also be brought forward as a reason for the change. In the main, these reasons are summed up in the one: the hope of forwarding the interests of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Dissensions between inhabitants of the same diocese, or the fact that they belong to different nations, may also be considered a sufficient reason. Formerly, the mere fact that the endowment of a diocese was very large &mdash; a case somewhat rare at the present day &mdash; formed a legitimate reason for its division.

<p>The second condition is suitability of place (<em>locucongruus</em>). There should exist in the diocese to be created a city or town suitable for the episcopal residence; the ancient discipline which rules that sees should be established only in important localities is still observed.

<p>Third, a proper endowment (<em>dos congrua</em>) is requisite. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should have at his disposal the resources <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for his own maintenance and that of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> engaged in the general administration of the diocese, and for the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, the expenses of Divine worship, and the general administration of the diocese. Formerly it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that in part, at least, this endowment should consist in lands; at present this is not always possible. It suffices if there is a prospect that the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> will be able to meet the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> expenses. In some cases, the civil government grants a subsidy to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; in other cases, he must depend on the liberality of the faithful and on a contribution from the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the diocese, known as the cathedraticum.

<p>Fourth, generally for the division of a diocese the consent of the actual incumbent of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> is requisite; but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is not bound to observe this condition. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> ruled that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to proceed to the division of a diocese in spite of the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (c. 5, Extrav. common., De pr&aelig;bendis, III, 2). As a matter of fact, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> asks the advice of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> in which the diocese to be divided is situated. Often, indeed, the division takes place at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself.

<p>Fifth, theoretically the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> is not required; this would be contrary to the principles of the distinction and mutual independence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>. In many countries, however, the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> is indispensable, either because the Government has pledged itself to endow the occupants of the episcopal sees, or because <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> have regulated this matter, or because a suspicious government would not permit a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to administer the new diocese if it were created without civil intervention (see Nussi, Conventiones de rebus ecclesiasticis, Rome, 1869, pp. 19 sqq.). At present, the creation or division of a diocese is done by a pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, forwarded by the Secretary of Briefs. As an example, we may mention the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 11 March, 1904, which divided the <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Diocese of Providence</a> and established the new <a href="../cathen/05771a.htm">Diocese of Fall River</a>. The motive prompting this division was the <em>incrementum religionis</em> and the <em>majus bonum animarum;</em> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a> himself requested the division, and this request was approved by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> and by all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of that <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. The examination of the question was submitted to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> at Washington. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then created, <em>motu proprio</em>, the new diocese, indicated its official title in Latin and in English, and determined its boundaries, which correspond to political divisions, and, finally, fixed the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the case before us these consist in a moderate cathedraticum to be determined by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<em>discreto arbitrio episcopi imponendum</em>). According to the practice of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who at the time of the division exercised the ministry in the dismembered territory belong to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the new diocese (Rescript of 13 April, 1891, in Collectanea S. C. de P. F., new ed., no. 1751).
<h3 id="B">Union of dioceses</h3>

<p>As in the case of the division of a diocese, the union of several dioceses ought to be justified by motives of public utility, e.g. the small number of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, the loss of resources. As in the case of division, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is influenced by the advice of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> familiar with the situation; sometimes he asks the advice of the Government, etc. It is a generally recognized principle in the union of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, that such union takes effect only after the death of the actual occupant of the see which is to be united to another; at least when he has not given his consent to this union. Though the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is not bound by this rule, in practice it must be taken into account. The union of dioceses takes place in several ways. There is, first, the <em>unio &oelig;que principalis</em> or <em>&oelig;qualis</em> when the two dioceses are entrusted for the purpose of administration to a single <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, though they remain in all other respects distinct; each of them has its own <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, revenues, <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and privileges, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of one see becomes the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the other by the mere fact of appointment to one of the two. He cannot resign one without <em>ipso facto</em> resigning the other. This situation differs from that in which a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> administers for a time, or even perpetually, another diocese; in this case there is no union between the two sees. It is in reality a case of plurality of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> holds two distinct sees, and his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> must take place according to the rules established for each of the two dioceses. On the contrary, in the case of two or more united dioceses, the election or designation of the candidate must take place by the agreement of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in both dioceses who possess the right of election or of designation. Moreover, in the case of united dioceses, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sometimes makes special rules for the residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, e.g. that he shall reside in each diocese for a part of the year. If the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> makes no decision in this matter, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may reside in the more important diocese, or in that which seems more convenient for the purposes of administration, or even in the diocese which he prefers as a residence. If the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> resides in one of his dioceses he is considered as present in each of them for those juridical acts which demand his presence. He may also convoke at his discretion two separate diocesan <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> for each of the two dioceses or only one for both of them. In other respects the administration of each diocese remains distinct. There are two classes of unequal unions of dioceses (<em>uniones in&oelig;quales</em>): the <em>unio subjectiva</em> or <em>per accessorium</em>, seldom put into practice, and the <em>unio per confusionem</em>. In the former case, the one diocese retains all its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and the other loses its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, obtains those of the principal diocese, and thus becomes a dependency. When a diocese is thus united to another there can be no question of right of election or designation, because such a dependent diocese is conferred by the very fact that the principal diocese possesses a titular. But the administration of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of each diocese remains distinct and the titular of the principal diocese must assume all the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the united diocese. The second kind of union (<em>per confusionem</em>) suppresses the two pre-existing dioceses in order to create a new one; the former dioceses simply cease to exist. To perpetuate the names of the former sees the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sometimes assumes the titles of both, but in administration no account is taken of the fact that they were formerly separate sees. Such a union is equivalent to the suppression of the dioceses.
<h3 id="C">Suppression of dioceses</h3>

<p>Suppression of dioceses, properly so called, in a manner other than by union, takes place only in countries where the faithful and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have been dispersed by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the ancient dioceses becoming missions, prefectures, or <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a>. This has occurred in the Orient, in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, etc. Changes of this nature are not regulated by canon law.
<h3 id="D">Change of boundaries</h3>

<p>This last mode of <em>innovatio</em> is made by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, generally at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the two neighbouring dioceses. Among the sufficient reasons for this measure are the difficulty of communication, the existence of a high mountain or of a large river, disputes between the inhabitants of one part of the diocese, also the fact that they belong to different countries. Sometimes a resettlement of the boundaries of two dioceses is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> because the limits of each are not clearly defined. Such a settlement is made by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, sometimes also by a simple <em>decretum</em> or decision of the Congregation of the Consistory approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, without the formality of a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> or <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Different classes of dioceses</h2>

<p>There are several kinds of dioceses. There are dioceses properly so called and <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a>. The diocese is the territorial circumscription administered by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; the archdiocese is placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Considered as a territorial circumscription, no difference exists between them; the power of their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> alone is different. Generally, several dioceses are grouped in an <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> and are subject to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Some, however, are said to be exempt, i.e. from any <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and are placed directly under the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Such are the dioceses of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and several other dioceses or <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, also in other countries. The exempt <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> are called titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, i.e. they possess only the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, have no suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and administer a diocese. The term "titular archbishop", it is to be noted, is also applied to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who do not administer a diocese, but who have received with the episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> a titular <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>. For the better understanding of this it must be remembered that <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> and dioceses are divided into titular and residential. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a residential see administers his diocese personally and is bound to reside in it, whereas the <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have only an episcopal title; they are not bound by any <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to the faithful of the dioceses whose titles they bear. These were formerly called <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus infidelium</a></em>, i.e. of a diocese or archdiocese fallen into the power of infidels; but since 1882 they are called <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. Such are the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a>, administrators Apostolic, <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a>, Apostolic delegates, etc. (see TITULAR BISHOP). Mention must also be made of the <a href="../cathen/14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> dioceses (<em>di&oelig;ceses suburbicari&oelig;</em>), i.e. the six dioceses situated in the immediate neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and each of which is administered by one of the six <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a>. These form a special class of dioceses, the titulars or occupants of which possess certain special <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> (see <a href="../cathen/14324a.htm">SUBURBICARIAN DIOCESES</a>).
<h2 id="section5">Nomination, translation, renunciation, and deposition of a bishop</h2>

<p>The general rules relating to the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a residential <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> will be found in the article <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">BISHOP</a>. They are applicable whatever may have been the cause of the vacancy of the diocese, except in the case of a contrary order of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> admits the principle of the perpetuity of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. Once invested with a see the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> continues to hold it until his death. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may be allowed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to resign his see when actuated by motives which do not spring from personal convenience, but from concern for the public good. Some of these reasons are expressed in the canon law; for instance, if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has been guilty of a grave crime (<em>conscientia criminis</em>), if he is in failing health (<em>debilitas corporis</em>), if he has not the requisite <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>defectus scienti&oelig;</em>), if he meets with serious opposition from the faithful (<em>malitia plebis</em>), if he has been a cause of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">public scandal</a> (<em>scandalum populi</em>), if he is irregular (<em>irregularitas</em>) &mdash; c. 10, X, De renuntiatione, I, 9; c. 18, X, De regularibus, III, 32. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone can accept this renunciation and judge of the sufficiency of the alleged reasons. Pontifical authorization is also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for an exchange of dioceses between two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, which is not allowed except for grave reasons. The same principles apply to the transfer (<em>translatio</em>) of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from one diocese to another. Canonical legislation compares with the indissoluble marriage tie the bond which binds the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to his diocese. This comparison, however, must not be understood literally. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has the power to sever the mystical bond which unites the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to his church, in order to grant him another diocese or to promote him to an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may also be deposed from his functions for a grave crime. In such a case the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> generally invites the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to resign of his own accord, and deposes him only upon refusal. As the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> alone is competent to try the crime of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone, or the congregation to which he has committed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> trial (Congregation of Bishops and Regulars, the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>), can inflict this penalty or pronounce the declaratory sentence required when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> inflicts deposition as the sanction of a specified delinquency. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has always the right, strictly speaking, to deprive a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his diocese, even if the latter is not guilty of crime; but for this act there must be grave cause. After the conclusion of the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> removed from their dioceses all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. It was, of course, a very extraordinary measure, but was justified by the gravity of the situation.
<h2 id="section6">Administration of the diocese</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the general ruler of the diocese, but in his administration he must conform to the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">BISHOP</a>). According to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> he is bound to divide the territory of his diocese into <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> for their titulars (Sess. XXIV, c. xiii, De ref.), unless circumstances render impossible the creation of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or unless the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has arranged the matter otherwise (Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, nos. 31-33). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> needs also some auxiliary service in the administration of a diocese. It is customary for each diocese to possess a chapter of canons in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>; they are the counsellors of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> itself is the church where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has his seat (<em>kathedra</em>). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> reserves to himself the right of authorizing its establishment as well as that of a chapter of canons. In many dioceses, principally outside of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> does not establish canons, but gives as auxiliaries to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> other officials known as <em>consultores cleri di&oelig;cesani</em>, i.e. the most distinguished members of the diocesan <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, chosen by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, often in concert with his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or some members of it. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is bound to ask the advice of those counsellors, canons or consultors, in the most important matters. The canons possess, in some cases, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to nullify episcopal action taken without their consent. The <em>consultores cleri di&oelig;cesani</em>, however, possess but a consultative voice (Third Plen. Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, nos. 17-22; Plen. Cone. Americ&aelig; Latin&aelig;, no. 246. &mdash; See <a href="../cathen/04323a.htm">DIOCESAN CONSULTORS</a>). After the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the principal authority in a diocese is the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (<em>vicarius generalis in spiritualibus</em>); he is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> substitute in the administration of the diocese. The office dates from the thirteenth century. Originally the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> was called the "official" (<em>officialis</em>); even yet <em>officialis</em> and <em>vicarius generalis in spiritualibus</em> are synonymous. Strictly speaking, there should be in each diocese only one <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. In some countries, however, local custom has authorized the appointment of several vicars-general. The one specially charged with the canonical lawsuits (<em>jurisdictio contentiosa</em>), e.g. with criminal actions against <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> or with matrimonial cases, is still known as the "official" it must be noted that he is none the less free to exercise the functions of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in other departments of diocesan administration. A contrary custom prevails in certain dioceses of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where the "official" possesses only the <em>jurisdictio contentiosa</em>, but this is a derogation from the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>. For the temporal administration of the church the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may appoint an <em>&oelig;conomus</em>, i.e. an administrator. As such functions do not require <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>, this administrator may be a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. The choice of a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> fully acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> of the country may sometimes offer many advantages (Second <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, no. 75). In certain very extensive dioceses the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appoints a <em>vicarius generalis in pontificalibus</em>, or <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is to supply the place of the diocesan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the exercise of those functions of the sacred ministry which demand episcopal order. In the appointment of this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is not bound to observe the special rules for the appointment of a residential <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. These <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> possess no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> by right of their office; the diocesan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, however, can grant them, e.g., the powers of a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>.

<p>The common ecclesiastical law contains no enactments relating to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and powers of the chancellor, an official met with in many dioceses (see <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">DIOCESAN CHANCERY</a>). The <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (no. 71) advises the establishment of a chancery in every diocese of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The chancellor is specially charged with the affixing of the episcopal seal to all acts issued in the name of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in order to prove their authenticity. He appears also in the conduct of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lawsuits, e.g. in matrimonial cases, to prove the authenticity of the alleged documents, to vouch for the depositions of witnesses, etc. Because of the importance of his functions, the chancellor sometimes holds the office of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> <em>in spiritualibus</em>. By episcopal chancery is sometimes understood the office where are written the documents issued in the name of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and to which is addressed the correspondence relating to the administration of the diocese sometimes also the term signifies the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> employed in the exercise of these functions. The taxes or dues which the episcopal chancery may claim for the issuing of documents were fixed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXI, c. i, De ref.); afterwards by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> (hence their name <a href="../cathen/14467b.htm"><em>Taxa Innocentiana</em></a>), 8 Oct., 1678; finally by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 10 June, 1896. The fiscal of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, also known as <em>promotor</em> or <em>procurator fiscalis</em>, is the ecclesiastic charged with attending to the interests of the diocese in all trials and especially with endeavouring to secure the punishment of all offences cognizable in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunals. An assistant, who is called fiscal advocate (<em>advocatus fiscalis</em>), may be appointed to aid this officer.

<p>Formerly the diocese was divided into a number of archdeaconries, each administered by an <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, who possessed considerable authority in that part of the diocese placed under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> restricted very much their authority, and since then the office of the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> has gradually disappeared. It exists at the present day only as an honorary title, given to a canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter (see <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">ARCHDEACON</a>). On the other hand, the ancient office of <em>vicarii foranei</em>, <em>decani rurales</em>, or <em>archipresbyteri</em> still exists in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">ARCHPRIEST</a>; <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">DEAN</a>). The division of the diocese into deaneries is not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, but in large dioceses the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> usually entrusts to certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> known as deans or vicars forane the oversight of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of a portion of his diocese, and generally delegates to them special jurisdictional powers (Third Plen. Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, nos. 27-30). Finally, by means of the diocesan synod all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> participates in the general administration of the diocese. According to the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is bound to assemble a synod every year, to which he must convoke the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the deans, the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and at least a certain number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Here, however, custom and pontifical privileges have departed in some points from the general legislation. At this meeting, all questions relating to the moral and the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> of the diocese are publicly discussed and settled. In the synod the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the sole legislator; the members may, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, give their advice, but they have only a deliberative voice in the choice of the <em>examinatores cleri di&oelig;cesani</em>, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> charged with the examination of candidates for the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (Third Plen. Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, nos. 23-26). It is because the diocesan <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> are generally elaborated and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in a synod that they are sometimes known as <em>statuta synodalia</em>. In addition to the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the enactments of national or plenary and <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may regulate by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, that are often real ecclesiastical laws, the particular discipline of each diocese, or apply the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the special needs of the diocese. Since the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone possesses all the legislative power, and is not bound to propose in a synod these diocesan <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, he may modify them or add to them on his own authority.
<h2 id="section7">Vacancy of the diocese</h2>

<p>We have already explained how a diocese becomes vacant (see V above); here it will suffice to add a few words touching the administration of the diocese during such vacancy. In dioceses where there is a coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with right of succession, the latter, by the fact of the decease of the diocesan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, becomes the residential <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or ordinary (q.v.) of the diocese. Otherwise the government of the diocese during the vacancy belongs regularly to the chapter of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. The chapter must choose within eight days a <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>, whose powers, although less extensive, are in kind like those of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If the chapter does not fulfil this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> appoints <em>ex officio</em> a <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>. In dioceses where a chapter does not exist, an administrator is appointed, designated either by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself before his death, or, in case of his neglect, by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> or by the senior <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the province (see <a href="../cathen/01143a.htm">ADMINISTRATOR</a>).
