<h1>Diocese of Badajoz</h1>  

<p>(Pacensis.)

<p>The Latin name <em>Pax</em>, or <em>Civitas Pacensis</em>, was given to this district because it was thought to be the <em>Pax Julia</em> or <em>Pax Augusta</em> of the Romans. But it is now certain that the <em>Pax</em> of the Roman period is the city of <a href="../cathen/02393a.htm">Beja</a>, in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, not far from Badajoz, and that the latter name is of Arabic origin. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was erected in 1225, shortly after it was reconquered from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> by King Alfonso IX of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>. Its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Don Pedro Perez, appointed by Alfonso X, the Wise, and from that time it has had an uninterrupted succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which is suffragan to <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, is bounded on the north by the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/04363a.htm">Coria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12157a.htm">Plasencia</a>, and Toledo, on the east by those of Toledo, <a href="../cathen/03793d.htm">Ciudad Real</a>, and Cordova, on the south by the <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Archdiocese of Seville</a>, and on the west by <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. It is composed of 136 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, divided into 13 vicariates, which in ancient times numbered 18, with a proximately half a million <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> has a chapter composed of 5 <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, 13 canons, 16 <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> (formerly called <em>medioracioneros</em>), besides the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> and other personnel <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the proper carrying out of Divine worship. There is a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, under good instructors, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of aspirants to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, also colleges in the city of Badajoz and in Zafra, conducted by the Regular Priests of the Heart of Mary, and several <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities in other cities. The <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> have an establishment at Almendrales; the discalced <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and Sisters of St. Anne at Badajoz, and the Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> elsewhere, making in all 19 communities of <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, besides 3 communities of Sisters of Charity who attend the sick at Badajoz, Zafra, and Frenegal de la Sierra. There are <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for primary and religious instruction in all the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> territory of Badajoz comprises almost all of the civil province of the same name, which lies between the meridians 4&#176; 30' 12" and 7&#176; 9' west of Greenwich, and between 37&#176; 90' and 39&#176; 30' north latitude, with an area of 7,143 square miles. Several rivers, among them the famous Guadiana (the <em>Flumen Anas</em> of the ancients), flow through this province, and the Madrid-Caceres-Lisbon railroad traverses it. All of this district is very fertile, and yields all kinds of cereals, wine, and oil, also cork, the manufacture of which is practically the only industry of this section. The climate is hot and unhealthy, intermittent and infectious fevers being very prevalent. This part of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was first inhabited by the Vettones and Veturi, descendants of the Celts, and was called Vettonia. When the Romans divided Farther <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (<em>Hispania Ulterior</em>) into various provinces, Badajoz was made a part of the province of Lusitania, whose capital, M&eacute;rida (<em>Emerita Augusta</em>), became at the same time the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> obtained possession of this territory, M&eacute;rida was annexed to the Emirate of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, and ceased to be a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. The city of <a href="../cathen/10202a.htm">M&eacute;rida</a> is now included in the Diocese of Badajoz. The Kings of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a> and Castile reconquered this section and gave to the part which is now Badajoz and Caceres the name of Estremadura (<em>Extrema Durii</em>), meaning the region on the opposite side of the River Douro, which had for long time been the dividing line between <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s</a>, the conqueror of Mexico, was a native of Medellin in the Province and Bishopric of Badajoz. Massona, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10202a.htm">M&eacute;rida</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a> (Paulus Diaconus Emeritensis) may also be mentioned among the distinguished natives of this district; of whom the former took part in the Councils of Toledo, and the latter is known as the author of "De vit&acirc; et Miraculis Patrum Emeritensium."
