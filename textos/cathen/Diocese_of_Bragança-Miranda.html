<h1>Diocese of Bragan&ccedil;a-Miranda</h1>  

<p>(Brigantiensis.)

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is situated in the northeastern part of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, in the civil province of Tras-os-Montes, and lies between 2&#176; and 3&#176; 3' of longitude west of the meridian of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 41&#176; 20' and 42&#176; of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/02018d.htm">Astorga</a> and Orense, on the east by those of Salamanca and Zamora, on the south by that of <a href="../cathen/08761b.htm">Lamego</a>, and on the west by the <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Archdiocese of Braga</a>. The civil province is bounded on the north and east by the frontier of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> comprising portions of the Provinces of Salamanca, <a href="../cathen/15747c.htm">Zamora</a>, <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11295b.htm">Orense</a>. The greater part of the territory of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is undulating and mountainous and is traversed by several rivers, which, rising in the Sierras de Sanabria and the Sierra Seca y Segundera, flow from north to south, emptying finally into the river Duero. The climate in general is cold especially in the mountainous region. The southern part and the banks of some rivers and the level tracts of land, such as the one in which Bragan&ccedil;a is situated are fertile, but the rest is unproductive of cereals, although there are broad tracts of land that pasture large herds of cattle which supply a great part of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> with meat.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is comparatively modern. It was erected by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> in the town of Miranda bordering on <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, its territory being taken from the <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Archdiocese of Braga</a>, but <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> in 1770 transferred it to Bragan&ccedil;a, from which the name Bragan&ccedil;a-Miranda is derived. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>. The city of Bragan&ccedil;a, which is the capital of the province of Tras-os-Montes, is situated in a delightful valley near the confluence of the rivers Pervenza and Sabor. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to the Annunciation, is one of the prominent buildings of the city. It has a very large chapter composed of the dean, nine canons, including the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, six <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, eight <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, and six <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. The episcopal household receives 1,166 florins from the Government for its support. The episcopal palace and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of students for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> are large and spacious. Besides the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> there is another church which has collegiate rank, and throughout the diocese there are <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and classes for instruction in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>. There is a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and a <em>Monte de piedad</em>, and before the secularization there were three <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, one of men and two of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The city of Bragan&ccedil;a is fortified, having a citadel or small fortress for its defence. The reigning house of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> is descended from the Dukes of Bragan&ccedil;a and has occupied the throne of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> since the separation of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in the time of Philip IV.
