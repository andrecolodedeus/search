<h1>Diocese of Brixen</h1>  

<p>A Prince-Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, embracing the greater part of Northern Tyrol (with the exception of the part east of the Zillerbach, which belongs to Salzburg), as well as all Vorarlberg, and containing c. 6,705 square miles, and over 440,000 inhabitants.
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Brixen is the continuation of that of Saben (Sabiona), which, according to legend, was founded by St. Cassian. As early as the third century <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> penetrated Sabiona, at that time a Roman custom station of considerable commercial importance. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saben vouched for by history is Ingenuin, mentioned about 580, who appears as suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. The tribes who pushed into the territory of the present Diocese of Brixen, during the great migratory movements, especially the Bajuvari and Langobardi, accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; only the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of the Puster valley (Pustertal) persisted in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> until the eighth century. In the second half of the tenth century Bishop Rihpert (appointed 967) or Bishop Albuin I (967-1005) had the seat of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which since 798 has been under the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, transferred to Brixen, Bishop Hartwig (1020-39) raised Brixen to the rank of a city, and surrounded it with fortifications. The diocese received many grants from the German emperors: thus from Conrad II in 1027 the Norital, from Henry IV in 1091 the Pustertal. In 1179 <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick I</a> conferred on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the title and dignity of a prince of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. This accounts for the fact that during the difficulties between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the empire, the Bishops of Brixen generally took the part of the emperors; particularly <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> is the case of Altwin, during whose episcopate (1049-91) the ill-famed pseudo-synod of 1080 was held in Brixen, at which thirty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, partisans of the emperor, declared <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a> deposed, and set up as <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> the <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Bishop of Ravenna</a>.

<p>The temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> soon suffered a marked diminution through the action of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves who bestowed large sections of their territory in fief on temporal lords, as for example, in the eleventh century courtships in the Inntal and the Eisacktal granted to the Counts of Tyrol, and in 1165 territory in the Inntal and the Pustertal to the Counts of Andechs-Meran. The Counts of Tyrol, in particular, who had fallen heir in large part to the territories of the Count of Meran, constantly grew in power; Bishop Bruno (1249-88) had difficulty in asserting his authority over a section of his territory against the claims of Count Meinhard of Tyrol. Likewise Duke Frederick IV, who was called the Penniless, compelled the Bishops of Brixen to acknowledge his authority. The dissensions between <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a> (1450-64), appointed by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas V</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Brixen, and Archduke Sigmund were also unfortunate; the cardinal was made a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and although the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> placed the diocese under an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, Sigmund came out victor in the struggle.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was proclaimed in the Diocese of Brixen during the episcopate of Christoph I von Schrofenstein (1509-21) by German emissaries, like Strauss, Urban Regius, and others. In 1525, under Bishop Georg III of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1525-39), a peasants' uprising broke out in the vicinity of Brixen, and several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and strongholds were destroyed. The promise of King Ferdinand I, civil ruler of Tyrol, to redress the grievances of the peasants restored tranquility, and at a diet held at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, the most important demands of the peasants were acceded to. Although in 1532 these promises were withdrawn, peace remained undisturbed. Ferdinand I and his son Archduke Ferdinand II, in particular, as civil rulers took active measures against the adherents of the new teachings, chiefly the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>, who had been secretly propagating their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; thus they preserved religious unity in the district of Tyrol and the Diocese of Brixen. At this time important services were rendered in safeguarding the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>. Chief among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the period were: Cardinal Andreas of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1591-1600), and Christoph IV von Spaur (1601-13), who in 1607 founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students; enlarged the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and distinguished himself as a great benefactor of the poor and sick. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw a great reawakening of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the Diocese of Brixen; many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded, new missions for the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> established, and the religious instruction of the people greatly promoted; in 1677 the <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">University of Innsbruck</a> was founded. The most prominent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this period were: Kaspar Ignaz, Count von Kunigl (1702-47), who founded many <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> for the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, made <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> visitations, kept a strict watch over the discipline and moral purity of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, introduced missions under <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, etc.; Leopold, Count von Spaur (1747-78), who rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, completed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and enjoyed the high esteem of <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Empress Maria Theresa</a>; Joseph Philipp, Count von Spaur (1780-91), a friend of learning, who, however, in his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy, leaned towards Josephinism. The Government of Emperor Joseph dealt roughly with church interests; about twenty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were suppressed, a general <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was opened at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> and processions were forbidden.

<p>It was Bishop Franz Karl, Count von Lodron (1791-1828), who was to see the collapse of the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1803 the principality was secularized, and annexed to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter dissolved. During the brief rule of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> the greatest despotism was exercised towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the restoration of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> supremacy (1814) improved conditions for the diocese. By the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> "Ex imposito" (2 May, 1818) a new circumscription was given to the diocese which in this way received a considerable increase in territory; Vorarlberg, in particular, which had previously been divided among the three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/03743b.htm">Chur</a>, <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and Augsburg, was added to the Diocese of Brixen. Vorarlberg was, as a matter of fact, to form a separate diocese, with Feldkirch as see, but this plan has never been put into execution; Vorarlberg is now administered by a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> residing at Feldkirch, who, as a rule, is the <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> of Brixen. In 1825 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was reestablished. All during the nineteenth century the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was occupied by distinguished men who safeguarded the unity of the Faith in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as is instanced in the enforced removal in 1830 of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the Zillertal, who actively championed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and by missions and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> visitations, and by the introduction of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders endeavored, with success, to raise the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of their diocese to a higher level. Karl Franz was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/06371b.htm">Bernhard Galura</a> (1828-56), Vincenz Gasser (1856-79), Johann IX von Leiss, Laimburg (1879-84), Simon Aichner (1884-1904), who resigned 5 March, 1904, and Joseph Altenweisel (1904).
