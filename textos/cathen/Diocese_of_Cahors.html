<h1>Diocese of Cahors</h1>  

<p>(Cadurcensis.)

<p>Comprising the entire department of Lot, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In the beginning it was a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> and later, from 1676 to the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, of <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Albi</a>. From 1802 to 1822 Cahors was under the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and combined the former <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Diocese of Rodez</a> with a great part of the former Dioceses of Vabres and <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>. However, in 1822 it was restored almost to its pristine limits and again made suffragan to Albi. According to a tradition connected with the legend of <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">LIMOGES</a>), this <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, deputed by St. Peter, came to Cahors in the first century and there dedicated a church to St. Stephen, while his disciple, St. Amadour (Amator), the Zaccheus of the Gospel and husband of St. Veronica (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">BORDEAUX</a>), evangelized the diocese. In the seventeenth century these traditions were closely examined by the Abb&eacute; de Fouillac, a friend of <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, and, according to him, the bones discovered at <a href="../cathen/13100a.htm">Rocamadour</a> in 1166, and looked upon as the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Zaccheus, were in reality the bones of St. Amator, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Auxerre. A legend written about the year 1000 by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Saint-Genou (in the <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Diocese of Bourges</a>) relates that Genitus and his son Genulfus were sent to Gaul by <a href="../cathen/14031c.htm">Pope Sixtus II</a> (257-59), and that Genulfus (Genou) was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cahors. But Abb&eacute; Duchesne repudiates this tardy legend. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cahors is St. Florentius, correspondent of <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a> (end of the fourth century). The Diocese of Cahors counted among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: St. Alithus (fifth century); St. Maurilio and St. Ursinicus (sixth century); St. Rusticus, who was assassinated, his brother, St. Desiderius (Didier), the steward of King Dagobert, and St. Capuanus (seventh century); St. Ambrosius (eighth century); St. Gausbert (end of tenth century); Guillaume de Cavaillon (1208-34), who took part in the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>; Hugues G&eacute;raud (1312-16), implicated in the conspiracy against <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> and sentenced to be burned alive; Bertrand de Cardaillac (1324-64) and B&eacute;gon de Castelnau (1366-87), both of whom contributed so powerfully to free Quercy from English rule; Alessandro Farnese (1554-57), nephew of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a>; the Venerable Alain de Solminihac (1636-59), one of the most active reformers of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the seventeenth century, and <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Louis-Antoine de Noailles</a> (1679-80), subsequently <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The city of Cahors, visited by <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Pope Callistus II</a> (1119-24), was the birthplace of Jacques d'Euse (1244-1334), who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1316 under the title of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, and the tower of whose palace is still to be seen in Cahors. He built a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> there, its law faculty being so celebrated as to boast at times of 1200 pupils. <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> studied at this institution, which, in 1751, was annexed to the University of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. In the sixteenth century the Diocese of Cahors was severely tried by religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and the P&eacute;legry College, which gratuitously sheltered a certain number of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> students, became noted for the admirable way in which these young men defended Cahors against the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Cahors, built at the end of the eleventh and restored in the fourteenth century, has a beautiful Gothic <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. When, in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> officiated in this church they had the privilege, as barons and counts of Cahors, of depositing their sword and armour on the altar. In the diocese special homage is paid to St. Sacerdos, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, and his mother, Mundana (seventh century); Esperie (Speria), virgin and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (eighth century); St. G&eacute;raud, Count of Aurillac (beginning of the eleventh century); Blessed Christopher, companion of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> and founder of a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Cahors in 1216, and Blessed Jean-Gabriel Perboyre, born in the village of Mongesty, 1802, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, 1840. The city of Figeac owed its origin to a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> founded by Pepin in 755. The principal places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: Notre-Dame de Rocamadour, visited by St. Louis (1245), Charles the Fair (1324), and Louis XI (1463), its bell being said to have rung <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> several times to announce the deliverance of shipwrecked sufferers who had commended themselves to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>; Notre-Dame de F&eacute;lines and Notre-Dame de Verdale, both dating back to the eleventh century; Saint-Hilaire Lalbenque, where some highly-prized <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/02442a.htm">St. Benedict Joseph Labre</a> are preserved. Prior to the enforcement of the Law of 1901 there were both <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> and <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> in the Diocese of Cahors. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are in charge of four important local orders of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>: the <a href="../cathen/08374a.htm">Daughters of Jesus</a>, numbering 800 (founded in 1820, with mother-house at Vaylats); the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, having a membership of 200 (founded in 1814, with mother-house at Monteng); the Sisters of Our Lady of Calvary, 1000 in number (founded in 1833, with mother-house at Gramat); and the Sisters of Saint-Joseph, numbering 150 (mother house at Sainte-Colombe). A <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> composed of 8 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> missionaries is stationed at <a href="../cathen/13100a.htm">Rocamadour</a>. The "Revue Catholique des Eglises" has recently begun an investigation of all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and although little has yet been done, this investigation has been completed in the Diocese of Cahors, and shows that, out of 85,000 men and 90,000 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 60,000 men and over 80,000 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> make their <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>; and here we would incidentally remark that, despite this favourable condition, the deputies and senators elected by the department vote for all anti-religious <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. In 1900 the Diocese of Cahors had the following religious institutions: 16 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, 6 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 4 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 house of shelter, 10 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and asylums, 1 insane asylum, and 12 houses for religious nurses. In 1905 (at the close of the period under the Concordat) the population was 226,720, with 33 pastorates, 448 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (mission churches), and 55 curacies supported by the State.
