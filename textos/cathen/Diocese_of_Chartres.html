<h1>Diocese of Chartres</h1>  

<p>Comprises the department of Eure-et-Loir. Dismembered by the formation of the new <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Diocese of Blois</a>, in 1697, it was suppressed in 1802, the entire department of Eure-et-Loir being placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the new Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>. However, in 1822, the See of Chartres was re-established and made suffragan to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The catalogue of the church of Chartres gives as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Adventus, Optatus, and Valentinus, the last-named being contemporary with St. Martin. According to the Abb&eacute; Duchesne the Bishopric of Chartres may thus be traced back to the time of Constantine. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the church of Chartres claims: Saints Martinus Candidus and Anianus (fifth century); St Solennis, instrumental in the conversion of <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a>; St. Adventinus, present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 511; St. Leobinus, at the Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 549; St Chaletricus at the Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> in 567; St. Boetharius (about 594), <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Clotaire II and, for a while the captive of Thierry, King of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; <a href="../cathen/06312a.htm">Fulbert</a> (1007-1029), professor and poet, whose name is identified with the history of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">St. Yves</a> (1090-1115), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Saint-Quentin-de-Beauvais, noted as an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer and canonist, and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for two years by King Philip I for having opposed the repudiation of Queen <a href="../cathen/02519a.htm">Bertha</a>; <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> (1176-1180), an illustrious writer, former secretary to <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas Becket</a> and <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>; <a href="../cathen/06624a.htm">Godet de Marais</a> (1690-1709), a writer and the arch enemy of <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietism</a>, also co-operator with <a href="../cathen/09548b.htm">Madame de Maintenon</a> in the founding of Saint-Cyr; the future Cardinal de Latil (1821-1824), at first <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Comte d'Artois and subsequently <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>; Monseigneur Clausel de Montals (1824-1853), ardently attached to Gallican <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and noted for his opposition to the Abb&eacute; Chatel's <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> "French Church", and for his efforts in favor of freedom of instruction..

<p>Special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is paid to St. Arnulphus (Arnoul), assassinated in the forest of Yveline about 534; to <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a> (Avit) who, in the beginning of the sixth century, founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Ch&acirc;teaudun; to St. Laumer (d. 593), founder and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Saint-Martin de-Dreux, and to Blessed Bernard (end of the eleventh century), founder and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Tiron. The mystic Arnaud (twelfth century), author of the "Trait&eacute; de l'oeuvre des six jours" and biographer of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, and Fran&ccedil;ois-Auguste de Thou, beheaded for political reasons under <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, were both Abbots of Bonneval in the Diocese of Chartres; Philippe Desportes, poet (1546-1606), and the Abb&eacute; de Saint Pierre (1658-1743), author of the famous "Projet de paix perp&eacute;tuelle", were Abbots of Tiron. Among the natives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> may be mentioned: Godeau, the poet, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vence (1605-1672). known at the H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet as "Julie's dwarf" and also J.-B. Thiers (1636-1703), <em>cur&eacute;</em> of Champrond, noted for his disagreements with the Chapter of Chartres and his history of wigs (Histoire des perruques).

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/04783a.htm">Didron</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01688a.htm">archeologist</a>, the Chartres <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is "the most curious monument in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, perhaps even in all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; a unique monument."

<p>"If elsewhere may be found more beautiful parts," said the <a href="../cathen/01688a.htm">archeologist</a> Visconti, "nowhere else is there a more beautiful whole." The substructure of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> encloses a well and a vault around which cluster traditions of the origin of the church. The early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the place, it was said, found here an altar surmounted by a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> representing a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> seated with her child upon her knees &#151; both the altar and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, "Virgini paritur," had been erected by the Druids. About the year 67 Saints Altinus and Eodaldus, sent from <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> by Saints Savinianus and Potentianus, built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> over this grotto, where, during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> the virgin Modesta, daughter of the governor, Quirinus, was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>, and her body flung into the well. Whatever may be held as to the time in which Saints Savinianus and Protentianus lived, it would seem that the foundation of the primitive church of Chartres, all that now can be seen, was laid in the days of Constantius Chlorus (beginning of the fourth century). The church was several times destroyed by fire. About 1020 <a href="../cathen/06312a.htm">Bishop Fulbert</a> invited all the sovereigns of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to contribute towards the rebuilding of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, but three more fires (1030-1134-1194) interfered with the progress of the work. However, in 1220, Guillaume le Breton could write: "entirely rebuilt in dressed stone and terminating in a vault that may be compared to the shell of a tortoise, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Chartres need fear nothing further from temporal fire until the Day of Judgment."

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> enthusiasm of which Notre-Dame of Chartres was then the object is attested by the "Po&egrave;me des Miracles" (1210), recently published by Antoine* Thomas, and by Jean le Marchand's poem of 1262. The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> occurred in 1260, and St. Louis is supposed to have attended the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> <a href="../cathen/15653b.htm">windows</a> date back to the thirteenth century, and are the finest in the world &#151; they contain 3889 figures. The upper windows were presented by St. Louis, and St. Ferdinand and Queen Blanche of Castile. The <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porches</a> and windows represent in magnificent symbolism the glorification of Mary. The choir enclosure with its beautifully sculptured groups dates from the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who came to Chartres history mentions St. Louis who, in order to reach there, travelled seven leagues on foot; <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>; Charles the Fair; Philip of Valois; John the Good who went there three times and left his pilgrim's staff, which has become the <em>b&acirc;ton cantoral</em> of the Chapter; Charles V (of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>) who went thither twice barefooted; Louis XI; Henry III who made eighteen <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>; Henry IV who was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> there 27 February, 1594; <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and Popes <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pascal II</a>, <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>. The object of this yet very popular <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> is threefold: to venerate <ul> <li>the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Notre-Dame-sous-Terre, inaugurated in 1857, and modelled after the old <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> burned in 1793, being therefore a reproduction of the figure <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the Druids. Devotions are held in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> which is the largest in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; <li>the "Vierge Noire de Notre-Dame-du Pilier" (Black Virgin) in the upper church; <li>the "Voile de la Vierge" (Veil of the Blessed Virgin), given to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> by Constantine Porphyrogenitus and Irene, transferred about 876 by Charles the Bald from <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> to Chartres, and raised as a standard in 911 by Gantelme, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to put to flight the Norman Rollo. In 1360 <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III of England</a>, and in 1591 Henry Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, passed reverently beneath the <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> containing this veil, which, until the end of the eighteenth century, was considered a chemise, and "chemisettes", emblematic of this veil, were worn on the breast. </ul> The church of Saint-Pierre of Chartres of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries has some very beautiful fourteenth-century windows; it was dependent upon a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> founded in the sixth century.

<p>Several local congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> take charge of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the sick: the sisters of Providence (founded in Chartres, 1654); the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres</a> (founded 1690), who have 123 establishments in the French colonies and others in the countries of the extreme East; the Sisters of the Bon-Secours (founded 1736); the sisters of the Immaculate Conception of Nogent-le-Rotrou (founded 1808), and the Sisters of Our Lady of Chartres (founded 1853). In 1900 the diocese had the following religious institutions: 1 <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling asylum</a>, 17 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for deaf-mutes, 17 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 21 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and hospices, and 2 houses of religious nurses. At the end of 1905 (the close of the Concordat period) the population was 275,433 and there were 25 pastorates, 351 succursals, or second-class <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 15 curacies then remunerated by the State.
