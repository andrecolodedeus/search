<h1>Diocese of Clermont</h1>  

<p>(CLERMONT-FERRAND; CLAROMONTENSIS)

<p>Comprises the entire department of Puy-de-D&ocirc;me and is a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. Although at first very extensive, in 1317 the diocese lost Haute-Auvergne through the creation of the Diocese of Saint Flourandin 1822 the Bourbonnais, on account of the erection of the <a href="../cathen/10603b.htm">Diocese of Moulins</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Clermont was <a href="../cathen/02121a.htm">St. Austremonius</a> (Stramonius). (See <a href="../cathen/02121a.htm">AUSTREMONIUS</a>.) According to local tradition he was one of the seventy-two Disciples of Christ, by birth a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, who came with St. Peter from Palestine to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and subsequently became the Apostle of Auvergne, Berry, Nivernais, and Limousin. At Clermont he is said to have converted the senator Cassius and the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Victorinus, to have sent St. Sirenatus (Cerneuf) to Thiers, St. Marius to Salers, Sts. Nectarius and Antoninus into other parts of Auvergne, and to have been beheaded in 92. This tradition is based on a life of St. Anstremonius written in the tenth century in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mozat, where the body of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> had rested from 761, and rewritten by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Issoire, who retained the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> head. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, born in Auvergne in 544 and well versed in the history of that country, looks upon Austremonius as one of the seven envoys who, about 250, evangelized Gaul; he relates how the body of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was first <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at Issoire, being there the object of great veneration.

<p>Clermont counted amongst its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> a large number of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as St. Urbicus (c. 312); St. Leoguntius; St. Illidius (Allyre), who, about 385, cured the daughter of the Emperor Maximus at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> name was given to the petrifying springs of Clermont, and his life was written by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>; St. Nepotianus (died 388); St. Artemius (died about 394); St. Venerandus (Veau, died about 423); St. Rusticus (424-46); St. Namatius (446-62), founder of the Clermont <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, where he deposited the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/15486b.htm">Sts. Vitalis and Agricola</a> brought from Bologna; Sidonius Apollinaris (470-79), the celebrated <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writer who brought to Clermont the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> St. Amabilis; St. Aprunculus (died about 491); St. Euphrasius (491-515); St. Quintianus (died about 527), whose life was written by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>; St. Gallus (527-51), of whom <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> was the biographer and nephew; <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a> (second half of the sixth century), founder of Notre Dame du Port; St. C&aelig;sarius (c. 627); St. Gallus II (c. 650); St. Genesius (c. 660); St. Pr&aelig;jectus (Prix), historian of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Clermont and assassinated at Volvic 25 January, 676; <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a> II (676-91); St. Bonitus, intimate friend of Sigebert II (end of seventh century); St. Stabilis (823-60). and St. Sigo (866). Among the Bishops of Clermont should also be mentioned: Pierre de Cros (1301-04), engaged by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> to complete his "Summa"; Etienne d'Albert (1340-42), later <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Pope Innocent VI</a> (1352-62); Guillaume du Prat (1528-60), founder of the Clermont College at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and delegate of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; and <a href="../cathen/10034a.htm">Massillon</a>, the illustrious orator (1717-42). The Diocese of Clermont can likewise claim a number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> honours as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, viz: St. Calevisus (Calais, 460-541), a pupil in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Menat near Riom, whence he retired to <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, where he founded the Abbey of Anisole; St. Maztius (died 527), founder at Royat near Clermont of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which became later a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>; St. Portianus (sixth century), founder of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to which the city of Saint-Pour&ccedil;ain (Allier) owes its origin; St. Etienne de Muret (1046-1124), son of the Viscount of Thiers and founder of the Order of Grandmont in Limousin, and St. Peter the Venerable (1092-1156), of the Montboissier <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Auvergue, noted as a writer and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny.

<p>Several famous <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> were natives of Clermont: <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Blaise Pascal</a>, author of the "Pens&eacute;es" (1623-62); the Arnauld <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and Soanen (1647-1740), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Senez, famous for his stubborn opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>. On the other hand the city of Riom was the birthplace of <a href="../cathen/14027c.htm">Sirmond</a>, the learned <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> (1559-1651), confessor to Louis XIII and editor of the ancient councils of Gaul. Other natives worthy of mention in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> were the Abb&eacute; Delille, poet (1738-1813), and Montlosier, the publicist (1755-1838), famous for his memoir against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and to whom Bishop Ferou refused <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> burial. <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a> came to Clermont in 1095 to preside at the organization of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>; <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pope Paschal II</a> visited the city in 1106, <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> in 1120, <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> in 1130, <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> in 1164, and, in 1166, <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas Becket</a>. It was also at Clermont that, in 1262, in presence of St. Louis, the marriage of Philip the Bold and Isabella of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> was solemnized. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Clermont, dating from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, is not of equal arch&aelig;ological importance with the church of Notre-Dame du Port, which stands today as it was rebuilt in the eleventh century, and is one of the most beautiful of Romanesque churches in the Auvergnese style. One of the capitals in Notre-Dame du Port, ascribed to the eleventh century, is among the most ancient sculptured representations of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin. This <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is much frequented as a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, as are also Notre Dame d'Orcival and Notre Dame de Vassivi&egrave;re at Besse. The "dry mass" (without Consecration or Communion) was celebrated in the Diocese of Clermont as late as the seventeenth century.

<p>Before the Law of 1901 was carried into effect, there were in the Diocese: <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, Fathers of the African Missions, <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>. Several local congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are engaged in teaching, among them being the religious of Notre-Dame de Clermont, founded in 1835, with mother-house at Chamali&egrave;res; the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of the Good Shepherd, founded by <a href="../cathen/10034a.htm">Massillon</a> in 1723, with mother-house at Clermont; the Sisters of the Heart of the Infant Jesus, mother-house at Lezoux; and the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, founded in 1806, with mother-house at Billom. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has the following religious institutions: 2 maternity <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 40 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the blind, 4 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for deaf mutes, 3 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 16 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 2 houses of refuge and of protection, 23 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and hospices, 35 houses for nursing sisters, and 1 insane asylum. Statistics for the end of 1905 (the close of the period under the Concordat) show a population of 529,181, with 54 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 447 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (mission churches), and 175 curacies remunerated by the State.
