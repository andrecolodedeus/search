<h1>Diocese of Cochin</h1>  

<p>(COCHINENSIS) on the Malabar coast, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was erected and constituted a suffragan of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, of which it had previously formed a part, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Pro excellenti praeeminentia" of <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, 4 February, 1558 (cf. Bullarium Patronatus Portugalliae Regum, I, 193). It was later reorganized according to the Concordat of 23 June, 1886, between <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and King Luiz of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and the Constitution "Humanae Salutis Auctor" of the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 1 September, 1886. It is suffragan to the patriarchal See of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> (cf. Julio Biker, Collec&ccedil;ao de Tractados, XIV, 112-437). The diocese consists of two strips of territory along the sea-coast, the first about fifty miles long, by eight in its broadest part, the second thirty miles in length. There are two important towns, Cochin and Alleppi (Alapalli) in which the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are situated.
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> professed in Malabar at the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> were: <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hinduism</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> (the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Christians of St. Thomas</a> or <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>), <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, the last represented by a large colony of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. From these the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community was recruited, mostly from the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>. <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> also contributed a fair share, especially when <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> was supreme on this coast; among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> conversions were rare. To <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> belongs the glory of having begun regular <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionary work in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and Cochin has the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being the cradle of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The first missionaries to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> were eight <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, who set sail from <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> on the fleet of <a href="../cathen/03128a.htm">Pedro Alvarez Cabral</a>, 9 March, 1500: Father Henrique de Coimbra, Superior; Fathers Gaspar, Francisco da Cruz, Simao de Guimaraens, Luiz do Salvador, Masseu, Pedro Netto, and Brother Jo&atilde;o da Vitoria. Three of them were slain at Calicut in the massacre of 16 November, 1500. The survivors arrived at Cochin on or about the 26th of that month, and settled there (except the superior, who went back with the fleet to obtain more help for the mission), thus laying the foundation of the Diocese of Cochin (Histor. Seraf. Chron. da Ordem de S. Francisco na Provincia de <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, III, 489, 494, 495). They were followed by large contingents of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionaries, who worked from the city of Cochin as a centre. The harvest of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> was rich, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> multiplied along the coast and in the interior, and in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was assigned to them

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Nestorian Christians</a> in the vicinity of Cochin naturally attracted the attention of the missionaries, and Fathers Simao de Guimaraens and Luiz do Salvador were soon occupied in refuting their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and reforming their discipline and customs (Hist. Seraf., III, 497). These two missionaries were the pioneers of the Faith among the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Nestorian Christians</a>. Members of the same order continued this missionary work till the middle of the sixteenth century, when these missions were handed over to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who continued the good work with such earnestness and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> that most of the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Nestorian Christians</a> were converted before 1600. The chief public record of their conversion is to be found in the Proces of the Synod of Diamper (of Udiamperur), held in June, 1599, by Alexio de Menezes, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, Metropolitan and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of the East ("Bull. Patron. Por. reg.", a collection of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and royal documents pertaining to the Portughese missions in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, App. tom. I, 147 sqq.; see also "Subsidium ad Bull. Patr. Por.", Alleppi, 1903). In December, 1502, the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Nestorian or Syrian Christians</a> (they used the Syrian language in their liturgy) presented to <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a>, who had arrived at Cochin, the sceptre of their former kings, and applied to him for assistance against their <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> neighbours. <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Gama</a> formally accepted the sceptre in the name of the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The Syrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of those <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> promised obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries and two <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> accompanied <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Gama</a> to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> <em>en route</em> for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Thus began the protectorate of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> over the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Syrian Christians</a>, a protectorate which lasted for 160 years (cf. Jo&atilde;o de Barras, "Asia", Dec. I, bk. V, ch. viii; also "Historia Serafica"). Till 1542 the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were the only regular missionaries in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, though they had the cooperation of some <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, as Father Pedro Gonsalves, Vicar of Santa Cruz church in the city of Cochin, and father Miguel Vaz, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> preacher of the Faith, as well as of some isolated members of other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, who had come out as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> to the fleets ("Commentarios do Grande Affonso d'Albuquerque", 3d ed., 1774, I, ch. v, 19-20), and "Ethiopia Oriental", II, bk. II, ch. i).

<p>Among the pioneer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Cochin mention should be made of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> Jo&atilde;o d'Elvas and Pedro d'Amarante, who till 1507 preached the Gospel at Vypeen, Palliport, Cranganore, and other important places; Father Manuel de S. Mathias with his eleven companions, who laboured for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> at Porroead, <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a>, Trivellam, and elsewhere. Father Vincent de Lagos, who in 1540 established the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Cranganore to train the <a href="../cathen/14678a.htm">Nestorian Christians</a> in the purity of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> highly praised by <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, and the first built in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. In 1542 it had eighty students (Amado, Hist. da Egreja em <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> e colonias, Vol. VII, pt. II, 117-21).



<p>After <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> arrival in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, 6 May, 1542, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> quickly spread over <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and the members were always most successful in the missions under their charge. St. Francis often visited Cochin, where the citizens gave him the church of Madre de Deus, and asked him to establish in the city a residence of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. It was accordingly founded by Father Balthazar Gago, S.J., in 1550. In the same year Father Nicolao Lancelot, S.J., built the residence and college of <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a>, and Affonso Cipriano, S.J., the residence of Mylapore, soon after the residence and college of Punicail were established, and the residence of Manar. In 1560 the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> built for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Cochin, and in 1562 a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was established there. In 1601 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Province of Malabar was founded, and Cochin was made the residence of the provincial. Among the early <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> must be mentioned in addition to <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, foremost of missionaries, Fathers Mansilha, Criminal, B. Nunes, H. Henriques, F. Peres, F. Rodrigues; Brothers Adam Francisco, N. Nunes. Later, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Augustinians, and other orders followed the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> built their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and college at Cochin in 1553; some years later their example was followed by the Augustinians, and still later by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. Cochin thus became the stronghold of the Faith, and it was the missionaries of Cochin who carried the Gospel throughout all Southern <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and Ceylon, everywhere establishing missions, and building churches, charitable and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>, all of which were endowed by the kings of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>.

<p>Apart from the heroic <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the most powerful element in the propagation of the Faith was the protection the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> Government always accorded to the converts. It provided them with good situations, employing them in civil offices, freed them the molestations of their masters, elevated them in the social scale, exempted them from the operation of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> law, appointed for them a judicial tribunal composed of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, which in rural districts was presided over by the local <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. It induced the rajahs to treat the converts kindly, and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> them to allow their converted subjects all the civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, e.g. of inheritance, which their <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> relatives enjoyed. ("Collec&ccedil;aode Tractados", treaties made with the rajahs of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and East Africa, <em>passim</em> in the first thirteen vols; also "Archivo Portuguez Oriental" Nova <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, 1861, Fasc. III, parts I and II <em>passim</em>; "Oriente Conquistado", Bombay reprint, 1881, I, II, <a href="../cathen/08324a.htm">P. Jarric, S.J.</a>, "Thesaurus Rerum Indicarum", Cologne, 1615, I, III, on the Malabar Missions of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>.)

<p>The above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was constituted, raised the collegiate church of the Holy Cross (Santa Cruz), the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Cochin, to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and established therein a chapter consisting of five dignitaries and twelve canons. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gave the patronage of the new diocese and see to the kings of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Patr. Port. Reg., I, 194).

<p>Until 1506 <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> law, which was rigorously observed, forbade the use of lime and stone in other constructions than <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>. Hence the early Portuguese, to avoid displeasing the rajah, built their houses of wood. Finally the viceroy, Francisco de Almeida, induced the Rajah of Cochin to permit him the use of lime and stone, and on 3 May, 1506, the first stone for the fortress and city was laid by the viceroy with great pomp. It was the feast of the Finding of the Holy Cross, which thus became the patronal feast of the city, and gave to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church its title. The church of the Holy Cross (Santa Cruz) was begun in, or rather before, 1506, for in 1505 we find Portuguese soldiers contributing towards the construction of the church of Cochin 1000 xerafins (about $150 a large sum four hundred years ago), the result of an auction of the rich booty of a naval combat (Gaspar Correa, "Lendas da India", I, 522; II, 182). Some years later this church was raised to collegiate rank, endowed by the king, and provided with a vicar and six <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. It was a magnificent buildings the mother church of the ancient Diocese of Cochin, which the Malabar, Coromandel and Fishery boasts, and Ceylon once obeyed and under whose teaching and discipline they flourished. There are now not less than eleven <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in the territory of the original Diocese of Cochin. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cochin was <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Father Jorge Tremudo, an illustrious missionary on this coast. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Pastoralis officii cura nos admonet" of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, 13 Dec., 1572, permitted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cochin, on occasion of the vacancy of the See of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, to take possession of that see and administer it till the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> provided for the vacancy. This is why many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cochin were appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>.

<p>In 1577 Brother Jo&atilde;o Gonsalves, S.J., engraved at Cochin, for the first time, the Malealam type, from which was printed the first Malealam book, "Outlines of Christian Doctrine", written in Portuguese by <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> for the use of children. In 1578 Fr. Jo&atilde;o de Faria, S.J., engraved at Punicail the Tamil type, with which the "Flos Sanctorum" was printed in Tamil for the Fishery Coast (Paulinus a S. Bartholomaeo, "India Orient. Christiana" <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1794, 179 sqq.; "Oriente Conquistado", Vol. I, Pt. I, Cong. I, Div. I, section 23).

<p>Cochin was taken, 6 Jan. 1663, by the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, after a siege of six months. The city was reduced in size; the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were expelled; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and colleges, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace and 2 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 13 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, were razed to the ground. The church of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was spared by the conquerors and converted to their <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> use. When the English expelled the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, 20 October, 1795, they kept this church for the same purpose; it stands today a witness to the events of the past four centuries, and is considered the oldest existing church in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The magnificent <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was turned by the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> into a warehouse for merchandise. In 1806 it was blown up by the English.

<p>From 1663 until the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was reorganized in 1886, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Cochin resided at <a href="../cathen/12610a.htm">Quilon</a>. In 1896 work was begun on the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of the Holy Cross of Cochin by Bishop Ferreira amid great <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. In April, 1897, when almost complete, the building collapsed, entailing a heavy loss. Bishop Ferreira died at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, 4 May, the same year. Bishop Oliveira Xavier took charge of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in March, 1898, removed the debris of the fallen building and successfully carried the work to completion. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was opened for Divine Worship, 9 August, 1903. Brother Moscheni, the famous <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> mission of <a href="../cathen/09588b.htm">Mangalore</a>, was secured to decorate the church, but hardly finished the sanctuary when he died, 14 November, 1905. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 19 November, 1905, by Bishop Pereira of Damaum, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> <em>ad honorem</em> of Cranganore.
<h2 id="section2">Religious conditions</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Cochin has suffered some rigorous persecutions. The most severe was that of 1780, commenced by Nagam Pillay, Dewan of Travancore, in which 20,000 converts fled to the mountains, to escape his cruelties, and many died as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Father Jo&atilde;o Falco S.J., was the only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> left to console the sufferers. There were other less severe persecutions in 1787, 1809, and 1829 (Paulinus a S. Bartholomaeo, "India Orient. Christiana", 165 sqq.: also "Church History of Travancore", Madras, 1903, Introduction, 55). In a general way there has always been a kind of mild <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> or animosity on the part of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> Governments and authorities against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The growth of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is at present affected especially by the "Law of Disability" in force in the Native States of Malabar, by which a convert becomes a stranger to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and forfeits all <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of inheritance. The government <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, in which the young are reared in religious indifferentism, form also a remarkable hindrance to conversions, especially among the higher classes.
