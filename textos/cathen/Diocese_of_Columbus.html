<h1>Diocese of Columbus</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of Columbus comprises that part of the <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">State of Ohio</a>, south of 40&#167;41', lying between the Ohio River on the east and the Scioto River on the west, and also the Counties of Delaware, Franklin, and Morrow, twenty-nine counties of the eighty-eight into which the <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">State of Ohio</a> is divided; it contains 13,685 square miles. This portion of the State belonged originally to the <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Diocese of Cincinnati</a>, and was recommended to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for erection as a see by the Fathers of the Second Plenary Council, of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, held in 1866. It was not until 3 March, 1868, that the official documents were issued erecting the diocese and naming as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/13191c.htm">Sylvester Horton Rosecrans</a> who had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> and Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12226a.htm">Pompeiopolis</a>, 25 March, 1862. The portion of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> assigned to this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was in 1868 to a large extent but sparsely populated; no railroad had as yet penetrated some of the counties, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was forced to make many of the journeys on his visitations by stage, wagon, or steamboat. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers were the earliest missionaries in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, locating at St. Joseph's, Perry County, in the early part of the nineteenth century, and from their number was chosen the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, Edward Fenwick. The first place of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> was at St. Joseph's, Perry County. This <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built of logs and was blessed 6 December, 1818, by Rev. Edward Fenwick and his nephew, Rev. N.D. Young, both natives of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and receiving their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> from Bishop Flaget, who was then the only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> between the Alleghenies and the Mississippi. The congregation consisted of ten <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. An <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was built nearby, and its inmates were one American, N.D. Young, one Irishman, Thos. Martin, and one <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a>, Vincent De Rymacher. The second <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> erected in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> was also in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, blessed in 1822, near what is now Danville. Knox County, then known as Sapp's Settlement, a colony from near Cumberland, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, many of its members direct descendants of the colonists of Lord Baltimore. This <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built of logs and was blessed by <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> congregation ministered to by them. Within a few miles of this second <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlement in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> is the college town of Gambier, seat of Kenyon College and the Episcopalian Seminary of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, over which in 1868 presided, before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, Dr. James Kent Stone, afterwards Father Fidelis of the Congregation of <a href="../cathen/11590a.htm">St. Paul of the Cross</a>. From its walls have gone forth many illustrious men who in after-life turned their eyes to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, among them <a href="../cathen/13191c.htm">Bishop Rosecrans</a> and his brother, <a href="../cathen/13191c.htm">General Rosecrans</a>, Henry Richards, father of Rev. James Havens Richards, S.A., and William Richards.

<p>In its early days the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was largely an agricultural district, the first settlers from <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> being tillers of the soil. Later came the emigrants from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who were followed by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their native lands. At the present time mining and manufacturing have so far advanced as to predominate and control. Immigration has also added to the variety of races among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, notably Poles, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarians</a>, Greeks, <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuanians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> may be found among the mining populations of the eastern and southern parts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; while <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a> are numerous among the workmen employed in the manufacture of glass, an industry that has risen of late years to prominence in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, owing to the discovery of natural gas, which is an important feature in this business. The native-born descendants of the pioneer <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have taken a notable place in the walks of business and professional life, especially in the larger centres of population. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and a large number of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are natives of the State. All this has worked a decided change in the attitude of non-Catholics towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> fellow citizens.

<p><a href="../cathen/13191c.htm">Sylvester Horton Rosecrans</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, died 21 October, 1878. He was succeeded by John Ambrose Watterson, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 8 August, 1880, and died 17 April, 1890. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Henry Moeller, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 25 August, 1900, promoted to the Archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/01701a.htm">Areopolis</a> and made Coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, 27 April, 1903. The fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, James Joseph Hartley, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 25 February, 1904.

<p>There are 142 priests--105 secular and 37 regular--in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, with 34 brothers and 450 sisters. The total population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is about 1,000,000; of this number 80,000 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> number 75, with 45 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and 9361 pupils, 4520 boys and 4841 girls. There are two <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, with 460 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>; a Convent of the Good Shepherd with 207 inmates; four <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, treating 4000 patients annually; a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, with 22 students; a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, "The Pontifical College Josephinum of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith", with 161 students; a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, with 100 students; and three academies, with 430 pupils.

<p>The Diocese of Columbus has given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Fitzgerald of <a href="../cathen/09295a.htm">Little Rock</a> and Gallagher of <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>; while the names of Henni, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, Lamy, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Santa F&eacute;, De Goesbriand, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a>, may be found on the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> registers of the early mission churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The State and nation also have received many a notable service, both in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and peace, from sons of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. <a href="../cathen/13757a.htm">General Philip H. Sheridan</a> was in his boyhood a resident of Somerset, Perry Co., the cradle of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. <a href="../cathen/13191c.htm">General W.S. Rosecrans</a>, brother of the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, both converts, General Don Carlos Buell, Generals Hugh and Charles Ewing of the Ewing <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Lancaster; Frank Hunt, Constitutional lawyer, Representative in Congress, and free trade advocate, J. A. MacGahan, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria's</a> liberator, whose remains were brought by the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Government from Constantinople to Perry County, are a few of the names on the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> roll of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.
