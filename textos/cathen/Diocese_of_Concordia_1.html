<h1>Diocese of Concordia</h1>  

<p>(CONCORDIENSIS IN AMERICA.)

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Diocese of Concordia</a> was erected 2 August, 1887, and is situated in the northwestern part of <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>, U.S.A. It is bounded on the west by <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>; on the north, by Nebraska; east, by the east lines of Washington, Riley, Geary, Dickinson; on the south, by the south lines of Dickinson, Saline, Ellsworth, Russell, Ellis, Trego, Gove, Logan, and Wallace Counties. Area, 26,685 sq. miles.

<p>In 1886 the <a href="../cathen/09102b.htm">Diocese of Leavenworth</a>, <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>, was divided into three new sees, <a href="../cathen/09102b.htm">Leavenworth</a>, <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">Wichita</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a>. On 9 August, 1887, the Rev. Richard Scannell of <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Nashville</a>, <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>, was nominated first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a>; and governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> until 30 January, 1891, when he was transferred to Omaha. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">Wichita</a>, <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>, then became administrator of <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a>, and it was not until 1897 that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was again appointed in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Rev. T.J. Butler of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, who died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, however, 17 July, 1897, before receiving episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. On 21 September, 1898, the Very Rev. John F. Cunningham, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09102b.htm">Diocese of Leavenworth</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in that city, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a>. Born in 1842, in the County Kerry, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he made his studies at St. Benedict's College, Atchison, <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>, and at St. Francis' Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/09102b.htm">Leavenworth</a>, 8 August, 1865. After his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> he devoted himself to the multiplication of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and institutions of learning and charity. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a>, a stone structure of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>, dedicated in 1902, took the place of a modest little church erected by the Rev. Louis Mollier in 1874.

<p>In 1884 a boarding-school for young ladies under the supervision of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> was established near the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. It has since moved to the imposing edifice known as the Nazareth Academy. It is the mother-house and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of these sisters, who have branch houses, missions, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, <a href="../cathen/10729b.htm">Nebraska</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, and Missouri. The old academy has been turned into a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Fathers</a>, who settled early in the western part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in and about Victoria, have built many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and have <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Hays City, Munjor, and <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>. They have also worked efficiently among the Russian immigrants of that portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, aided by the Sisters of St. Agnes.

<p>From 1898 to 1907, 45 churches and 20 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were built, exclusive of the opening of many new missions and stations. There are 51 secular and 15 religious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, attending 91 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 30 stations, and 4 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The children in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> number about 2482. Two academies, at <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a> and Abilene, have about 135 pupils. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is 26,125.
