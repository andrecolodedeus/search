<h1>Diocese of Covington</h1>  

<p>(COVINGTONENSIS)

<p>Comprises that part of <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, U. S. A., lying east of the Kentucky River, and of the western limits of Carroll, Owen, Franklin, Woodford, Jessamine, Garrard, Rockcastle, Laurel, and Whitley Counties, an area of 17,286 square miles. It was established 29 July, 1853, by the division of the <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Diocese of Louisville</a>, then embracing the whole <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">State of Kentucky</a>. This portion of the State had been ministered to by a body of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> conspicuous for ability, learning, and devotion to <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. White Sulphur, the first organized congregation in this <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, rejoiced in the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> administration of a <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Kenrick</a>, who in later years graced the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and of a Reynolds, destined to become successor of the great <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Bishop England</a> of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>. Lexington was growing into an important <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> under the watchful guidance of Rev. John McGill, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, Virginia. All of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> manifested in their lives the glorious traditions of Flaget, <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Badin</a>, David, and Nerinckx, whose successors they were. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigration has been almost exclusively confined to two nationalities: German and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>. The former compose a large majority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the cities and towns along the Ohio River, while the latter have sought the interior of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In Covington and Newport German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> predominate, while in Lexington, <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> are in the majority. Lying south of Mason and Dixon's Line, although rich in raw material, the diocese has been handicapped by a lack of industrial and mineral development. Within its confines there is a total population of about 900,000, of whom 54,423 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The attitude of non-Catholics is uniformly respectful, considerate, and kind.
<h2>Bishops</h2>

<ol><li>The choice of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new diocese fell upon the Rev. GEORGE ALOYSIUS CARRELL, S.J., <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> Church, Cincinnati. He was born in Philadelphia, 13 June, 1803, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 20 December, 1827, and entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> 19 August, 1835. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1 November, 1853, at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. The burden resting on the shoulders of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> sparsely settled by 8000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> without influence or material resources, was a heavy one; but at his death (25 Sept., 1868), after fourteen years of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> labours, he left it thoroughly organized with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population three times as great as he found there, a self-sacrificing <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, a devoted people, and many <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and eleemosynary institutions. <li>The second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, AUGUSTUS MARIE TOEBBE, was born 15 January, 1829, at Meppen, <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 14 September, 1854, at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 9 January, 1870, and died 2 May, 1884. He contributed largely to the increase of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the growth of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. <li>CAMILLUS PAUL MAES, his successor, was born in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 13 March, 1846, studied at the American College, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Diocese of Detroit</a>, where he was chancellor when appointed to the See of Covington. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 25 January, 1885, and soon cleared off a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of $150,000. He next undertook to replace the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, rapidly tottering to decay, with a magnificent Gothic pile in the most prominent part of the city. Bishop Maes also found time to care for the remote population dwelling in the mountainous parts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Few people of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were blessed with an abundance of wealth. James Walsh was a conspicuous benefactor, who made possible the first <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and later enabled Bishop Maes to begin the erection of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His son, Nicholas Walsh, followed generously in the footsteps of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. Mrs. Mary Howard Preston, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> convert, gave the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> funds to start the great work of the missions to non-Catholics in Eastern Kentucky.</ol>

<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population (1908) is 54,423 (10,162 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>).
