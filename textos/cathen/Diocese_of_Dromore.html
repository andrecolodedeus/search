<h1>Diocese of Dromore</h1>  

<p>(DROMORENSIS, and in ancient documents DRUMORENSIS)

<p>Dromore is one of the eight suffragans of Armagh, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. It includes portions of the counties of Down, <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, and Antrim, and contains eighteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, of which two, Newry and Clonallon, are mensal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. It takes its name from Dromore (<em>Druim Mor,</em> great ridge), a small town in the northwest of County Down, sixty-three miles north of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, twenty-five miles east of Armagh, and fourteen miles south-west of Belfast, which is built on the same river, the Lagan. The See of Dromore was founded in the sixth century by St. Colman (called also Mocholmoc), one of the many holy men (more than a hundred) bearing that name in the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. From a prophecy said to have been uttered by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, sixty years before, Archbishop Healy ("Life and Writings of St. Patrick", p. 494) infers that <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> claimed no immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> over the territory of Iveagh which forms mainly the Diocese of Dromore, but willed that territory to be reserved for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the native race of Dal-Araide &mdash; namely, St. Colman, who founded his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> there about the year 514, some sixty years after <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> founded the See of Armagh. Dromore has had its own independent <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> ever since. The old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Dromore, which had been taken by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, was burnt down by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> insurgents in 1641, and rebuilt by Bishop Taylor twenty years later; but it has been far surpassed by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church recently erected. The seat of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, however, was transferred some two hundred years ago to Newry, the largest town of County Down, and a place of great historical interest, situated at the head of Carlingford Lough. In this town, when the severity of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">Penal Laws</a> began to relax, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> built in a retired suburb a very plain church which is still in use; but just before Catholic Emancipation an edifice worthy of the name of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun in 1825 and completed by Dr. Michael Blake (1833-1860) who had been <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> and the restorer of the <a href="../cathen/08157a.htm">Irish College</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was greatly enlarged and beautified by Bishop Henry O'Neill, who succeeded Bishop McGivern in 1901.

<p>Under Dr. McGivern's predecessor, Dr. John Pius Leahy, O.P. (1860-1890), a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> was founded on the Armagh side of Newry, and a very handsome church erected. The <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, who went to Newry from Harold's Cross, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, in 1830, were for many years the only <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> north of the Boyne. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Newry in 1855, and have now flourishing establishments in Lurgan, Rostrevor, and Warrenpoint. There is a large <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college at Violet Hill near Newry which is under the patronage of St. Colman. To this <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, besides the church at Dromore already referred to, are also dedicated the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches at Tullylish, Kilvarlin, in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Magheralin, and Barnmeen near Rathfriland in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Drumgath. Few <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> antiquities have survived the ravages of time, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Abbey Yard in Newry marks the site of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> founded in the year 1144 by <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard's</a> friend, <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a> O'Morgair, and endowed in 1157 by Maurice O'Loughlin, King of All <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. It is called in the annals <em>Monasterium de Viridi Ligno</em> &mdash; a name given to Newry from the yew-tree said to have been planted there by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> name being Niubar (and sometimes Newrkintragh, "the yew at the head of the strand") which is latinized <em>Ivorium</em> or <em>Nevoracum,</em> but more commonly as above <em>Viride Lignum.</em> There are the ruins of an old church half a mile east of Hilltown. In the adjoining <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Kilbroney (church of St. Bronach, a virgin saint of the district) half a mile north-east of Rostrevor is a graveyard with the venerable ruins of a church, an ancient stone cross, and a little to the west St. Brigid's well. Imbedded in a tree in this graveyard, a very antique bell was found about a hundred years ago and is now carefully preserved.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dromore was John Tod, on whom it was bestowed <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> in 1606, while he was at the same time <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05147a.htm">Down and Connor</a>. It was an unfortunate beginning; for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historian, Sir James Ware, says Tod was degraded for incontinence and poisoned himself in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Two of his successors distinguished themselves more creditably: Jeremy Taylor, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of these three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> from 1661 to 1667, an eloquent preacher and a writer of genius, and Thomas Percy, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dromore from 1782 to 1811, whose "Reliques of Ancient Poetry" had a great and enduring influence on <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English literature</a>.

<p>There are 18 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 42 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and 53 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at Newry; also 5 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, one of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian Brothers</a> (Newry). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is (1908), 43,014; non-Catholic, 71,187.
