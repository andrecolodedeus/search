<h1>Diocese of Dunkeld</h1>  

<p>(DUNKELDENSIS)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, constituted, as far back as the middle of the ninth century, the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> see of the Columban Church by King Kenneth Mac Alpine, who rebuilt there the church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded by King Constantine (afterwards destroyed by the Danes), and translated thither St. Columba's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. The first occupant of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is styled in the Annals of Ulster (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 865) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Fortrenn, the name by which the kingdom of the Southern Picts was then known. He was also <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Dunkeld, with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, formerly enjoyed by <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, over the other Columban <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The seat of the primacy was, however, subsequently transferred to Abernethy, and then to St. Andrews, and Dunkeld became subject to lay <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, from one of whom, Crinan, sprang Malcolm III and his successors on the throne of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. In 1127 King Alexander, who had already founded the Diocese of Moray farther north, erected Dunkeld into a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> and replaced the Columban <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by a chapter of secular canons. The new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> included a great part of what afterwards became the Dioceses of Argyll and Dunblane, and retained its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over various churches representing old Columban foundations. The Abbots of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> remained, as heretofore, subject to the ancient <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> See of Dunkeld, until <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> became the seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Isles at the end of the fifteenth century. About the same time Dunkeld (together with Dunblane, <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Galloway</a>, and Argyll) became a suffragan of the newly-constituted Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>; but during the primacy of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> Foreman of St. Andrews (1513-1522) it was restored to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> province. Thirty-five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> occupied the See of Dunkeld from its foundation in 1107 until the extinction of the ancient <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in the sixteenth century. Of this line of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> the most distinguished were James Kennedy (1438-1440), illustrious for his birth, learning, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, who was translated, after two years at Dunkeld, to the Bishopric of St. Andrews; the famous poet-prelate <a href="../cathen/05143a.htm">Gavin Douglas</a> (1516-1521), who died in exile in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; and John Hamilton (1545-1547), who succeeded the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> <a href="../cathen/02372a.htm">Cardinal Beaton</a> at St. Andrews, and closed his troubled career on the scaffold at Stirling in 1571. The last pre-Reformation <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dunkeld was Robert Crichton (nephew of a former occupant of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>), who survived until 1586.

<p>For close on three centuries, the Diocese of Dunkeld, like the other Scottish <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, until, on 4 March, 1878, it was restored by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Ex supremo apostolatus apice". The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as then re-constituted, is one of the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">archiepiscopal province</a> of St. Andrews, and includes the counties of Perth, Forfar, Clackmannan, Kinross, and the northern part of Fife. Since the revival of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, it has been held by three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: George Rigg (died 1887); James G. Smith (transferred to St. Andrews in 1900); and the Right Rev. Angus Macfarlane, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1901. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> pro-cathedral is in Dundee, the residence of the great majority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, erected in 1895, consists of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and eight canons. The total number of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> in the diocese (1908) is 35; regulars (<a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>), 12. The missions and chaplaincies number 17, the churches, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and stations 31, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> 15. There are two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of men (<a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> and <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>), four <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (<a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, and Sisters of Charity), and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions comprise a home for aged poor, a house of mercy for servants, and a working girls' home. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is estimated to be rather more than 30,000. The old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Dunkeld, beautifully situated on the Tay amid wooded hills, was erected between 1220 and 1500. The building was much damaged in the reign of Robert II, and suffered later at the hands of the Earl of Buchan, styled the "Wolf of Badenoch". It fell partly into ruins in the sixteenth century, since when the choir has been used for <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> worship. The Dukes of Atholl, long the owners of the building, have spent a good deal on its preservation and repair, and an extensive restoration of the choir was carried out in 1908, chiefly at the cost of Sir Donald Currie. There is now no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church or resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the village of Dunkeld.
