<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Diocese of Galloway</h1>  

<p>(Gallovidiana).

<p>Situated in the southwest of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. It comprises the Counties of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, and Wigtown and about four-fifths of the County of Ayr, thus embracing a territory of 3347 square miles and a general population of 373,670, of which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> form only a small fraction. From an historical point of view, a singular interest attaches to this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> since it is certainly the most ancient <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> foundation in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, its founder and first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/11084a.htm">St. Ninian</a>, being "the first authentic personages that meets us in the succession of Scottish missionaries" (Belleshiem). This illustrious saint, a Briton, born on the Solway shore, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by St. Siricius, founded his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at <em>Whithorn</em> and dedicated his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, in 397; and, having evangelized the country as far north as the Grampian mountains, died about 432. The dates here given are on the authority of the majority of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> writers.

<p>The original title of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was "Whitherne" (Quhitherne), latinized "Witerha" and (more frequently) "Candida Casa", signifying the White House so called, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> tells us, from the structure and appearance of the church erected by <a href="../cathen/11084a.htm">St. Ninian</a> "in a style unusual among the Britons". At what precise date the territorial title of "Galloway" came into use is not quite clear. It is obviously improbable that the area of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was at all defined in <a href="../cathen/11084a.htm">St. Ninian's</a> time, but from the eighth till the end of the sixteenth century it was limited to the district of Galloway, i.e., the two Counties of Kirkeudbright and Wigtown. The succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in this see was three times interrupted in the course of its history for periods averaging three hundred years' duration each. The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the sixteenth century, Andrew Durie, died in 1558, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was vacant three hundred and twenty years.

<p>It was restored, for the third time, by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1878, and the Right Rev. John McLachlan, D.D., <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the Western Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, was appointed the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. From the extent of territory it would be perhaps more accurately described as a new diocese, for it was formed out of two outlying portions of the former eastern and western vicariates and has more than double the are it had at either previous restoration. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, small in number and thinly dispersed over the whole territory, belonged chiefly to the poorer labouring class and, excepting the larger burghs, such as Ayr, Dumfries, and Kilmarnock, was very inadequately provided for in respect of ordinary religious and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> needs. But the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was a man of great energy and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, with a wide missionary and administrative experience, and in a comparatively short time he not only thoroughly organized the diocese but also furnished it abundantly with churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, presbyteries, and an efficient <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. While engaged in this great work he received generous encouragement and support from many of the wealthier members of his flock, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/03089b.htm">third Marquess of Bute</a>. Rev. Sir David Oswald Hunter-Blair, Baronet; Captain R. D. Barre Cunninghame, and others. Bishop McLachlan died 16 Jan., 1893, and was succeeded by the Right Rev. William Turner, the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/01041c.htm">Aberdeen</a>, 12 Dec., 1844; cons. 25 July, 1893. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> statistics for 1908 show a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 17,625 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, 21 missions, 41 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 30 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in active work, 28 elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 10 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities (all since 1875), and various <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was a suffragan of York (England) previous to 1472; from that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> until 1492 it was subject to St. Andrews; and from then until the extinction of the ancient <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> it was transferred to Glasgow. It is now a suffragan of the new Archbishopric of St. Andrews and <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>.
