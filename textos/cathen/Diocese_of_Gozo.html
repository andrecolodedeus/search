<h1>Diocese of Gozo</h1>  

<p>The diocese of Gozo (Goulos-Gaudisiensis), comprises the Island of Gozo in the Mediterranean Sea (seventeen miles west of the harbour of Valetta, Malta) and islet of Comino, and has a population of 22,700 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. It is more picturesque than the sister island of Malta, and the country, covered as it is with conical hills, is more fertile in its plains and valleys. On a central plateau the ruined fortifications of an ancient town contain the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> and public buildings, outside of which is a large suburb. Gozo is famed for its grotto of Calypso, at a little distance from which are the ruins of a Cyclopean temple, a most conspicuous monument of antiquity.

<p>Up to the year 1864, Gozo formed part of the <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Diocese of Malta</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, acceding to the repeated <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the people, erected it into a separate diocese <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. On 16 March, 1863, Monsignor Francesco Michele Butigieg, a native of Gozo, was appointed <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lita and deputy auxiliary of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, for the Island of Gozo. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 3 May of the same year, on 22 September, 1864, was created first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new Diocese of Gozo, and on the 23rd day of the following month made his solemn entry into the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Through the efforts of Mgr. Pietro Pace, who was then <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (now <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>), a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was established on the site formerly occupied by the San Giuliano Hospital, the revenues of which were appropriated to the new institution. This <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was inaugurated 3 November, 1866, and, by the express desire of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>, was placed under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. On the death of Mgr. Butigieg, Father Micallef, Superior General of the Augustinian Order, was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03793c.htm">Citt&agrave; di Castello</a> and appointed administrator of the Diocese of Gozo. He left Gozo in May, 1867, and in 1871 became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. His successor to the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was Mgr. Antonio Grech Delicata, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, a native of <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, who, in 1868, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gozo, and as such assisted at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. Mgr. Grech Delicata's charity towards the poor went so far that he even divested himself of his own patrimony. This worthy <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> died on the last day of the year 1876.

<p>On 12 March, 1877, Mgr. Canon Professor Pietro Pace, native of Gozo, was appointed to succeed Mgr. Grech Delicata, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Cardinal Howard. Under his administration the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was augmented by the installation of a meteorological observatory, which was inaugurated by the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04736a.htm">Padre Denza</a>, Director of the <a href="../cathen/15309a.htm">Vatican Observatory</a>. During this administration an episcopal <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> institute for girls was also established, under the care of the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, to whom was also entrusted the direction of the annexed <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>. The same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> provided the diocese with a new episcopal palace and new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, besides laying out large sums of money on the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1889, Mgr. Pace was promoted <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>. His successor in the See of Gozo (and actual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>) is the Reverend G. M. Camilleri, O.S.A., a native of Valetta (b. 15 March, 1842). Under Mgr. Camilleri's administration the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was celebrated, in October, 1903. This synod was of absolute necessity, as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was still governed under the rules of the Synod of Malta of 1703, and consequently lacked a safe guide adapted to the times. Constitutions and decrees were also <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> and published which gave new life to the working of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of Gozo was built in 1697-1703, by Lorenzo Gafa. Its ground plan is in the form of a Latin cross. Its interior is adorned with fine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. The "Massagiere di Maria", an Italian periodical, is recognized in the Diocese of Gozo as the official organ of the sanctuary of the Bl. Virgin ta Pinu.
