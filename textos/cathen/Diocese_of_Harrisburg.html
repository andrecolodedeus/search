<h1>Diocese of Harrisburg</h1>  

<p>(Harrisburgensis.)

<p>Established 1868, comprises the Counties of Dauphin, <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Lebanon</a>, Lancaster, <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, Adams, Franklin, Cumberland, Perry, Juniata, Mifflin, Snyder, Northumberland, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">Union</a>, Montour, and Columbia, in the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">State of Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> an area of 8000 square miles. Lycoming and Center Counties were also included within its original boundaries, but the two were taken from it in 1901, when the <a href="../cathen/01368a.htm">Diocese of Altoona</a> was formed. In 1868 the boundaries of the Diocese of Philadelphia were curtailed for the third time by the creation of the Dioceses of Harrisburg, <a href="../cathen/13633a.htm">Scranton</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15646c.htm">Wilmington</a>. There were then within the Harrisburg limits a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population estimated at 25,000, for whose care there were only a score or so of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and about as many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>

<p>As first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the Rev. Jeremiah F. Shanahan was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 12 July, 1868. He was the head of the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Philadelphia when he was selected to govern the new diocese; he was born 13 July, 1834, at Silver Lake, Susquehanna County, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 3 July, 1859. Progress was slow, as the people were poor. Bishop Shanahan died 24 Sept., 1886, at Harrisburg. Thomas McGovern, the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was born in 1832 at Swanlinbar, Co. Cavan, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 27 December, 1861, at Philadelphia. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Harrisburg, 11 March, 1888, and died there, 25 July, 1898. After his death an administrator had charge of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for nearly a year. At that time the churches had increased to fifty and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to fifty-five. John Walter Shanahan, third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and a brother of the first incumbent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1 May, 1899. Born in Susquehanna County, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, in 1846, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, 2 January, 1869, and when appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was superintendent of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Philadelphia.
