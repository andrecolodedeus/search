<h1>Diocese of Huesca</h1>  

<p>(OSCENSIS)

<p>Huesca embraces parts of the province of Huesca in north-eastern <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, seven <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the Broto valley and three within the limits of the Archdiocese of Saragossa, one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> being situated in the city of Saragossa itself. Its date of origin cannot be definitely ascertained; the earliest evidence of its existence is the signature of Gabinius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Huesca, to the decrees of the council held at Toledo in 589. <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore of Seville</a>, writing in the seventh century, (De viris illustr., c. xxxiv) mentions the presence of Elpidius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Huesca, at an earlier council, but this is not considered authoritative. After 589 we next hear of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> through a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held there in 598 which ordered annual <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> conferences and enacted various disciplinary measures. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> invasion of 710 rapidly worked toward Huesca; when the city was taken in 713 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> fled, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was directed from <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. In 1063 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was moved to <a href="../cathen/08260a.htm">Jaca</a>, where it remained till 1096 when Huesca was retaken and the original see restored by Pedro I. The history of the Diocese of Huesca is from this time on closely associated with that of the present <a href="../cathen/02285b.htm">Diocese of Barbastro</a>, which in 1571 was erected out of part of Huesca and, though formally joined with it again in 1851, has ever since been administered by a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. From 1848 to 1851 the See of Huesca was vacant. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the Right Rev. Mariano Supervia y Lostal&eacute;.

<p>The episcopal city of Huesca was long a centre for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and art. Ancient Osca was the seat of the famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Sertorius. After the failure of his plans at <a href="../cathen/11700b.htm">Perpignan</a>, Pedro IV in 1354 established a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at Huesca, which was maintained by a tax laid on the city's food, and which pursued a steady if not a brilliant existence until it was eclipsed by the great college at Saragossa. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter at Huesca, erected between 1100-1241, is one of the oldest Romanesque structures in the Peninsula, and the Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which dates from the fifteenth century is one of the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> landmarks of northern <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. It contains a magnificent <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of alabaster carved to represent the Passion. About the present Huesca is a double line of ancient walls. In the immediate neighbourhood are several old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, that of Monti-Arajon containing in its <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Alfonso I. The institute for secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> occupies the building formerly devoted to the old <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and in one of its vaults is the famous "Bell of Huesca", said to have been constructed from the heads of insurgent nobles who were executed by King Ramiro II. The Diocese of Huesca comprises 181 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 15 subsidiary <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 240 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 50 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. It has a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 87,659.
