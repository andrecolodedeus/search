<h1>Diocese of Hyderabad-Deccan</h1>  

<p>Hyderabad, also called Bhagnagar, and Fakhunda Bunyad, capital of the Nizam's dominions, was founded in 1589, by Mohammed Kuli, King of Golconda. The mission of <a href="../cathen/07592b.htm">Hyderabad-Deccan</a> was cut off from the Vicariate Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 20 May, 1851, and became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1886. It is bounded on the east by the Bay of Bengal, on the north by the Godavani, on the west by the frontier dividing the Nizam's dominions from the Presidency of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, and on the south by the Tungabudra and Kistna. The diocese lies partly in the native kingdom of the Nizam, and partly in British territory. Little is known of the early history of this region. Certain documents relate that in the reign of Ibrahiln Adil Shah I (1535-1557) there were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Moodgul, a town in the south-west of the district. It is likely that the earliest conversions were made by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who arrived in 1502. Soon after this we read of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Raichur and Chitapur, who were visited by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1637 sent the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a> to Bijapur, near Moodgul and Raichur. He also established then the Vicariate Apostolic of the Great Mogul. The first vicar was the oratorian, Father Mateo de Castro, who in 1637 had been named <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Deccan and Bijapur. In 1645 the Kingdom of Golconda and Pegu was added.

<p>Tavernier, who visited Golconda and Hyderabad 1645 and 1652, tells us that there were Portuguese and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in those two towns. Father de Castro was succeeded by Don Custodius de Pino, 30 April, 1669; the third vicar was Don Bisconti, 1696, but he died suddenly. After 1696 the vicars were Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. In 1720 the island of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a> was included in the vicariate, which gradually acquired the name Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>. It is said that some of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> expelled from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> in 1707, for not swearing fidelity to the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, evangelized Moodgul. In 1784 the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community was harassed by the infidels: but the government of Hyderabad ordered the Zemindars and local functionaries to prevent any injury to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In 1720 the island of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a> was included in the vicariate, which gradually acquired the name Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>.

Moodgul was supplied with <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries for the next fifty years. About the end of the eighteenth century, we find one named Velada at Raichur, another named Paradisi in Moodgul, and a third in Chitapur, named Lichetta. In 1784 Delhi and the northern portion of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> was given to the <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a> of Thibet; and the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Great Mogul restricted to Carwar, Golconda, and the Deccan. In 1797 Don Pedro d' Alcantara di San Antonio, fourteenth <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, nominated in 1794, sent Father Joas Louis to Bijapur and Golconda. The <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine Fathers</a> were at Jamaon and Mesulipatam in 1834; many of them were native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Brahmin caste from <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>. From 1550 till 1832 the Diocese of Hyderabad had no regularly appointed missions, except those of Moodgul, Masulipatam, and one other. Missionaries visited the country from time to time, but never stayed long.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> (the vicariate was established 25 April, 1832) was Rev. Daniel O'Connor, O.S A., who took possession in August, 1835. Moodgul, Raichur, Chitapur, Hyderabad, etc., belonged to his vicariate. In 1840 he resigned and was succeeded by Bishop Patrick Joseph Carew, afterwards transferred to the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>. On 21 April, 1841, Dr. John Fennelly succeeded him. Meanwhile Father Daniel Murphy had come to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> with Bishop Carew in 1839, and was given the mission of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. In 1840 he began to build a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in the latter place. It was completed is in 1850. In 1842 he erected a church at Bolarum. He was chosen as coadjutor to Mgr. Fennelly and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 11 October, 1846, at Kinsale, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. On 20 May, 1851, the mission of <a href="../cathen/07592b.htm">Hyderabad-Deccan</a> was made a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariate Apostolic</a> with Bishop Murphy as its first vicar. His territory covered all the present Diocese of Hyderabad with the exception of Moodgul and Raichur, which were not added until 1886. Mgr. Murphy had only four missionaries to assist him (Fathers O'Brien, Drake, Hampson, and Queen, all <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>); two of those were at Secunderabad, one at Masulipatarn, and one at Hyderabad. The new vicar erected a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> near Hyderabad. In 1854 he applied to the Foreign Mission Seminary at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> for more missionaries, and Fathers Pozzi and Barero were sent to him. There were some British regiments quartered near Secunderabad, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the place thus went up to 4000. Besides the college he built an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, and opened a new mission at Chadragoodaim, which had to be abandoned for lack of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In 1856, a native named Anthony <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and brought 120 others with him. He was made catechist, and thus began a small native congregation at Hyderabad. Between 1857 and 1864 six other missionaries came from <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities began to increase, but in 1864, owing to failing health, Bishop Murphy was forced to leave <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>.

<p>The vicariate was then entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> Seminary of Foreign Missions. Father Giovanni Domenico Barbero became <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05093c.htm">Doliche</a>, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 3 April, 1870. He procured some Sisters of St. Anne from <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, and in 1871 established them at Secunderabad where they opened an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> and a girls' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Bishop Barbero died 18 October, 1881, and was succeeded by Monsignor Caprotti. In 1886 the Vicariate of Hyderabad became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and Bishop Caprotti, titular of Abydos, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hyderabad; the districts of Moodgul and Raichur were added to the diocese. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was removed from Secunderabad to Hyderabad, and the erection of St. Joseph's <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun. In 1890 a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was opened there, and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> and natives. Bishop Caprotti died in 1897, and was succeeded by Bishop Vigano, who opened new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, at Raichur, Bezwada, and Kazipet. In 1894 the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> were introduced, and later the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of Mary. At the present time, besides 21 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> missionaries, there are in the there are in the Diocese of Hyderabad 50 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 18 native sisters, 70 native catechists: 11 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 78 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> 38 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys with a total of 1642 pupils; 14 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls with 920 pupils. There are two high schools in Hyderabad, one for boys the other for girls; and one each in Secunderabad, Raichur, and Bezwada, all under the Sisters of St. Anne; 6 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>; a home for the infirm, with 60 inmates in the care of the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, in Secunderabad, a dispensary in Raichur; a catechumenate, and a <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">Magdalen</a> Home under the care of the native sisters in Secunderabad, with branches in Raichur and Bezwada; an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls in Bolarum; two <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>; two soldiers' institutes, confraternities, etc. Students are prepared for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09588b.htm">Diocese of Mangalore</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Since its erection as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Hyderabad had held two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, the first on 28 February, 1889; the second on 9-11 December, 1902. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> amounts to 14,752 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> out of a total of 11 millions composed of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, etc. The annual number of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of adults is about 400; and of infants about 500. The languages spoken in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are Telugu, Tamil, Canarese, Coia, Marathi, and Hindustani.
<h2>Vicars apostolic of Hyderabad-Deccan</h2>
