<h1>Diocese of Jaca</h1>  

<p>(<em>Also</em> JACCA; <em><a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a></em> JACCENSIS).

<p>Located in the Spanish province of <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>. Jaca, the chief town of the mountain district of Sobrarbe, is situated on the left bank of the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, a tributary of the Ebro, about 2400 feet above sea-level. It was once the capital of the Jaccetani, a tribe mentioned by Strabo. This territory was the scene of battles between Sertorius and Pompey and later between Pompey's son Sextus and Caesar's generals.

<p>Ecclesiastically Jaca belonged originally to the <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Diocese of Huesca</a>. When in 713 the town of <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a> was seized by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, its <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were replaced by itinerant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, sometimes called <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, sometimes <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a> or Jaca, who lived either at Jaca or in the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a> de la Pena, San Pedro de Siresa, and S&aacute;save. A council held at Jaca in 1063 determined anew the boundaries of the <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Diocese of Huesca</a>, which thereafter included the present <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>, Jaca, and Barbastro, as well as a part of the Diocese of L&eacute;rida. Jaca was then made the permanent seat of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. At the same time Sancho II was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>, and hastened to request the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to confirm the decisions of the council. Meanwhile, however, King Sancho Ramirez of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> (1063-94) had won back from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> the city of <a href="../cathen/02285b.htm">Barbastro</a>, and had granted it to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Roda. Garcia, the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a> (1076-86), regarded this as an infringement of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> granted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Jaca by the Council of Jaca. He therefore renewed his petition to the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>) to have the decisions of the council confirmed, which request the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> granted (cf. Jaff&eacute;, "Reg. Pont. Roman", I, 2nd ed., Berlin, 1885, n. 5098). As, however, Bishop Raimundo of Rodo also obtained the confirmation of all his privileges from <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, a violent dispute arose between the Bishops Huesca and Roda as to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the churches of <a href="../cathen/02285b.htm">Barbastro</a>, Bielsa, Gistao, and Alquezar, which in 1080 was decided by the king in favour of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Roda. In November, 1096, King Pedro I of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> won back Huesca from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> now decreed (11 May, 1089) that, instead of Jaca, Huesca should again be the seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (cf. Jaff&eacute;, op. cit., I, 5703). But Jaca itself had a separate existence under a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, independent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>. It also retained its own <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, which originally followed the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, but in 1270 both this chapter and that of <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a> were secularized. Jaca was again erected into a separate diocese and was made suffragan to the Metropolitan <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">See of Saragossa</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (18 July, 1571), which decision was carried into effect on 26 February, 1572. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Pedro del Frago.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> statistics of 1907 Jaca possessed 73,659 inhabitants, 151 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 151 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 239 public and 10 private <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, 236 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 30 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regulars</a>, and 54 sisters. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian Hermits</a>, one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>; <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, 2 houses for the training of boys; <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and 18 professed sisters in the city of Jaca; <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> of St. Anna, who have charge of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Jaca; Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Mary, 1 house at Jaca; sisters of Mercy of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, with a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Jaca, and the Little Sisters of the Aged Poor, with a home for the aged in a suburb of Jaca. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dedicated to the Most Blessed Virgin of Pilar is a three-aisled basilica in Byzantine style, belonging in the main to the eleventh century; it was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1063 and altered in the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries. A religious and civil festival is held on the first Friday of May; it is called "Primer Viernesde Mayo", in memory of a victory said to have been won over the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> in the eighth century by Count Aznar aided by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of Jaca. It is celebrated with a solemn procession in which the entire <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter takes part. In the environs of Jaca are many hermitages, notably that of <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a> de la Pena. La Vergen de la Cueva is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the same cave in which three hundred nobles gathered at the time of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> invasion and proclaimed Garcio Ximenez King of Sobrarbe.
