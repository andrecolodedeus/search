<h1>Diocese of Jaffna</h1>  

<p>(JAFFNENSIS.)

<p>Situated in the northern portion of <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, Jaffna comprises the northern and north-central provinces of the island. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Jaffna dates back as far as the time of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>. In 1548 St. Francis visited Manaar and came to Jaffna to persuade the king to cease his persecutions against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In 1580, under the protection of the Portuguese, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church was built at Jaffna. The whole peninsula surrendered in 1591 to Andrea Furtado de Mendoza. Almost the entire population subsequently <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and embraced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The fort of Jaffna capitulated to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> in 1658. At that time there were in the peninsula 50 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and 1 <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and 14 churches. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> immediately manifested the most hostile disposition towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were banished, and giving them shelter was declared a capital offence. From that time dates the long <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which ended only with the surrender of <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a> to the British in 1796. To this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> belongs the Island of Manaar rendered famous by the apostolic labours of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of from 600 to 700 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who were executed by order of the King of Jaffna. Madhu, though a solitary spot in the middle of the jungle, has also its historical fame. For a long time during the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> it was the refuge of native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. To this spot they had transported a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> which is now enshrined in the new church. Madhu has developed into an important <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, where more than 40,000 <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> congregate every year for the feast of the Visitation.

<p>In 1845 Ceylon was divided into the two vicariates of <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a> and Jaffna, with Bishop Orazio Bettachini as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the latter. In 1847 the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a> arrived in <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>. In 1857 the Jaffna vicariate was handed over to the Oblates, and on the death of Bishop Bettachini, Bishop Semeria, O.M.I., was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. In 1868 Bishop Christopher Bonjean, O.M.I., succeeded Bishop Semeria. He had been in the missions for nine years in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and in 1856 had crossed over to Ceylon to join the Oblate Congregation. During his administration a great impulse was given to primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The pernicious effects of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were more than counterbalanced by the activity of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the missionaries. Subsequently Bishop Bonjean was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a>. Bishop Theophile Melirzan, O.M.I., succeeded him at Jaffna and, following in his footsteps, was named <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a> in 1893. In the same year Henri Joulain, Q.M.I., was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Jaffna.

<p>The entire population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is 499,200; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> numbering 45,500. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is in the hands of the Oblates ; 3 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> help in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> ministry. The total number of missionaries is 46. Attached to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is St. Martin's <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of junior students aspiring to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. St. Patrick's college and boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is the most flourishing institution of the northern province. It has a staff of 6 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> fathers, 1 native father, 2 brothers, and 15 native professors. The average number of students is 450. It is especially devoted to higher <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and prepares its students for the Cambridge Junior and Senior examinations and for the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> University Intermediate. Some years ago it was thought expedient to come into closer contact with non-Catholics and especially with the higher classes of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>. For this purpose a <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was attached to St. Patrick's college. The boarders number 100, with good prospects for the future. Jaffna <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, conducted by the Sisters of the Holy Family of Bordeaux, follows the same junior and senior courses, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls, as St. Patrick's. To the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> is attached a girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. The native Brothers of St. Joseph are occupied in teaching at Jaffna, Kayts, Manaar, and Mullaitivu. The native Sisters of St. Peter conduct primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in all the important stations of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. There are 127 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> under the control of the missionaries, for the vernacular and primary <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. At the two industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Colombogam and Mullaitivu 125 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> boys are taught agriculture and useful trades. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has conferences of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> and young men's associations for the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes. St. Joseph's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press is the home of the Jaffna <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Guardian, a weekly paper devoted to the interests of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Club has just been founded for the purpose of interests of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community.
