<h1>Diocese of Kansas City</h1>  

<p>(Kansanopolitana.)

<p>Established 10 September, 1880, to include that part of the <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">State of Missouri</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> south of the Missouri River, and west of the eastern boundary of the counties of Moniteau, Miller, Camden, Laclede, Wright, Douglass, and Ozark, an area of 23,539 square miles. At the same time, Bishop John Joseph Hogan, of the <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">Diocese of St. Joseph</a>, which comprises that part of the <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">State of Missouri</a> between the Missouri and Chariton Rivers, was transferred to the new see and continued also in charge of the <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">Diocese of St. Joseph</a> as administrator. This arrangement continued until 19 June, 1893, when separate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">Diocese of St. Joseph</a> was established, and the Right Rev. Maurice F. Burke, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03651a.htm">Cheyenne</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>, 28 October, 1887, was transferred to the title of St. Joseph. Kansas City is suffragan of St. Louis. When the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was established, it had 42 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 30 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 12,000. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, John J. Hogan, was born at Bruff, County Limerick, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 10 May, 1829. His early classical studies he pursued in his native land, after which he entered the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at St. Louis, Mo., where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 10 April, 1852. From that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> up to his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 13 September, 1868, he had an active and successful career, building up <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in a wide and sparsely settled section of north-western Missouri. As soon as he took charge of the <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">Diocese of St. Joseph</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and earnestness gave a new impetus to the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there, and the same was manifest with his advent to Kansas City. The number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> increased, new churches arose, additional <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities entered the diocese. In 1896 he asked for a coadjutor, and the Rev. John J. Glennon was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12101a.htm">Pinara</a>, and Coadjutor for Kansas City (29 June, 1896). Bishop Glennon, on 27 April, 1903, was transferred as coadjutor with the right of succession to the See of St. Louis and succeeded to that title 13 October, 1903.
