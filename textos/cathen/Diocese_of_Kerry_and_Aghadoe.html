<h1>Diocese of Kerry and Aghadoe</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of Kerry and Aghadoe (Kerriensis Et Aghadoensis), suffragan of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, is sixty-six miles in length, and sixty-one in breadth, containing a superficial area of 983,400 acres, and extending over the whole County of <a href="../cathen/08627a.htm">Kerry</a> and a portion of that of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>; in 1901 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was 187,346. This diocese, in its actual condition, was constituted by the union of two very ancient sees &#151; Ardfert and Aghadoe, but the precise date of this incorporation cannot now be definitely ascertained. All we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is that it had taken place before the Synod of Rathbrassil (1110), for it is there proposed and sanctioned that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the then united Diocese of Ardfert and Aghadoe should be at Rathass near Tralee. Our ecclesiastical historians give a detailed account of the various journeys of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, who, though visiting the neighbouring County of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, never set foot in Kerry, being content (as the ancient chroniclers say) with giving this remote corner of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> his blessing, while standing on some point of vantage in West Limerick and viewing the lofty mountains and vast bogs of ancient Kerry. Nevertheless, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from many sources that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced here at a very early period. This fact is attested not merely by the <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a>, but also by the many monuments of great antiquity and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> character which still exist in various districts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom we find mentioned in connection with the history of <a href="../cathen/08627a.htm">Kerry</a>, was named Erc, and there can be no reasonable <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was St. Erc of Slane, who died according to the Annals of Ulster in 512. He exercised episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the county before the birth of <a href="../cathen/02758c.htm">St. Brendan</a>, and from what we read about his relations with that great saint, must have resided there almost continuously for several years afterwards. It is very probable he came to Kerry soon after the mission of <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a>, who was sent by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> in 450 to preach to the tribes of West Munster, and "to unite them to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the saving waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>". This visit of <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a> was comparatively short, for he was called away to North Clare and Connaught, where his apostolic labours may have been more urgently needed. To complete, however, the conversion of <a href="../cathen/08627a.htm">Kerry</a> thus auspiciously begun, <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> sent one of his most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and devoted <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, St. Erc, who had spiritual charge not only of <a href="../cathen/08627a.htm">Kerry</a>, but also of a wide range of south-west Limerick, in the heart of which lay the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/08201c.htm">St. Ita</a> at Killeedy, over which he seems to have had <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. He was the special friend and tutor of <a href="../cathen/02758c.htm">St. Brendan</a>, the patron of <a href="../cathen/08627a.htm">Kerry</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 16 May. There is not among the ancient <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of Erin a more interesting figure than this patron of <a href="../cathen/08627a.htm">Kerry</a>. His travels by land, and still more his voyages by sea, have made him famous from the earliest times. Very ancient <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copies of his famous seven years' voyage in the Atlantic Ocean are found in several <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, while his romantic career was a favorite theme with the poets and romancers of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. (See Brendan, Saint.)

<p>The other ancient see included in the modern Diocese of Kerry, is that of Aghadoe. Another native saint, Finan Cam, was the first to build a church at Aghadoe, which in after times became the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It was this saint also who founded the famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Innisfallen, a lovely island in the Lower Lake of Killarney. It was here that one of the greatest of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland's</a> kings was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> - Brian Boru, who destroyed the power of the Danes at Clontarf in 1014, while his distinguished professor, Maelsuthain O'Carroll, was most probably the original compiler of the famous Annals of Innisfallen. The principal copy of this valuable work is preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. It begins with a general history of the great empires of the world down to A.D. 430. The remainder, and the more valuable portion of the Annals, contains a brief chronicle of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to 1319. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, owing to its situation, escaped the ravages of the Danes, who had worked such ruin on other churches in Kerry. Unfortunately, there are few records of the early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> either of Ardfert or Aghadoe previous to the Norman invasion in the twelfth century. All we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is, each had its distinct succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and each <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> had its separate chapter. But these, in the days of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, were allowed to lapse. The chapter of <a href="../cathen/08627a.htm">Kerry</a> was re-established by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">His Holiness, Pius IX</a>, in 1858. Owing to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and the disturbed state of the country, this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> had no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from 1610 to 1641, and again from 1653 to 1703, being governed during both these periods by <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>. From this latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> there has been no interruption in the episcopal succession.

<p>Many of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been men of distinction. We may mention Dr. Richard O'Connell (1641-1653), who at a very trying time successfully resisted the determined attacks of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the people. In modern times Kerry had <a href="../cathen/10569a.htm">Dr. David Moriarty</a> (1856-1877), a most accomplished <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator, and Dr. Daniel McCarthy (1878-1881), for many years professor in the College of Maynooth, and author of valuable works on <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were introduced into the diocese chiefly through the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of some of the ancient lords of the county. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> came to Ardfert in 1253, to Muckross in 1440, and to Lislaughtin in 1464. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in Tralee was founded in 1213. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> built the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">Kyrie Eleison</a> in Odorney in 1154, while at a much earlier period <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities existed at Killagha in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Kilcoleman, at Derrinane, at Rattoo, etc. During the reigns of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> and Elizabeth all those religious establishments were destroyed, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were expelled, while their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was confiscated. The successful career of Cromwell and his lieutenants had a still more disastrous effect on the religious condition of this remote see in southwest Munster. In modern times there has been a satisfactory revival. Though these ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> churches throughout the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, were utterly ruined in days of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, there has been a complete restoration from the wreck and disaster of those sad times. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> are again established in Tralee, while the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> flourish &#151; if not in lovely Muckross, still in Killarney not far away. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, which were mostly thatched cabins not so long ago, are now magnificent stone structures raised through the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy of a faithful <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, aided by the generosity and religious spirit of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of the county. The ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> at Ardfert and Aghadoe are now in ruins, but the modern <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/08627a.htm">Kerry</a>, canonically erected in the ancient <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Aghadoe by special <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 18 May, 1858, surpasses even old Ardfert &#151; still magnificent, though in ruins. It was designed by <a href="../cathen/12558b.htm">Pugin</a> and was begun under Bishop Egan in 1840. For over fifty years it remained in an unfinished state, but the present occupant of the See of Kerry and Aghadoe, Most Rev. Dr. John Mangan, has with characteristic energy undertaken the completion of this magnificent structure according to the original designs of its celebrated architect. Dr. Mangan was born in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Listowel in 1843, and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Killarney and Maynooth, where he won the highest academical distinctions. His missionary life in Kerry was mainly spent in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Glengariff and Kenmare, which, owing to their extent, always demand great labour on the part of their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. As a reward for his energy and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Aghadoe, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Kenmare, and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1901. He was raised to the episcopate, 21 July, 1904. This diocese consists of 51 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, has 49 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, two administrators, and 69 <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>. It has 99 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 2 friaries, 5 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and 17 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>.
