<h1>Diocese of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz</h1>  

<p>(REGINAE HRADECENSIS).

<p>This <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> see owes its origin to Emperor Ferdinand III, who, soon after the creation of the <a href="../cathen/09141a.htm">Diocese of Leitmeritz</a>, decided to establish another to replace that of Leitomischl, which had been founded in 1344 but had disappeared during the Hussite <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. Through the mediation of Cardinal Ernst von Harrach, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, he obtained from Countess Anna Eusebia von Harrach the domain of Chrast and the manor of Auretitz in the district of Chrudim, and gave them to the new diocese. <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII's</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of erection is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 10 November, 1664; Matth us Ferdinand Zoubek von Bilenberg, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Nikolaus at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, was appointed first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The new diocese embraced at first only the old district (<em>Kreis</em>) of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz, which, however, included the subsequently formed district of Bydzow with the exception of two <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. In 1784, during the reign of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, the diocese received its present boundaries by the addition of the two districts of Chrudim and Czaslau, separated for this purpose from the <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Archdiocese of Prague</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz worthy of special mention are: Johannes Adamus, Count Wratislaw von Mitrovic (1710-21), later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>; Joseph Adam von Arco (1776-80); Aloys Joseph, Count Krakovsk von Kolowrat (1812-30), d. 1833 as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>; Karl Borrom us Hanly von Kirchtreu (1831-74). Joseph Johannes Hais (1875-92), and Eduard Johannes Nepomuk Brynych (1892-1902) performed valuable services by their devotion to the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the development of pious associations, and the erection of churches. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Josephus Doubrava (b. 29 February, 1852; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 29 June, 1903).
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into 32 vicariates, and includes 1 <em>curatia canonicalis</em> (<a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> combined with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>), 2 provostships, 3 archdeaneries, 38 deaneries, 404 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> served by <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 16 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> served by members of orders, 10 other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, 11 chaplaincies in noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, 18 chaplaincies attached to foundations. At the close of 1909 the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> numbered 998, the regular 83. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains 1,476,942 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 50,037 non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and 11,372 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The great majority of the inhabitants are Czechs. Of the vicariates 16 are entirely Czech, 3 entirely German, while in 13 the population is partly German and partly Czech. Three-quarters of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are wholly Czech, over one-fifth wholly German, the rest include both German and Czech <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The great majority of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> are Czechs, who minister even in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> that are purely German, owing to the notable lack of German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. This latter phenomenon is to be explained partly by the fact that the Liberal tendencies long prevalent in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> have influenced German students against the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> life; partly by the material conditions of the German <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, which, being mainly in the mountains and far apart, repel German candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists of the dean, who is also <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, 7 regular and 6 honorary canons; the episcopal consistory is composed of the dean and 9 councillors. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, founded in 1802 and connected with the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> institute (1909): 6 professors, 3 tutors, 75 students; a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys, opened in 1860, with at present 142 pupils; the gymnasium of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Braunau. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders conduct 10 institutions for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and training of girls; 7 boarding-schools for girls; two training colleges for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> teachers, and 25 day nurseries and kindergartens.

<p>At the close of 1909, the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations for men in the diocese were: <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> at Seelau, 18 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 6 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at Braunau, 40 priests; <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, 3 fathers and 1 brother; <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, 8 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 7 brothers; Augustinians, 2 priests; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 2 brothers; <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> with 5 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 4 brothers; Brothers of Mercy, 2 houses with 3 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 11 brothers; <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. At the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were: <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> with 98 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> Nuns, 3 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Sisters of St. Francis, 13 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> with 187 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Sisters of Notre-Dame, 26 houses with 143 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Sisters of Mercy of St. Charles Borromeo</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> with 40 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> of the Holy Cross, 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> with 16 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Sisters of the Most Holy Sacrament, 2 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> with 13 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Sisters of St. Hedwig, 4 houses with 20 sisters. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has many institutions for alleviating distress and suffering, also many well-endowed charitable foundations. Special mention should be made of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> Institute for the Deaf and Dumb (the <em>Rudolphinum</em>) at K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz; the Asylum for the Poor at Kukus (founded in 1711); 60 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and homes for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and 10 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, all of which are conducted as religious institutions. Religious orders care for the sick in 12 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>.
