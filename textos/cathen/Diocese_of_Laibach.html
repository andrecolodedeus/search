<h1>Diocese of Laibach</h1>  

<p>(LABACENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and suffragan of <a href="../cathen/06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz</a>, embraces the territory of the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> crown-land of Carniola (Krain).
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Laibach was founded in the fifteenth century. From the overthrow of the Kingdom of the Avars (811) to the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the erection of the new see, the region now included in the diocese always belonged ecclesiastically to the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, of which is formed one of the five archdiaconates. The German emperors repeatedly invested the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> with the title and authority of Margrave of Krain (as in 1077, 1093, 1210), but the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> were never able to maintain themselves in this position for any length of time. <a href="../cathen/13218b.htm">Rudolf of Habsburg</a> secured the territory for the House of Habsburg, and as in the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> had been almost entirely acquired by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a>, Frederick III decided in 1461 to found a separate diocese in order to detach the province ecclesiastically also from <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. The erection of the Diocese of Laibach was confirmed in 1462 by <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, who made it directly dependent on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Sigismund von Lamberg (1463-88). The new diocese did not include the whole of Carniola, large portions of which were subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a> and Freising, while on the other hand parts of Carinthia and Styria, where the episcopal resident of Oberberg was situated, belonged to Laibach. The work of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was greatly hampered by this irregular distribution of their territory. The teachings of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> gained a footing in the diocese under the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Christoph Rauber (1495-1536), and still more under his successor, Franciscus Kazianer von Katzenstein (1534-44). The new doctrines found warm supporters in two <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons, Primus Truber and Paul Wiener, so that by the middle of the sixteenth century the greater part of the nobility and almost a majority of the middle class professed <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>.

<p>Bishop Johann Tautscher (1580-97), who lived most of the time at <a href="../cathen/06733d.htm">Graz</a> with Archduke Karl, energetically combated the further advance of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and labored incessantly for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the promotion of church services, and the reestablishment of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Still greater credit is due to his successor, Thomas Chro&euml;n (1598-1630), called the "Apostle of Krain", who in a few years brought about the triumph of the counter-Reformation in the city and diocese. His success was largely due to the aid received from the Archduke Ferdinand, who had become Emperor Ferdinand II in 1597, and from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who had been called to Laibach. In 1616 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sent a detailed report of his labors to <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a> (cf. Joseph Schmidlin, "Die kirchlichen Zustande in Deutschland vor dem Dreissigjahrigen Krieg", I, Freiburg, 1908. pp. 33-50; concerning Bishop Chroen see the monograph by Stepischneg, Salzburg, 1856). On the reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> by <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, Laibach was raised to an archdiocese (1787), the elevation being confirmed by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> in 1788. The <a href="../cathen/06654b.htm">Archdiocese of G&ouml;rz</a> was suppressed (see GORZ), and Laibach received as suffragans the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15754c.htm">Zengg-Modrus</a>, Gradisca, and later also Triest. In 1807 <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> dissolved the Archdiocese of Laibach, and made it once more a simple diocese directly dependent on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. On the re-elevation of <a href="../cathen/06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz</a> to an archdiocese in 1830, Laibach was made suffragan to it and given its present boundaries. The then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laibach, Antonious Aloysius Wolf (1824-59), received as compensation the title of prince-bishop. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Antonius Bonaventura Jeglic (b. 20 May, 1850, at Begunje; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 12 September, 1897, at <a href="../cathen/13725a.htm">Serajevo</a>).
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into 5 archdeaneries: Laibach, Upper Krain, Interior Krain Middle Krain, and Lower Krain. These are subdivided into 22 deaneries. At the beginning of 1909 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> contained 17 <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, 296 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (of which 28 were vacant), I vicarship, 3 ancient chaplaincies, 17 <em>Exposituren</em> (i.e. filial churches joined to the mother church only by some unimportant link to recall their former relations), 235 positions for assistant <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (95 vacant), 36 other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, 321 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 1000 dependent churches, 11 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> churches, 229 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. Besides the prince <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> there are 16 canons, 444 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 76 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in other positions, 51 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> retired on pensions, 134 regulars. The population consists of 572,613 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, about 400 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 290 Orthodox Greeks, 145 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The language spoken by the great majority of the inhabitants of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (about 94 per cent.) is Slovenian. German is spoken in the larger cities like Laibach and Rudolstadt, and in the German-speaking centre of Gotschee. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists of 12 regular and 6 honorary canons; they are nominated in part by the emperor, in part by noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> and the provincial council, and are partly the free appointment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Since 1493 a collegiate chapter has also existed in connection with the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nikolaus at Rudolfswert; it consists of a mitred <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and 4 members. The consistory of the prince-bishop is made up of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, 2 honorary canons, and 2 other members. The training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is provided for by a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> institute, founded in 1791, which has a pro-rector, 8 professors and 3 instructors; a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 63 students, and a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys, the <em>Collegium Aloysianum</em>, founded in 1846, which has 36 students. Ecclesiastical professors give religious instruction in the gymnasium of St. Veit near Laibach (190 students), in the 3 gymnasia and the upper high school at Laibach, also in other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>The Cathedral of St. Nikolaus was built 1700-07 in <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12330c.htm">Andrea Pozzo</a>. Hardly any large churches of the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> still exist, on account of the repeated incursions of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> into <a href="../cathen/08696a.htm">Krain</a> from 1396. The largest <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of the earlier ages still standing is that of Krainburg, built in 1491, of which the church at Bischoflack, erected in 1532, is a copy. The finest churches in the Barocco style are: the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church at Laibach (1546), the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter (eighteenth century) at the same place, and the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Jakob (1714), also at Laibach.
