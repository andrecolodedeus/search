<h1>Diocese of Loja</h1>  

<p>(Lojana), suffragan of <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>, <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, includes the greater part of the Provinces of Loja and El Oro. It thus occupies the southwestern portion of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, lying between the summit of the Andean Cordilleras and the Pacific Ocean. It has an area of about 10,000 square miles. The city of Loja is situated some 270 miles S.S.W. of <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>, in the Val de Canbamba. It was established about the year 1546 to protect travellers on the royal road from <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> to <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> against the attacks of the Indians, and is thus one of the oldest towns in the state. In 1580 the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> was held there; at which time the city contained, in addition to its <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>. It was at Loja that the valuable properties of the cinchona-bark, the source of quinine, were first discovered by a Spanish soldier who, having accidentally experienced its antipyretic qualities, by means of it cured the vice-reine of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, the Countess of Chichon (<em>a quo</em> cinchona), of a fever, and thus made it known to the world. Loja suffered much from earthquakes and Indian inroads. In 1861 it possessed a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church, a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, a consistorial house, and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. Five years later a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was erected at Loja, Mgr. Checa being the first occupant of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>; he was succeeded by Mgr. Riofrio, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>: the third <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was Mgr. Jos&eacute; Masi&aacute;, O.F.M.; born on 14 January, 1815, at Montroig, in <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Loja on 16 September, 1875. This illustrious <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> died in 1902 in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, a glorious exile for the Faith. After an interregnum of several years, Mgr. Juan Jos&eacute; Antonio Eguiguren-Escudero was appointed. Mgr. Eguiguren was born at Loja on 26 April, 1867; he studied at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 11 June, 1892. Shortly afterwards he became a professor in his <em>Alma Mater</em>; in 1901 he was named an honorary canon, and three years later was made Administrator Apostolic of Loja; on 6 March 1907, he was elected to fill the vacant see and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> on 28, July, 1907.

<p>With the exception of individual cases, there is no religion professed in the diocese but <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> (and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> among some of the Indians); many of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, however, are lukewarm and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has suffered from the hostility of liberal political parties in <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>. Only a very small proportion of the population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> origin, the remainder being a hybrid race of mixed Spanish, Indian, and <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">Negro</a> blood, known as cholos, zambos, or mestizos, with many pure-blooded Indians. The climate of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> varies from a mean of 18 degrees Celsius in the higher regions to torrid heat on the slopes of El Oro to the ocean. The principal towns are Machala, Santa Rosa, Zaruma, and Loja.
