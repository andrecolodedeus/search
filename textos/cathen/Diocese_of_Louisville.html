<h1>Diocese of Louisville</h1>  

<p>Comprises that part of <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a> west of the Kentucky River and western borders of Carroll, Owen, Franklin, Woodford, Jessamine, Garrard, Rockcastle, Laurel, and Whitley Counties, embracing an area of 22,714 square miles. Prior to the erection of the Covington Diocese (29 July, 1853), it embraced all the <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">State of Kentucky</a> with an area of 47,000 square miles. Originally it was called Diocese of Bardstown, and its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> administered spiritually a territory now divided into over twenty-eight <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (five of which are <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a>). The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who are known to have settled in Kentucky were William Coomes and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> (Mrs. Coomes was not only the first white <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> settler, she was also the first school-mistress) and Dr. Hart the first resident physician. They were among the first white settlers at Harrod's fort (Spring, 1775). <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers soon followed from <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and in a short time their numbers were greatly increased by an influx of Irish-born immigrants. The latter were probably more numerous at Hardin Creek station than at any other, with the sole exception of the wholly <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> settlement at Lower Cox's Creek (seven miles north of Bardstown), where the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> language was almost exclusively spoken (see <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">KENTUCKY</a>). Dr. Carroll was unable to send a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> before the year 1787, and religion suffered greatly thereby. The first missionary sent (1787) was Father Whelan, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, succeeded by Fathers <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Badin</a>, de Rohan, and Barri res, Fournier and Salmon. The first American-born <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> assigned to Kentucky was Father Thayer, a converted Congregational minister. He remained four years, only two of which were spent in missionary <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Father Nerinckx arrived at St. Stephen's on 18 July, 1805, and remained there with <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Father Badin</a> till 1811. He was a tireless and energetic worker, and erected ten churches. He founded the Sisterhood of Loretto (see SISTERS OF LORETTO). A colony of <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, under Fr. Urban Guillet, came to Kentucky in 1805, and settled on Pottinger's Creek, about one mile from Holy Cross church, and established a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys. Fr. Guillet, however, withdrew his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a> in the spring of 1809. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> under Father Fenwick came to Kentucky in 1806, and settled on a farm (now St. Rose's Convent near Springfield). A brick church was immediately begun but not finished until 1808. This was the cradle of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Upon the resignation of Father Fenwick, Father Wilson was appointed provincial and under him the foundation became prosperous and permanent. A <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> opened in 1808 was soon filled with candidates from the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.
<h2>Erection of the diocese of Bardstown</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> ("Ex debito", 8 April, 1808) erected Bardstown into an episcopal seat and appointed Rev. Benedict Joseph Flaget; a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician, as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The new diocese embraced the States of Kentucky and <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a> and its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was given <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a>, not only over his own diocese proper, but also, until other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> might prudently be formed, over the whole north-western territory (states and territories) of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> lying between 35 N. latitude and the Great Northern Lakes, and between the states bordering on the Atlantic Ocean and the Rocky Mountains, thus including the present States of Michigan, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>, about half of <a href="../cathen/01724a.htm">Arkansas</a>, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>. From this mother-see of the West were formed ten <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (including that of <a href="../cathen/09295a.htm">Little Rock</a>) in the life of its first sainted <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Though the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> for Flaget's <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> reached him in September, 1808, the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> did not for several reasons take place until 4 November, 1810, when Bishop Carroll, assisted by Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> (<a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>) and Bishop Egan (Philadelphia) <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him at St. Patrick's church, Fell's Point.
<h3>Bishops</h3>

<p>(1) Bishop Flaget accompanied by Fathers David and Savine, and three seminarians (one of whom, Guy I. Chabrat, was afterwards the second coadjutor to Flaget) reached Louisville from <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburgh</a> on 4 May, and arrived on 9 May, 1811, at Bardstown. Until a residence and church could be built, Bishop Flaget resided at St. Stephen's. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> found twenty-four stations and ten churches all built of logs, except the Danville church which was built of brick upon ground donated by an Irishman named Daniel McElroy, and with monies mainly given by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> in the vicinity, attended by six <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Kentucky then numbered about 6000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Outside of Kentucky, he had one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, one at Kaskaskia. The congregation at Vincennes, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, had no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and was indifferent. Cahokia had no <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, but was anxious for one. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sent Fr. Savine. There was no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. He had ten <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for a territory over which before his death ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> wielded the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>. Father David removed on 11 November, 1811, to the Howard house and farm and began to erect a log <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and brick church. On <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 1811, Bishop Flaget <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in St. Rose's church Guy Ignatius Chabret, first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> west of the Alleghanies. With the help of the seminarians who cut wood, burned the brick, and mixed and carried the mortar, a small brick church was built in 1816. Then (1817) followed the erection of a brick <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod in the west was held on 20 February, 1812. According to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> report to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (11 April, 1815) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had increased to 10,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, ministered to by 10 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, there were 6 <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> (5 of them <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>), 6 in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, and 6 <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsured</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 5 brick and 14 log churches; <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a> had about 25 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> 50 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> without a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> 130 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> attended occasionally from <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>; Illinois about 120 <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>; and Michigan 2000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> from its beginning, until 1819 had given eleven <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the missions. Vocations were numerous, but on account of the poverty of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, almost as many were turned away as were received. Burdened with episcopal labours too heavy for one, Bishop Flaget applied for a coadjutor with right of succession, and Rev. Father David, president of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, was appointed in the autumn of 1817, but the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was put off until 15 August, 1819, one week after the completion and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Bardstown, which had been begun on 16 July, 1816.



<p>Bishop Flaget was relieved of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> and North-Western Territory by the erection of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> (19 June, 1821) and the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Father Fenwick as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (13 January, 1822). A community of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> under guidance of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers was started (1822) near St. Rose's church. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> initiated (1823) a religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> called the Brotherhood of the Christian Doctrine, but it survived only three years. The year 1826 is notable for a wonderful renewal of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as the fruit of a series of missions all through the diocese. The missions were successful. Six thousand received the Sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist, 1216 were confirmed, and many converts were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. In 1828 Bishop Flaget <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Most Rev. James Whitfield, fourth <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. In September, 1828, he attended the First Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Soon after his return to Kentucky he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Dr. Kenrick</a> (6 June, 1830). A new church, a replica of Bardstown <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was built on Fifth street by the Rev. Robert A. Abell, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1830. The Sisters of Charity started a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls near the St. Louis's church. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, invited in 1828, arrived in 1832, and were presented with St. Mary's College by its founder and owner, Rev. Wm. Byrne. Whilst at St. Louis, Bishop Flaget received news from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that his resignation of the Bishopric of Bardstown had been accepted, and that his coadjutor, Father David, would be his successor.

<p>(2) Rt. Rev. John Baptist Mary David, b. in 1761, near <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> there on 24 September, 1785. Having joined the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and, in 1792, came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. He laboured on the <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> missions for twelve years with indefatigable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; and after teaching some years at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a> and St-Mary's, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, in 1810 he went west with Bishop Flaget, and established the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Thomas at Bardstown. He was a strict disciplinarian and an able and lucid professor. He founded the religious institute of <a href="../cathen/10724c.htm">Sisters of Charity of Nazareth</a> (November, 1812), and was their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior almost to the end of his life. Appointed coadjutor to Bishop Flaget in autumn, 1817, his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was delayed for almost two years by reason of his reluctance to accept the dignity. After his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, he continued at the head of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, discharging at the same time the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of professor and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> trained under him numbered forty-seven, of whom twenty-three were either natives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, or had been raised in it from childhood. Four of them became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; Chabrat (coadjutor to Bishop Flaget), Reynolds (Charleston), McGill (Richmond, Va.), Martin John Spalding (Louisville, and later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>). Upon succeeding to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> early in December, 1832, his first act was to appoint the former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Rt. Rev. B. J. Flaget, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> with as ample faculties as he could, and then forward his resignation to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> accepted the resignation (May, 1833), and reappointed Bishop Flaget to the See of Bardstown. Declining health compelled Bishop David, towards the end of 1841, to retire to Nazareth, where he died 12 July, 1841, aged 80, in the fifty-sixth year of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and twenty-second of his episcopate.

<p>(3) Bishop Flaget, reappointed to Bardstown, thus became its third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Dr. Chabrat was named his coadjutor (29 June, 1834). After consecrating him (20 July, 1834), Flaget left to him the details of the administration. In September, of the same year, a small church and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> were erected in <a href="../cathen/04462b.htm">Covington</a>, thus laying the foundation of the Covington Diocese. <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> and the eastern portion of Illinois, were removed from Bishop Flaget's <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> by the erection of the Diocese of Vincennes, 6 May, 1834. Bishop Flaget, in 1835, visited <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and made his episcopal visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The first weekly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper, "The Catholic Advocate", was published in Bardstown in 1836, succeeding a monthly magazine, the "Minerva", founded and edited by the faculty of St. Joseph's College, in October, 1834. During the years 1836-7 several churches were erected and dedicated, among them one at Lexington, Fancy Farm, <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Lebanon</a>, and Louisville (St. Boniface was the first erected for German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>). In April 1837, Dr. Chabrat attended the Third <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and made known Bishop Flaget's desire to have <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a> formed into a new diocese. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> established the <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Diocese of Nashville</a> on 25 July, 1837. Father Napoleon Joseph Perch&eacute; (afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>) organized a new city <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, Our Lady's of the Port. The diocese numbered at this time forty churches, seventy stations, fifty-one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, two <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a>, and nine academies for young ladies. Bishop Flaget returned to a Bardstown in September, 1839, and new churches were erected at Taylorsville and <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>. Louisville had in 1841 a population of 21,210. Owing to its increasing population and the development of its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions, the episcopal seat was transferred to it from Bardstown in that year, and Flaget became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Louisville and Bardstown.
<h2>Diocese of Louisville</h2>

<p>La Salle, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> explorer, was the first white man who visited the Falls of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> and the site upon which the city of Louisville is built. Thomas Bullitt and party arrived at the Falls on 8 July, 1773, and marked off the site of the city in August of the same year. Louisville was established by Act of the Legislature of Virginia on 1 May, 1780, on 1000 acres belonging to one John Connolly. Three <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Revs., Flaget, Levadoux, and Richard, met in Louisville and probably said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> there for the first time in 1792. It is not certain that any professing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> was resident before 1791. Several <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and American birth settled there between 1805 and 1825. In 1806 a large colony of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>, with their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, settled about one or two miles south of the city limits, and upon the southern bank of the Ohio, and though but very few of them were practical <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> they aided <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Father Badin</a> liberally. A church was erected on the corner of Tenth and Main streets, and opened on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 1811, but not finished until 1817. Father Philip Hosten attended it occasionally from Fairfield until 17 August, 1822, when he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Louisville. Typhoid fever was carrying off hundreds of the population when he arrived, and he ministered night and day to the sick and dying. He fell a victim to the fever and died, 30 October. He was succeeded in 1823 by Father Robert A. Abell, who attended the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the town proper, and the villages of Shippingport and Portland, St. John's, Bullitt county, on the southern, and those of New Albany and Jeffersonville on the northern bank of the Ohio. Father Abell was succeeded by Rev. J. I. Reynolds, who had for assistants Fathers George Hayden, McGill and Clark. Father Stahlsmidt replaced Father Clark, and gathered together the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Germans in the basement <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and thus laid the foundation of the first German congregation in the city.
<h3>Bishops</h3>

<p>(1) Rt. Rev. Benedict Joseph Flaget, on the removal of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from Bardstown to Louisville, appointed Father Reynolds <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and Rev. Dr. Martin J. Spalding, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Bardstown. A colony of five sisters of the Good Shepherd, from Angers, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, arrived in Louisville in 1842, and were installed in a home on Eighth street near Walnut purchased for them by Bishop Flaget. This was the cradle of this <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The confraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the Conversion of Sinners was established on 21 March, 1843, by Bishop Flaget. The coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Dr. Chabrat, being threatened with the loss of sight, tendered his resignation, which was at length (1847) accepted and Dr. Martin J. Spalding appointed in his place. Two <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Brothers from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> opened the first free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Louisville in 1847. The year previous the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, in charge of St. Mary's College for fourteen years, left the diocese. About May, 1848, negotiations between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of St. Louis were completed, by which the fathers took charge of St. Joseph's College, at Bardstown, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> founded by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Brothers. Soon after the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> arrived in Louisville, they erected a spacious edifice as a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> adjoining the free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The college attendance was from 100 to 200, and that of the free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> about 200 boys. Late in December, 1848, a colony of <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> from Melleray, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, arrived at and settled on a farm of about 1600 acres formerly belonging to the Loretto Sisters, and named Gethsemani. Bishop Flaget d. on 11 February, 1850 (see <a href="../cathen/06093a.htm">BENEDICT JOSEPH FLAGET</a>).

<p>Coadjutor Bishop Guy Ignatius Chabrat, b. at Chambre, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, on 28 December, 1787; d. at Mauriac, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, on 21 November, 1868. He came to Kentucky in 1809 and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 25 December, 1811. He did missionary <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> at St. Michael's, Fairfield, St. Clare's, and Louisville. He had charge for a short time (1823) of St. Pius's, Scott County. Upon the death of Father Nerinckz, Father Chabrat succeeded him as superior of the Loretto sisterhood till 1846. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (20 July, 1834) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bolina and coadjutor of Bardstown. When Bishop Chabrat was forced to resign by reason of his approaching blindness he retired (1847) on a comfortable pension to his old home in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He died in the thirty-fourth year of his episcopate.

<p>(2) Rt. Rev. Martin John Spalding, b. 23 May, 1810, was one of the first pupils of Father Byrne's College, afterwards of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Thomas, thence he passed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 13 August 1834, became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1844, coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on 10 September 1848, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on the death of Dr. Flaget, 11 February 1850. Upon the death of Dr. Kendrick, Bishop Spalding was elevated, 11 June, 1864, to the <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Archdiocese of Baltimore</a>. He appointed his brother, Rev. Dr. Benedict Joseph Spalding, administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1848 Bishop Spalding found 30,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the whole state, cared for by 40 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and at his departure there were 70,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with 51 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and 24 religious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the Diocese of Louisville. There were but 43 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches in the state in 1848; in 1864 there were 80 in the Diocese of Louisville. During the administration of Dr. B.J. Spalding the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> of St. Joseph's College left the diocese (see <a href="../cathen/14208a.htm">MARTIN JOHN SPALDING</a>).

<p>(3) Rt. Rev. Peter Joseph Lavialle, b. in 1820 at Lavialle near Mauriac, in Auvergne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, made his preparatory studies in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and came to Kentucky with his relative Bishop Chabrat, in 1841; he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1844, and assigned to work at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In the year 1849 he was appointed professor of St. Thomas's Seminary where he remained until Bishop Spalding, in 1856, made him president of St. Mary's College, which office he held until he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Louisville on 24 September, 1865. He invited the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers to locate in the episcopal city in December, 1865. The following year St. Joseph's and St. Michael's churches, Louisville, were dedicated, and a temporary frame church (St. Louis Bertrand's) built and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers commenced. Though exhausted from continued labours and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a>, he attended the Second Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in October, 1866, and on his return resumed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> visitation, but had to retire to St. Joseph's Infirmary, and thence to Nazareth Academy where he died on 11 May, 1867. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of Louisville <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Very Rev. B.J. Spalding was again appointed administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but he soon died (4 August, 1868). <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a> then appointed Very Rev. Hugh I. Brady administrator <em>sede vacante</em>.

<p>(4) Rt. Rev. William George McCloskey; b. on 10 November, 1823, in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, N. Y. He studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in New York City, but abandoning his worldly career he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Archbishop Hughes on 4 October, 1852. After acting as assistant for one year to his brother, Rev. John McCloskey, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the Nativity church, New York, he was appointed professor of Latin and afterwards of holy Scripture and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11335c.htm">St. Mary's College</a>, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and in 1857 was chosen as director of Mount St. Mary's Seminary, which office he held until he was appointed (8 December, 1859) by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the recently established American College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Upon the death of Bishop Lavialle the Pope named Dr. McCloskey to the vacant see, and he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by <a href="../cathen/12730c.htm">Cardinal Reisach</a> in the American College on 24 May, 1868. Bishop McCloskey ruled the diocese for forty-one years and died at Preston Park Seminary on 17 September, 1909. Very Rev. James P.
