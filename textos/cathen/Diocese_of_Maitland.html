<h1>Diocese of Maitland</h1>  

<p>(MAITLANDENSIS)

<p>Located in New South Wales. Maitland, the principal settlement on Hunter River, was chosen as the title for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1848, when Dr. William Henry Davis, O.S.B., was sent as coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/12201a.htm">Right Rev. Dr. Polding, O.S.B.</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, with the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maitland. However, it did not become a residential see until some twenty years later, when the first suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of New South Wales were established: Goulburn in 1864, and Bathurst and Maitland in 1865. The Right Reverend James Murray, then secretary to <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Cardinal Cullen</a>, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maitland, and, after being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the pro-cathedral of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> by <a href="../cathen/04564a.htm">Cardinal Cullen</a> on 14 November, 1865, proceeded to his distant diocese, of which he took possession on 1 November, 1866. The Diocese of Maitland, which served as an episcopal title to Bishop Davis, O.S.B., consisted of the borough of East Maitland only. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as constituted by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Papal Brief</a> of 1866, was very extended, and in 1887, at Bishop Murray's request in the first Plenary Council of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, a considerable reduction in its territory was made, bringing it to its present limits. The present Diocese of Maitland comprises that portion of New South Wales, which lies between Camden Haven and Red Head, stretching west as far as Wollar and Cassilis and north as far as Murrurundi. It thus lies between 31&ordm; 31' and 33&ordm; 7' S. lat., and between 149&ordm; 50' and 152&ordm; 51' E. long. The area is about 12,000 sq. miles. The rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches annually in the parts near the coast, and from 20 to 30 in the other parts. The mean annual temperature is 63&ordm;. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> contains a large area of coal-measures in the vicinity of Maitland and Newcastle; large stretches of rich arable land lie on the banks of Hunter and Manning Rivers, and fine pastoral tracts throughout.

<p>Among its population of some 150,000, Maitland has a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 30,000. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are for the most part of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> descent, but in a few places those of German descent are fairly numerous. There are twenty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> districts, each possessing a church and presbytery with one or more resident <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> (in all 40), and in nearly every district are one or more <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of teaching sisters (in all 30 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and 250 sisters). <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> unaided by the state have been established in every district, and are attended by about 4000 children. There is a <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Waratah, which is the centre of popular missions. The Marist Brothers have boys' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Maitland and Newcastle. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Nuns from Kingstown, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, have boarding and day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and are engaged in both secondary and primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, from Ennis and Callan, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, have a large number of primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, besides boarding and select <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> from <a href="../cathen/02349a.htm">Bathurst</a> have several day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and a boarding-school &mdash; all for primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Institute for Deaf Mutes in Australasia is conducted at Waratah by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Nuns. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> conduct an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for girls at West Maitland. The building and maintenance of the churches is carried on entirely by charitable offerings; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are also dependent on the small fees paid and on the charitable support of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Maitland's first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Right Rev. James Murray, died in 1909. He was succeeded by Right Rev. Patrick Vincent Dwyer, the first Australian-born <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1882, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> coadjutor-bishop in 1897.
