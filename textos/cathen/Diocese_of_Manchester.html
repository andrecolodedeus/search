<h1>Diocese of Manchester</h1>  

<p>(MANCHESTERIENSIS)

<p>A suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Archdiocese of Boston, U.S.A.</a> The city of Manchester is situated on the Merrimac River, in the <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">State of New Hampshire</a>, and was granted its charter 10 July, 1846. Its population is about 70,000, nearly three-fifths of which is <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. There are in the city nine large <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches with flourishing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. There are also two small churches, a succursal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church.

<p>The Diocese of Manchester was established 4 May, 1884, by a division of the <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Diocese of Portland</a> which had included both Maine and <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>. It comprises the entire <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">State of New Hampshire</a>, an area of 9305 sq. miles. The total population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is 412,000, of which 126,034 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>Much of the early history of Manchester is bound up in the records of the <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Diocese of Portland</a>, of which it formed a part for twenty-nine years. Mass was first celebrated in <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a> as early as 1694, but the real history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> can hardly be said to begin until a century and a quarter later. So few were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at first, that up to 1822 there were not enough <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in the entire state to warrant the appointment of even one resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to be permanently located in <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a> was Rev. Virgil Barber, whom Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> in 1822 sent to Claremont, his native town, there to form the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in the state. Eight years later a small church was built at Dover. Two missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Fathers Canavan and John B. Daly, cared for the spiritual interests of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> scattered throughout the state. In 1848 Manchester, with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 300, was given its first resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, Rev. William McDonald, notable on account of his personal character and his establishment of religious, charitable, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/02727a.htm">Denis Mary Bradley</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was born in Castle Island, County Kerry, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 23 Feb., 1846; died 13 Dec., 1903. At the age of eight he came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, settling at Manchester. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was obtained at the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Manchester and at Holy Cross College, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. On the completion of his academic course he entered St. Joseph's Seminary, Troy, New York, where, on 3 June, 1871, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. He was assigned <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, and three years later <a href="../cathen/02191a.htm">Bishop Bacon</a> appointed him chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which offices he filled until June, 1880, when he came to Manchester as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Joseph's Church. This appointment proved to be the first step towards the formation of the Diocese of Manchester, as four years later (4 May, 1884), <a href="../cathen/02727a.htm">Father Bradley</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the newly-erected See of Manchester, and selected his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place 11 June, 1884. <a href="../cathen/02727a.htm">Bishop Bradley</a> was a man of tireless activity and rare <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. For almost twenty years he devoted his best efforts to the cause of religion in <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, and with wonderful success. At his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the diocese comprised a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 45,000. The number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work and missionary labours was 37, officiating in as many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>. There were 3 orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with 89 members. At the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> death the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was 104,000, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> numbered 107. There were resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> in 65 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 67 missions were regularly attended, and there were 8 orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and 4 of men, engaged in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children and in charitable work.

<p>John Bernard Delany, second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Manchester, born 9 Aug., 1864, in Lowell, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>; died 11 June, 1906; pursued his classical and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies at Holy Cross College, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, and Boston College, from which he was graduated in June, 1887. He studied for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at St. Sulpice, Paris, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 23 May, 1891. He served as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> at St. Anne's Church, Manchester, and the Immaculate Conception Church, <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a>, and in 1898 came to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Manchester as chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and secretary to <a href="../cathen/02727a.htm">Bishop Bradley</a>. While serving in this capacity he founded the "Guidon", a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> monthly magazine and the official organ of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, of which he was editor till his elevation to the episcopate (6 July, 1904). His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place 8 Sept., 1904.

<p>George Albert Guertin, third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Manchester and present (1910) incumbent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, born 17 Feb., 1869, in Nashua, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of his native city, after which he went to St. Charles College, <a href="../cathen/13756d.htm">Sherbrooke</a>, <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, and St. Hyacinthe College, <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>, to pursue his classical studies. He then entered St. John's Seminary, Brighton, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, and was the first graduate of that institution who became a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 17 Dec., 1892. Having displayed <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and ability in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work, he was appointed third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Manchester, 2 Jan., 1907, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 19 March, 1907. Under his guidance the diocese continues to grow steadily and healthily. It has a well-equipped <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system. There are 38 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with a corps of 309 teachers and an enrolment of 13,100 pupils.
