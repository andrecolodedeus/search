<h1>Diocese of Meaux</h1>  

<p>(MELDENSIS.)

<p>Meaux comprises the entire department of Seine and Marne, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> until 1622, and subsequently of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> had given to the Diocese of Meaux the department of Marne, separated from it in 1821 and 1822 by the establishment of the archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and the episcopal See of <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>. The present Diocese of Meaux is made up of the greater part of the former Diocese of Meaux, a large part of the former <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Diocese of Sens</a>, a part of the former Diocese of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and a few <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the former Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> and Senlis. Hildegaire, who lived in the ninth century, says in his "Life of St. Faro" (Burgundofaro), that this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the twentieth since St. Denis. According to the tradition accepted by Hildegaire, St. Denis was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux, and was succeeded by his disciple St. Saintin, who in turn was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a>; and another saint, named Rigomer, occupied the See of Meaux at the close of the fifth century. In 876 or 877, <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> showed Charles the Bald a document which he claimed had been transcribed from a very old copy and according to which <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> and St. Saintin, disciples of St. Denis, had brought to Pope Anacletus the account of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Denis, and on their return to Gaul had successively occupied the See of Meaux. (For these traditions see <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">PARIS</a>.)

<p>According to Mgr. Duchesne, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux historically known is Medovechus, present at two councils in 549 and 552. Of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Meaux the following may be mentioned (following Mgr. Allou's <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>): St. Faro (626-72), whose Sister St. Fara founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Faremoutiers, and who himself built at Meaux the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Croix; St. Hildevert (672-680); St. Pathus, who died about 684 before being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; St. Ebrigisilus (end of the seventh century); St. Gilbert (first half of the eleventh century); Durand de St-Pour&ccedil;ain (1326-1334), commentator on the "Book of Sentences", known as the "resolutive doctor"; Philippe de Vitry (1351-1361), friend of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> and author of the "Metamorphoses d'Ovide Moralis&eacute;es"; Pierre Fresnel (1390-1409), several times ambassador of Charles VI; Pierre de Versailles (1439-1446), charged with important missions by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, and who, when commissioned by Charles VII in 1429 to examine <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>, had declared himself convinced of the Divine mission of the <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Maid of Orl&eacute;ans</a>; Guillaume Bri&ccedil;onnet (1516-1534), ambassador of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> to <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, and during whose episcopate the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was introduced by Farel and G&eacute;rard Roussel, whom he had personally called to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for the revival of studies; Cardinal Antoine* du Prat (1534-1535), who had an active share in the drawing up of the concordat between <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>; the controversial writer and historian Jean du Tillet (1564-1570); Louis de Br&eacute;z&eacute;, twice <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, first from 1554 to 1564, then from 1570 to 1589, during whose episcopate the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was greatly disturbed by religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>; Dominique S&eacute;guier (1637-1659), the first <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to establish "ecclesiastical conferences" in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; the great <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> (1681-1704); Cardinal de Bissy (1705-1737), celebrated for his conflict with the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>; De Barral (1802-1805), later Grand Almoner of Empress Josephine and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, who took a prominent part in 1810 and 1811 in the negotiations between <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. In 1562 most of the inhabitants of Meaux had become <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and Joachim de Montluc, sent by the king, proceeded with rigour against them. They were still sufficiently powerful in 1567 to attempt to carry off, in the vicinity of Meaux, <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catherine de Medici</a> and Charles IX; and so for that reason, shortly after St. Bartholomew's day, Charles IX ordered the massacre of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of Meaux. At the ch&acirc;teau of Fontainebleau, built by <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, was held the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conference of 4 May, 1600, between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (Cardinal du Perron, de Thou, Pithou) and the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> (du Plessis Mornay, Philippe Canaye, Isaac Casaubon).

<p>A number of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are found in the history of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>: St. Autharius, a relative of St. Faro, who received St. Columbanus in his domain at Ussy-sur-Marne, and father of Blessed Ado, who founded about 630 the two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Jouarre, and of <a href="../cathen/11360b.htm">St. Ouen</a> who founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rebais in 634 and subsequently became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>; the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a> St. F&eacute;fre or Fiacre, and the missionary St. Chillen, both <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irishmen</a>, contemporaries of St. Faro (first half of the seventh century); St. Aile (Agilus), <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Luxeuil who became in 634 the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Rebais; St. Telchilde, died about 660, first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Jouarre; St. Aguilberte, second <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Jouarre, a sister of St. Ebrigisilus (end of seventh century); <a href="../cathen/02348b.htm">St. Bathilde</a>, wife of Clovis II, foundress of the abbey of Chelles, died in 680; St. Bertille, first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Chelles, and St. Etheria, first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Notre-Dame of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> (658), both of them pupils at the abbey of Jouarre; finally, St. Vincent Madelgaire (or Mauger), founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Haumont and Soignies; his wife, St. Waldetrude, foundress of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mons; St. Aldegonde, sister of St. Waldetrude, first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Maubeuge; St. Landry, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Soignies, claimed by some as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux; St. Adeltrude and St. Malberte, <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Maubeuge, the last three being children of St. Vincent Madelgaire and St. Waldetrude (seventh century).

<p><a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> stayed some days at Meaux in 1147. In 1664 Blessed Eudes preached for two months at Meaux, <a href="../cathen/07092b.htm">Mme Guyon</a> passed the first six months of 1695 at the Visitation <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Meaux, where <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> had frequent conferences with her, but failed to make her abandon her peculiar views. The celebrated P&egrave;re Loriquet (1767-1845) was superior from 1812 to 1814 of the preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Ch&acirc;age, in the Diocese of Meaux. The <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> massacres on 2 and 3 September, 1792, at the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> of the Carmes and the Abbaye had their counterpart at Meaux where seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were massacred in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> on 4 September. The Abbey of Notre Dame de Juilly of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> was established in 1184, and adopted the rule of the Abbey of St-Victor of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. <a href="../cathen/08530c.htm">Cardinal de Joyeuse</a> was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> from 1613-1615. In 1637 P&egrave;re de Condren, Superior of the Oratory, took possession of it, and in 1638 the house of Juilly became a royal academy for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young men. The new order of studies approved by <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> marked a pedagogical revolution: the Latin grammars written in Latin were abandoned and French textbooks were used in the study of the dead languages. The college became national <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in 1791, and was re-purchased in 1796 by a few <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>; in 1828 by Salinis, future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a> and Scorbiac, chaplain-general of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; in 1840 by the <a href="../cathen/02353a.htm">Abb&eacute; Bautain</a>; finally, in 1867, the college returned into the hands of the new <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Congregation of the Oratory</a> founded by the Abb&eacute; P&eacute;tetot. In the salon of the Abb&eacute; de Salinis, at Juilly, was established in December, 1830, the Agence g&eacute;n&eacute;rale pour la d&eacute;fense de la libert&eacute; religieuse. <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> resided at Juilly while editor of "L'Avenir". It was at Juilly, in 1836, that the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/06470b.htm">Gerbet</a>, founded the review "L'Universit&eacute; Catholique". Among the students at Juilly in the seventeenth century were the Marshals de Berwick and de Villars; in the nineteenth, Mgr de M&eacute;rode and the famous lawyer, <a href="../cathen/02517a.htm">Berryer</a>.

<p>A council convoked in 845 at Meaux by Charles the Bald adopted important measures for the re-establishment of discipline in the three ecclesiastical provinces of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Other councils were held at Meaux in 962, 1082, 1204, 1229 (ended in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>), where the Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> was reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; in 1240 a council was held in which the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was pronounced against <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> by Joannes of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>; there was held an important council in 1523. Four councils were held at Melun, in 1216, 1225, 1232, 1300. The city of Provins was famous in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> for its burlesque ceremonies (f&ecirc;te de fous, f&ecirc;te do l'&acirc;ne, f&ecirc;te des Innocents) held in the church. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St-Etienne de Meaux is a fine Gothic edifice begun about 1170. The church of Champigny has a magnificent <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the thirteenth century. The principal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre Dame do Lagny, dating from 1128; Notre Dame du Ch&ecirc;ne de Preuilly, dating from the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey (1118); Notre Dame du Ch&ecirc;ne at Crouy-sur-Ourcq, dating from the beginning of the seventeenth century; Notre Dame de Bon Secours near Fontainebleau (the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> was established in 1661 by d'Auberon, an officer of the great Cond&eacute;); Notre Dame de la Cave at Champigny; Notre Dame de Piti&eacute; at Verdelot; Notre Dame de Melun at Melun; Notre Dame du Puy at Sigy. The head of St. Veronica at Pomponne has long been the object of a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, greatly furthered by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1670; the cloak (<em>chape</em>) of St. Martin of which a large portion is preserved at Bussy-St-Martin, also attracts <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>.

<p>Before the application of the Associations Law of 1901 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities were represented in the diocese by the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>, <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a>, Fathers and Brothers of St. Mary of Tinchebray, School Brothers of the Christian Doctrine. Of the congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> the following may be mentioned: the Celestine Sisters, a teaching and nursing order founded in 1839 (mother-house at Provins); the Sisters of St. Louis, a nursing and teaching order, founded in 1841 by the <a href="../cathen/02353a.htm">Abb&eacute; Bautain</a> (mother-house at Juilly), the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> of Meaux, called Carmel of Pius IX, founded 30 August, 1860. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of the Sacred Heart of Mary, devoted to teaching and contemplation, restored in 1837 the ancient abbey of Jouarre. The religious congregations had under their care: 4 cr&egrave;ches, 52 day nurseries, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for boys, 15 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 14 industrial rooms, 10 houses of mercy, 26 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or asylums, 19 houses for the care of the sick in their own homes, 1 house of retreat. In 1908 the Diocese of Meaux had 361,939 inhabitants, 39 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 402 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 8 vicariates.
