<h1>Diocese of Menevia</h1>  

<p>(MENEVENSIS)

<p><em>Menevia</em> is said to be derived from <em>Menapia</em>, the name of an ancient Roman settlement supposed to have existed in Pembrokeshire, or <em>Hen Meneu</em> (<em>vetus rubus</em>) where St. David was born. From the time of the establishment of the four <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in 1688, <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> belonged to the Vicariate of the Western District. In 1840 it was made a separate vicariate by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>: in 1850 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was re-established, and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> was divided between the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a> and Newport. In 1895 the principality, with the exception of Glamorganshire was again formed into a separate <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>. Right Rev. Francis Joseph Mostyn, son of Sir Pyers Mostyn, eighth baronet, of Talacre in North <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, was appointed first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, his <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> being Ascalon. In 1898 he was transferred to Menevia when the vicariate was made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Menevia is the only member of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> who holds one of the ancient titles of pre-Reformation times. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is under the patronage of <a href="../cathen/11360c.htm">Our Lady Help of Christians</a>, St. David, and <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride</a>, patrons of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. It covers 6500 square miles of country, most of which is rugged and mountainous; there are no large towns, so that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of some 8500 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is much scattered in country districts. To meet the spiritual needs of this little flock there are forty-three public churches, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and stations, besides twelve <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> belonging to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. The number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (in 1910) is eighty-two, twenty-eight seculars and fifty-four regulars; more than half this number of regulars is accounted for by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Breton <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, at Caermaria, near Cardigan, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> at Pantasaph, and <a href="../cathen/02540a.htm">St. Beuno's</a> College, the theologate of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. These religious, as well as <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a> and <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, serve various missions throughout the diocese. There are <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of nine congregations of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, the Sisters of the Holy Ghost (White Sisters) having no less than seven. The church of Our Lady of Dolours, Wrexham, serves as pro-cathedral; on 10 August, 1909, a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, consisting of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and four canons, was erected.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is rich in relics of the Ages of Faith, thickly strewn as it is with churches once <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, but now used for <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> worship, and with ruins of ancient <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sanctuaries and holy wells named after the countless <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the British Church; most famous of these is the holy well of <a href="../cathen/15656a.htm">St. Winefride</a> at <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a>, which is and always has been in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> hands. This <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> well has been a centre of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> from the earliest days of authentic <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> history, and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> still attracts her votaries to the shrine, and dispenses her <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> favours even in this unbelieving age. The beautiful building which stands over the well was erected towards the close of the fifteenth century. The mission has been served by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> since about 1600. St. Mary's College is a small episcopal college in the town, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of boys to supply <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> language is a prominent feature in the curriculum. The Diocese of Menevia is the restoration of the ancient <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Diocese of St. David's, the foundation of which, in the latter half of the sixth century, is traditionally attributed to that saint. The contention of recent historians that there were no territorial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> at so early a date, but only monastic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> without sees, is considered baseless by Dr. Zimmer, no partisan authority. "Though monasticism was strong in it, it did not impart to the (Welsh) Church either its character or its form" (Realencyklop&auml;die, X, 224). The four independent <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> sees were co-extensive with the four independent principalities that had come into being during the sixth century; Menevia with Dyfed, Llandaff with Gwent, <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a> with Powys, Bangor with Gwynedd.

<p>The records of the history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> before Norman times are very fragmentary, consisting of a few chance references in old chronicles, such as "Annales Cambri&aelig;" and "Brut y Tywysogion" (Rolls Series). Originally corresponding with the boundaries of Dyfed (Demetia), St. David's eventually comprised all the country south of the River Dovey and west of the English border, with the exception of the greater part of Glamorganshire, in all some 3500 square miles. Though it was never an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, it is far from clear when St. David's came definitely under the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. About 1115, however, Henry I intruded a Norman, Bernard (1115-1147), into the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Bernard's rule was wise and vigorous; but on the death of Henry he claimed <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and presented his suit unsuccessfully before six successive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. This claim was afterwards revived in the time of <a href="../cathen/06568d.htm">Giraldus Cambrensis</a>. Among the more famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> may be mentioned Peter de Leia (1176-1203), who began the building of the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. David's; Henry Gower (1328-47); and Edward Vaughan (1509-23), who made considerable additions to the same; the learned John Thorshy (1347-50) afterwards transferred to the Archbishopric of York; <a href="../cathen/03656a.htm">Henry Chicheley</a> (1408-14), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> William Barlow (1536-48), the so-called consecrator of Archbishop Parker in 1559. The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Henry Morgan (1554-59), was, like the rest of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, deprived of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by Elizabeth, but was saved by death from sharing their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for the Faith.

<p>The oldest portions of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dating from 1180 belong to the period of transition from the Early English to the Decorated style of architecture; the additions of Bishop Gower, including the beautiful stone rood screen, are excellent examples of the Decorated style, while to the north of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> are the ruins of his magnificent episcopal palace. In 1862 a partial restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun by Sir G. G. Scott. The shrine of St. David in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was a famous place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>; it is said that by favour of <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>, who <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, two <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to St. David's were to be accounted equal to one to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: &mdash; <blockquote>

<p>Meneviam pete bis, Roman adire si vis; <br>Merces &aelig;qua tibi redditur hic et ibi; <br>Roma semel, quantum dat bis Menevia, tantum </blockquote>

<p>(ancient lines found at the shrine by Archbishop Peckham, 1240-92).
