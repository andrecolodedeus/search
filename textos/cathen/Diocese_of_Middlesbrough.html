<h1>Diocese of Middlesbrough</h1>  

<p>(MEDIOBURGENSIS)

<p>In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval history</a> it was known as Myddilburga or Middilburga, with many other variations of form. There is an old tradition that a church in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/07350a.htm">St. Hilda</a> was dedicated by <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> at Middlesbrough about 686, but the earliest positive reference to Middlesbrough in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> goes to show that in the beginning of the twelfth century it was the site of a church dependent on the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/07350a.htm">St. Hilda</a> at Whitby. At that time the church of "St. Hilda at Middlesburc" was given by Robert de Brus of Skelton Castle, founder of Guisborough Priory, to the Black Monks of St. Benedict at Whitby, on condition that there should always be some <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at Middlesbrough serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/07350a.htm">St. Hilda</a>; and there seems to have been a clause binding the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to distribute twelve pence per week in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the poor of Middlesbrough for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the said Robert de Brus. In the plunder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> the "Cell of Middlesbrough" was granted by Queen Elizabeth to one Thomas Reeve on 4 February, 1563. From that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> there is no evidence to show that Mass was ever celebrated there, until in 1848 a private room in North Street was used for this purpose. A little later a modest <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was erected and a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> placed in charge. Two causes concurred in the formation of a large <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation, namely, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigration and the rapid development of the ironworks in the Cleveland region.

<p>In 1872 Rev. Richard Lacy was entrusted with the charge of the Middlesbrough Mission. In August, 1878, St. Mary's church (replacing the original modest <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>) was opened with great solemnity by <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> and Bishop Cornthwaite of Beverley. In December of the same year, St. Mary's became the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the new Diocese of Middlesbrough. The <a href="../cathen/02540b.htm">Diocese of Beverley</a>, conterminous with Yorkshire, was, by Apostolic Letters of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 20 December, 1878, divided into the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a> and Middlesbrough, Bishop Cornthwaite (formerly of Beverley, henceforth of <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a>) being <em>ad interim</em> named administrator of the new Diocese of Middlesbrough. It was not until 11 December, 1879, that the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> was received notifying the appointment of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Rev. Richard Lacy, whose <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place in his own <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> on 18 December, 1879, at the hands of <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a>, assisted by Bishop Cornthwaite of <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a> and Bishop O'Reilly of <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>. The chapter of the new diocese, consisting of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and ten canons, was erected by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 13 February, 1881. Our Lady of Perpetual Succour is the chief patroness of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and titular of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> Sts. Wilfrid and <a href="../cathen/08469b.htm">John of Beverley</a> are its secondary patrons. Besides these there are many others who have shed the lustre of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> on northern Yorkshire: <a href="../cathen/07350a.htm">St. Hilda</a>, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Whitby (scene of the famous <a href="../cathen/15610a.htm">Synod of Whitby</a> in 664); St. John of Bridlington; St. William of York; St. Everilda; <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Blessed John Fisher</a>; <a href="../cathen/14697a.htm">Blessed Thomas Percy, Earl of Northumberland</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12319a.htm">Venerable Nicholas Postgate</a>, and many others.

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> division of Yorkshire met with adverse criticism at the hands of several leading members of both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, moved by sentiment rather than a profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the needs of religion, the following statistics demonstrate both how groundless were the fears then entertained, and how accurately the situation had been gauged by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. In 1839 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of Yorkshire was 13,000; in 1909 it was 167,027. In 1839 there could hardly be 3000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in what is now the Diocese of Middlesbrough; in 1909 they numbered 50,344. In 1879 the total number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the Diocese of Middlesbrough was 54; in 1909 they numbered 113 (76 seculars and 37 regulars). In 1879 the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were 38; in 1909 they were 67. In 1879 the school-children numbered 3135; in 1909 they numbered 10,060. In 1879 there were 17 elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; in 1909 there were 43. There are 23 elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and 14 middle-class <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> conducted by religious; two <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, one for boys under the <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a> at Hull, and the other for girls under the Poor Sisters of Nazareth at Middlesbrough; one reformatory for boys under the Fathers of Charity at Market Weighton; two pupil teachers' centres, one under the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> at Hull, and the other under the Faithful Companions of Jesus at Middlesbrough; one training college for teachers, under <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, at Hull; two colleges for boys, one under the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a>, at Middlesbrough, the other under <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, in connexion with the well-known Abbey of Ampleforth.

<p>Bishop Lacy was born at Navan, <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 16 January, 1841, studied at <a href="../cathen/15233b.htm">Ushaw College</a> (<a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>) and at the English College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 21 December, 1867.
