<h1>Diocese of Montauban</h1>  

<p>(MONTIS ALBANI)

<p>A suffragan of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, comprises the entire department of Tarn and Garonne. Suppressed in 1802 and divided between the three neighbouring <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="../cathen/01209b.htm">Agen</a>, and Cahors, Montauban was re-established by imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1809, but this measure was not approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Re-established by the concordat of 1817, it was filled only in 1824.

<p>In 820 the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> had founded the Abbey of Montauriol under the patronage of St. Martin; subsequently it adopted the name of its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> <a href="../cathen/14568b.htm">St. Theodard</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Narbonne, who died at the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 893. The Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, Alphonse Jourdan, took from the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 1144 its lands on the heights overlooking the right bank of the Tarn, and founded there the city of Montauban; a certain number of inhabitants of Montauriol and serfs of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> formed the nucleus of the population. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> protested, and in 1149 a satisfactory agreement was concluded. Notwithstanding the sufferings of Montauban during the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, it grew rapidly. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Salvator" (25 June, 1317), separated from the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Narbonne, the See of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, made it an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, and gave it as suffragans four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> created within its territory: Montauban, St.-Papoul, Rieux, Lombez. Bertrand de Puy, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> at Montauriol, was first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Montauban. Montauban counts among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Cardinal Georges d'Amboise (1484-1491), minister of Louis XII, and Jean de Lettes (1539-1556), who married and became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. Despite the resistance of Jacques des Pr&eacute;s-Montpezat (1556-1589), a nephew of Jean de Lettes who succeeded him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> became masters of the city; in 1561 they interdicted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship; the destruction of the churches, and even of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was begun and carried on until 1567. In 1570 Montauban became one of the four strongholds granted the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and in 1578, 1579, and 1584 harboured the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held by the d&eacute;put&eacute;s of the Reformed Churches of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. For a short time, in 1600, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship was re-established but was soon suppressed; Bishop Anne Carrion de Murviel (1600-1652) withdrew to Montech during the greater part of his reign and administered thence the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Montauban. In spite of the unsuccessful siege of Montauban by Louis XIII (August-November, 1621), the fall of <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a> (1629) entailed the submission of the city, and <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> entered it on 20 August, 1629. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of note were: Le Tonnellier de Breteuil (1762-1794), who died during the Reign of Terror in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, after converting the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> La Harpe to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; the future <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cardinal de Cheverus</a>, 1824-26.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Moissac, whose portal built in 1107 is a veritable museum of Romanesque <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, deserves notice; its <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> (1100-1108) is one of the most remarkable in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Legend attributes to <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> the foundation of the Abbey of Moissac in 506, but St. Amand (594-675) seems to have been the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> grew, and in a few years its possessions extended to the gates of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. The threats and incursions of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> brought the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Moissac to elect "knight <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>" who were <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and whose mission was to defend them. From the tenth to the thirteenth century several of the counts of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> were knight-abbots of Moissac; the death of Alfonso II (1271) made the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the legitimate successor of the counts of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and in this way the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> came to depend directly on the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, henceforth its "knight-abbots". Some of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: St. Ausbert (663-678); St. L&eacute;otadius (678-691); St. Paternus (691-718); St. Amarandus (718-720). The union of Moissac with Cluny was begun by Abbot Stephen as early as 1047, and completed in 1063 under Abbot Durand. Four filial <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and numerous <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> depended on the Abbey of Moissac. Among the commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were Louis of Lorraine, Cardinal de <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guise</a> (1556-1578); Charles of Lorraine, the Cardinal de Vaudemont (1578-1590). In 1618 Moissac was transformed into a collegiate church which had, among other titulars, <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Cardinal Mazarin</a> (1644-1661), and Cardinal de Lom&eacute;nie de Brienne, minister of Louis XVI (1775-1788). On 25 July, 1523, fifteen inhabitants of Moissac, after they had made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Compostella, grouped themselves into a confraternity "&agrave; l'honneur de Dieu, de Notre Dame et Monseigneur Saint Jacques". This confraternity, reorganized in 1615 by letters patent of Louis XIII, existed for many years. As late as 1830 "pilgrims" were still seen in the Moissac processions. In fact Moissac and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> were long closely united; a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Moissac, St. G&eacute;rault, was <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> from 1095 to 1109. The general synod of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> held at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>, in May, 1598, decided on the creation of an academy at Montauban; it was opened in 1600, was exclusively <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and gathered students from other countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In 1632 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> established themselves at Montauban, but in 1659 transferred the Academy to Puylaurens. In 1808 a faculty of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> was created at Montauban and still exists.

<p>The principal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre Dame de Livron or de la D&eacute;liverance, visited by Blanche of Castille and Louis XIII; Notre Dame de Lorm, at Castelferrus, dating from the fifteenth century; Notre Dame de la Peyrouse, near Lafran&ccedil;aise. Before the application of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 as to associations, the diocese counted <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, Marianists, and various orders of School Brothers. Among the congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> which originated in the diocese we mention: <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, hospitallers and teachers, founded in 1804 (mother-house at Moissac); Sisters of the Guardian Angel, hospitallers and teachers, founded in 1839 at Quillan in the <a href="../cathen/03331b.htm">Diocese of Carcassonne</a> by P&egrave;re Deshayes, Superior of the <a href="../cathen/15668a.htm">Daughters of Wisdom</a>, whose mother-house was transferred to the ch&acirc;teau of La Molle, near Montauban in 1858. At the beginning of the twentieth century the religious congregations had charge of: 1 cr&egrave;che, 24 day nurseries, 10 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 1 refuge (<em>&oelig;uvre de r&eacute;habilitation</em>), 2 houses for the relief of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, 11 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or asylums, 30 houses for the care of the sick in their own homes. In 1908 the Diocese of Montauban counted 188,563 inhabitants, of whom 7000 were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; 31 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 296 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 58 vicariates.
