<h1>Diocese of Newport in England</h1>  

<p>(NEOPORTENSIS)

<p>This diocese takes its name from Newport, a town of about 70,000 inhabitants, situated at the mouth of the river Usk, in the county of Monmouth. Before the <a href="../cathen/16037d.htm">restoration of hierarchial government in England</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1850, the old "Western District" of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had, since 1840, been divided into two vicariates. The northern, comprising the twelve counties of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> with Monmouthshire and Herefordshire, was called the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. When the country was divided by an <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Apostolic Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 29 Sept., 1850, into <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the six counties of South <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, with Monmouthshire and Herefordshire, became the Diocese of Newport in England and <a href="../cathen/10187d.htm">Menevia</a>. Menevia is the Latin name for St. David's, and the double title was intended to signify that at some future day there were to be two distinct <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Diocese of Newport in England and Menevia was the Right Reverend Thomas Joseph Brown, O.S.B., who had already, as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, ruled for ten years the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. A further re-adjustment of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was made in March, 1895, when <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> separated from it five of the counties of South <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and formed a new vicariate, which was to consist of all the twelve <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> counties except Glamorganshire. Since that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the name of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has been simply "Newport", and it has consisted of Glamorganshire, Monmouthshire, and Herefordshire. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population (1910) is about 45,000, the general population being about 1,050,000.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chapter, in virtue of a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>, 21 April, 1852, issued at the petition of <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, was to consist of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation resident in the town of Newport. As the congregation, up to this date (1910), have not been able to establish a house in Newport, permission from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has been obtained for the members of the chapter to reside at St. Michael's pro-cathedral, Belmont, near <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>. The chapter comprises a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> prior and nine canons, of whom four are allowed to be non-resident. Their choral habit the <em>cuculla</em> or frock of the congregation with a special almuce. In assisting the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> they dispense with the <em>cuculla</em>, and wear the almuce over the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Right Reverend John Cuthbert Hedley, O.S.B., was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as auxiliary on 29 September, 1873, and succeeded in February, 1881, to Bishop Brown. He resides at Bishop's House, Llanishen, Cardiff. The pro-cathedral is the beautiful church of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> at Belmont. There are in the diocese about 40 secular <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 21 <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> (of whom 15 work on the Mission), and 14 <a href="../cathen/13198a.htm">Rosminian Fathers</a>, There are five deaneries. The principal towns are Cardiff, Newport, Swansea, and Merthyr Tydvil. The only <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious house</a> of men is the Cathedral Priory, Belmont, which is the residence of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> prior and chapter, and is also a house of studies and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. Of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> there are houses of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, Our Lady of Charity, the Good Shepherd, Sisters of Nazareth, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> of Chavagnes, St. Joseph of <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a>, <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and others. There are four certified Poor Law <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>: one for boys, at Treforest, and three for girls &mdash; two, at <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a> and Bullingham respectively, conducted by the Sisters of Charity, one at Cardiff, conducted by the Sisters of Nazareth. There are 50 churches in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, besides several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and public <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>. There are about 11,000 children in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. There are four secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls, and one centre (in Carduff) for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> pupil teachers.
