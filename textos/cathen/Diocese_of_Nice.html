<h1>Diocese of Nice</h1>  

<p>(NICIENSIS)

<p>Nice comprises the Department of Alpes-Maritimes. It was re-established by the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> as suffragan of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>. The Countship of Nice from 1818 to 1860 was part of the <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinian</a> States, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> became a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. When Nice was annexed to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1860, certain parts which remained Italian were cut off from it and added to the Diocese of Vintimille. In 1862 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was again a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>. The arrondissement of Grasse was separated from the <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Diocese of Fr&eacute;jus</a> in 1886, and given to Nice which now unites the three former Dioceses of Nice, Grasse, and Vence.
<h2 id="section1">Diocese of Nice</h2>

<p>Traditions tell us that Nice was evangelized by <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">St. Barnabas</a>, sent by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, or else by <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a>, St. Martha, and St. Lazarus; and they make St. Bassus, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nice. The See of Nice in Gaul existed in 314, since the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sent delegates to the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> in that year. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> historically known is Amantius who attended the Council of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> in 381. Cimiez, near Nice, where still can be seen the remains of a Roman amphitheatre, and which was made illustrious by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the youthful St. Pontius about 260 had also a see, held in the middle of the fifth century by St. Valerianus; a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a>, issued after 450 and confirmed by St. Hilarus in 465, united the Sees of Nice and Cimiez. This newly-formed see remained a suffragan of Embrun up to the time of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06378a.htm">DIOCESE OF GAP</a>). Mgr Duchesne has not discovered sufficient historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the episcopate at Nice of St. Valerianus (433-43), of St. Deutherius (490-93), <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, of St. Syagrius (died 787), Count of Brignoles and son-in-law perhaps of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, a former <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of L&eacute;rins, is mentioned as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nice (1100-07). Bishops of Nice bore the title of Counts of Drap since the donation of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> situated at Drap, made in 1073 by Pierre, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a>, a native of Nice, to Raymond I, its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and to his successors. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, when visiting Cimiez devastated by the Lombards in 574, caused St. Syagrius to build on its ruins the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Pontius, the largest Alpine abbey of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Diocese of Grasse</h2>

<p>The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Antibes is Armentarius who attended the Council of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a> in 442; Mgr Duchesne admits as possible that the Remigius, who signed at the Council of <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a> in 396 and in 417 received a letter from <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a>, may have been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Antibes before Armentarius. About the middle of the thirteenth century the See of Antibes was transferred to Grasse. Bishops of Grasse worthy of mention are: Cardinal Agostino Trivulzio (1537-1648); the poet Antoine Godeau (1636-53), one of the most celebrated habitu&eacute;s of the H&ocirc;tel de Rambouillet, where he was nicknamed "Julia's dwarf" on account of his small stature.
<h2 id="section3">Diocese of Vence</h2>

<p>The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vence is Severus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 439 and perhaps as early as 419. Among others are: St. Veranus, son of <a href="../cathen/05595a.htm">St. Eucherius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of L&eacute;rins, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> before 451 and at least until 465; <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a>, first a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> (died 1154); Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1505-11). Antoine Godeau, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Grasse, was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vence in 1638; the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> wished to unite the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Meeting with opposition from the chapter and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Vence Godeau left Grasse in 1653, to remain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vence, which see he held until 1672.

<p>The following <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are specially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the Diocese of Nice: The youthful <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> St. Celsus, whom certain traditions make victim of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; St. Vincentius and St. Orontius, natives of Cimiez, apostles of Aquitaine and of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>; <a href="../cathen/07489a.htm">St. Hospitius</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> of Cap Ferrat (died about 581); Blessed Antoine* Gallus (1300-92), a native of Nice, one of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena's</a> confessors. The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> St. Reparata of C&aelig;sarea in Palestine is the patroness of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Our Lady of Laghet, near <a href="../cathen/10447a.htm">Monaco</a>, a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> since the end of the seventeenth century; the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Sacred Heart of Jesus at Roquefort near Grasse; Our Lady of Valcluse; Our Lady of Brusq; Our Lady of Vie. Prior to the application of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 against associations, the diocese counted <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of the Immaculate Conception, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Priests of the Christian Doctrine, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a> of Dom Bosco, Camillians, several orders of teaching <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">Brothers</a>. The Sisters of St. Martha, devoted to teaching and nursing and founded in 1832, have their mother-house at Grasse. At the beginning of the twentieth century religious congregations of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> conducted 4 cr&egrave;ches, 16 day nurseries, 2 institutions for crippled children, 1 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, 10 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 3 sewing rooms, 11 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or asylums, 4 convalescent homes, 6 houses for the care of the sick in their own homes, 1 insane asylum, 1 asylum for incurables. The Diocese of Nice, whither every year the warm and balmy climate of the C&ocirc;te d'Azur attracts innumerable foreigners, counted in 1909 about 260,000 inhabitants, 32 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 185 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>.
