<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Diocese of Ogdensburg</h1>  

<p>(Ogdensburgdensis).

<p>Comprises the northern towns of Herkimer and Hamilton counties, with the counties of Lewis, Jefferson, <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, Franklin, Clinton, and Essex in New York. On the north and east it is bounded by <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and Vermont and by Lake Ontario on the west. It covers 12,036 square miles, to a great extent occupied by the wooded wilderness of the Adirondack Mountains which, however, of late is rapidly opening up for summer resorts and tuberculosis sanatoria. The soil is mostly rocky and sandy and it supports but a relatively small population which is decreasing in the rural districts, but slowly increasing in industrial and iron mining centres.

<p>The territory was formerly the scene of frequent bloody conflicts between the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> and <a href="../cathen/01311b.htm">Algonquins</a>, and also between the French and the British. In 1749 the Sulpician, <a href="../cathen/12075d.htm">Francis Picquet</a>, established on the banks of the St. Lawrence, where Ogdensburg now is located, the Fort of the Presentation, to protect the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Mohawks, who were, however, scattered by the English ten years later. There is still a reservation called St. Regis, part in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (with about 2000 Indians), partly in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a> (with about 1200), where the descendants of the former savage tribes of the country, <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">Christianized</a> in the seventeenth century and still nearly all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, worship together and sing the choral part of the Divine services in <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>. The first white settlers were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> from New England. It was only towards 1790 that <a href="../cathen/01090a.htm">Acadian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigrants occupied lands around Corbeau, now Coopersville, near Lake Champlain, where they were occasionally visited by missionaries from Fort La Prarie, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. In 1818, a colony of French and German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was brought to Jefferson County by Count Leray de Chaumont, who built for them, and also for an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> settlement, several <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches. At the same time <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> immigrants began to arrive and soon there arose <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions in various parts of the future diocese which still belonged to New York.

<p>The first congregations were formed at Ogdensburg in 1827 by Father Salmon, at Carthage by Father Patrick Kelly, at Coopersville in 1818 by Father Mignault, at Plattsburg in 1828 by Father Patrick McGilligan, at Hogansburg in 1836 by Rev. John McNulty. Bishops Dubois, Hughes, and McCloskey visited these <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and others that were arising in the lumbering and mining districts of the region. After the Papineau rebellion in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (1838) many <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> settled on American soil, and soon after the famine brought thousands of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> emigrants into the territory. Bishop Hughes erected in 1838 a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Lafargeville near Clayton; but it was transferred in 1840 to <a href="../cathen/15203b.htm">Fordham</a> near New York. The <a href="../cathen/14334a.htm">Catholic Summer School of America</a>, commenced at New London in 1892, was in 1893 definitely located at Plattsburg and has met with great success. It is a place of learning and recreation for thousands of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the surrounding country. Attendance at its courses procures teaching diplomas in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was separated from the <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Diocese of Albany</a> on 15 February, 1872. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the Rt. Rev. Edgar P. Wadhams, b. 1817 at Lewis, Essex County. He was a convert from the Episcopalian Church, in which he had been a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, when called to organize Northern New York into a new diocese. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a> on 5 May 1872, by <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, McCloskey. Bishop Wadhams increased the number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and introduced several <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities; he founded <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and erected an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, and an aged people's home. At his death, 5 December, 1891, the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> had increased from 65 to 125; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from 42 to 81; <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> from 23 to 129 and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> from 7 to 20; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population had risen from 50,000 to 65,000.

<p>Bishop Wadhams attended the New York <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of 1883 and the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> of 1884, and held three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. His remains are buried in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of St. Mary's Cathedral which he had enlarged and embellished.

<p>Henry Gabriels, born at Wannegem-Lede, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, on 6 October 1838, graduated at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Diocese of Ghent</a> and was invited with three other <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to teach in the newly-founded provincial <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Troy, New York. He was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and afterwards was professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> until 1891. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a> on 5 May 1892 by <a href="../cathen/04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> developed the work begun by his predecessor. He strengthened the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> although some of the smaller ones had to be closed; he introduced four new <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. Bishop Gabriels has made two visits <em>ad limina</em>, besides other trips to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The former elements of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, French and German, must for permanency rely on their own fecundity. There are a reasonable number of conversions annually, but a new immigration of Poles, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarians</a>, Greeks, <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, and others, largely threatens to modify the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body. Yet till now none are numerous enough to form separate congregations except the Poles who are building a church in Mineville.
