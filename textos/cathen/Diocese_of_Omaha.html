<h1>Diocese of Omaha</h1>  

<p>(OMAHENSIS)

<p>The Diocese embraces all that part of the State of Nebraska north of the southern shore of the South Platte River. Area, 52,996 sq. miles.
<h2>Early missionaries</h2>

<p>The first missionaries in Nebraska were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, who, from about 1838, occasionally visited the native Indians, many of whom received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. In 1851 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> cut off from the Diocese of St. Louis all the country north from the south line of <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a> to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and west from the Missouri River to the Rocky Mountains, and erected it into the Vicariate of the Rocky Mountains, with Rt. Rev. John B. Mi&egrave;ge, S.J., as first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09102b.htm">LEAVENWORTH</a>). On 6 January, 1857, this vicariate was again divided, and a new vicariate called the Vicariate of Nebraska was erected, Bishop Mi&egrave;ge being authorized to govern it until the appointment of a resident <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Nebraska.

<p>The first resident <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> was the Right Rev. James Miles O'Gorman, D.D., born near Nenagh, Co. Tipperary, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1804, took the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> habit at Mount Melleray, Co. Waterford, 1 Nov., 1839, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 1843. He was one of the band who came to <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, in 1849 to establish New Melleray (see <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">CISTERCIANS</a>). In 1859 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Nebraska, and on 8 May of the same year was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Raphanea by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> of St. Louis. The vicariate at this time embraced the present <a href="../cathen/10729b.htm">State of Nebraska</a>, the Dakotas west of the Missouri River, <a href="../cathen/15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a> east of the Rocky Mountains. On his arrival at Omaha Bishop O'Gorman found in his vast <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> a catholic population of some three hundred <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of white settlers living along the river counties, and a few thousand Indians, chiefly in <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>. There were in the entire territory, two seculars, and one <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a> in charge of the native tribes.

<p>During the fifteen years of his episcopate Bishop O'Gorman laboured to provide for the needs of his scattered flock. He placed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the more important centres of population, and in the sixties, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the vicariate ministered to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Western <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>. During his administration the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> were established at Omaha, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> in Nebraska City, and the Sisters of Charity in <a href="../cathen/07203a.htm">Helena</a>, <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>. At his death (4 July, 1874) his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> contained 19 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 20 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 11,722.

<p>The second <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> was the Right Rev. James O'Connor, D.D., born at Queenstown, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 10 Sept., 1823. At the age of fifteen he came to America. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at St. Charles's Seminary, Philadelphia, and in the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1848. The following year he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Michael's Seminary, <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburgh</a>, and in 1862 <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Charles's Seminary, Overbrook, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. In 1872 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Dominic's Church, Holmesburg, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. In 1876 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Nebraska, and on 20 August of the same year he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dibona by Bishop Ryan of St. Louis. During his episcopate the vicariate developed with wonderful rapidity. The construction of the Union Pacific Railway in 1867, and more especially the extension of the Burlington Railway in the seventies and eighties, opened up Nebraska to colonists, and white settlers began to pour in from the Eastern states. It became the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the new vicar to provide for the growing needs of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and the yearly statistics of the vicariate show how successful were his labours. In 1880 the Dakotas were erected into a vicariate, and on 7 April, 1887, <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a> was cut off.
<h2>Diocese of Omaha</h2>

<p>On 2 October, 1885, the vicariate was erected into the Diocese of Omaha, and Bishop O'Connor was appointed its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The new diocese embraced the present States of Nebraska and <a href="../cathen/15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>. On 2 August, 1887, the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/03651a.htm">Cheyenne</a> and Lincoln were erected, leaving Omaha its present boundaries. Through the generosity of the Creighton <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, Bishop O'Connor was enabled to erect a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> free day college in the city of Omaha. On its completion in 1879, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who held the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in trust, deeded over the institution to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, who are since in charge and hold the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> as trustees (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/04480a.htm">CREIGHTON UNIVERSITY</a>). Bishop O'Connor also introduced into his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers, the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, the Religious of the Sacred Heart, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, and the Sisters of Providence. A most important work in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> life was the foundation, in conjunction with Miss Catherine Drexel, of the <a href="../cathen/02599a.htm">Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament</a>, in 1889 (see <a href="../cathen/02599a.htm">SISTERS OF THE BLESSED SACRAMENT</a>; also "Indian Sentinel", 1907). Bishop O'Connor also helped to establish a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colony in Greeley Co., and (1889) the Cath. Mutual Relief Soc. of America.

<p>The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the Right Rev. Richard Scanneli, D.D., born in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of <a href="../cathen/04072a.htm">Cloyne</a>, Co. <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 12 May, 1845. Having completed his classical studies in a private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Midleton, in 1866 he entered All Hallows College, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 26 Feb., 1871. In the same year he came to the <a href="../cathen/10704c.htm">Diocese of Nashville</a> and was appointed assistant at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1878 he became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Columba's Church, East Nashville, and in 1879 <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. From 1880 to 1883 he was administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <em>sede vacante</em>. In 1885 he organized St. Joseph's parish in West Nashville and built its church. The following year he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and on 30 Nov., 1887, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a> by Archbishop Feehan.

<p>On 30 January, 1891, he was transferred to Omaha. During his administration the diocese shows the same wonderful growth that characterized this territory in the time of his predecessors. Parishes, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and academies have more than doubled in number. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have increased from 58 to 144, and the religious from 23 to 37. The old frame churches are fast being replaced by structures of brick and stone, and a fine <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the Spanish style of architecture is in process of erection. The Creighton Memorial St. Joseph's Hospital, costing over half a million dollars, has been erected, and a new <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> &mdash; St. Catherine's &mdash; has just been opened, a home of the Good Shepherd has been established, and <a href="../cathen/04480a.htm">Creighton University</a> has been many times enlarged. Bishop Scanneli introduced the following orders: (men) the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> Regular of St. Francis, who conduct a flourishing college; (women) the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, of the Presentation, of the Resurrection, of St. Benedict, of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, of the Good Shepherd, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Felicians, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>.
<h2>Pioneer priests</h2>

<p>Fathers Kelly, Daxacher, Hartig, Ryan, Cannon, Powers, Erlach, Curtis, Hayes, Byrne, Groenebaum, Uhing, Lechleitner. The following filled the office of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> or administrator: &mdash; Very Rev. Fathers Kelley, Curtis, Byrne, Choka, and Rt. Rev. Mgr Colaneri, the present <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and chancellor.
