<h1>Diocese of Orense</h1>  

<p>(AURIENSIS)

<p>A suffragan of <a href="../cathen/04187b.htm">Compostela</a>, includes nearly all of the civil Province of Orense, and part of those of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a> and Zamora, being bounded on the north by Pontevedra, <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a>, and Leon; on the east by Leon and Zamora; on the south by <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>; on the west by <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and Pontevedra. Its capital, Orense (pop., 14,168), is a very ancient city on the banks of the Mi&ntilde;o (Minho), famous since classical antiquity for its hot springs. The See of Orense dates from a remote period, certainly before the fifth century. The First Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (561) created four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of which afterwards signed the acts of the Second Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> below the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Orense &mdash; an indication that they were of junior standing. Moreover, the signatures of the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/15105a.htm">Tuy</a> and Astorga, two very ancient Churches, come after that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Orense. According to Idacius, two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Pastor and Siagrius, were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a> in 433, and one of them (it is not known which) was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Orense.

<p>In 464, the Suevians, who had invaded Galicia embraced <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, and only in the time of King Chararic (560) were they reconciled to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> tells us that the Galiciana embraced the Faith with remarkable fervour. The conversion and instruction of both king and people appear to have been completed by St. Martin of Dumium. The names of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Orense are unknown until 571, when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was governed by Witimir, a man of noble Suevian lineage, who assisted at the Second Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>. He was an intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/09731b.htm">St. Martin of Braga</a>, who dedicated to him as his "most dear father in Christ" his treatise "De ira". In 716 Orense was destroyed by Abdelaziz son of Muza. In 832 Alfonso II combined the two Dioceses of Orense and Lugo: Orense, nevertheless, appears to have retained its <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, for a charter of Alfonso the Chaste is witnessed by Maydo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Orense. When Alfonso III (866-910) had reconquered Orense, he gave it to Bishop Sebastian, who had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arcabica in Celtiberia and was succeeded by Censerio (844), Sumna (886), and Egila (899), who took part in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the church of Santiago and in the Council of <a href="../cathen/11363a.htm">Oviedo</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> of Ansurius (915-22) the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> Franquila (906) erected the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Esteban de Ribas del Sil (St. Stephen on the Sil), where Ansurius himself and eight of his successors died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>.

<p>At the end of the tenth century the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was laid waste, first by the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> (970) and then by Almanzor, after which it was committed to the care of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a> until 1071, when after a vacancy of seventy years, Sancho II appointed Ederonio to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Ederonio rebuilt the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> called S. Maria la Madre (1084-89). The most famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this period was Diego Velasco, whom his epitaph calls "light of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and glory of his country". He assisted at a council of <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a> and three councils of Santiago, and, with the assent of Do&ntilde;a Urraca and her son Alfonso, granted privileges (<em>fueros</em>) to Orense. He ruled for thirty years and was succeeded by Martin (1132-56) and Pedro Segu&iacute;n. The latter was confessor to Ferdinand II, who granted him the lordship of Orense. Bishop Lorenzo was the jurist whom Tudense called the "pattern of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>" (<em>regla del derecho</em>); he rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace, and constructed the famous bridge of Orense, with its principal arch spanning more than 130 feet. He assisted at the Council of Lyons in 1245. Va&ntilde;ez de Novoa quarrelled with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, while he was precentor, and burned their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, which had sheltered one of his enemies, but, having become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he rebuilt it magnificently. Vasco Perez Mari&ntilde;o (1333-43) was distinguished for his devotion to the "Holy Christ of Orense", which he caused to be transferred from Finisterre to Orense and built for it a beautiful <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, modified in subsequent periods. Other distinguished occupants of this see were Cardinal Juan de Torquemada, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, who assisted at the Councils of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and Basle; Diego de Fonseca (1471-84), who repaired the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Cardinals Antoniotto Pallavicino and Pedro de Isvalles, and the inquisitor general Fernando Vald&eacute;s. Francisco Blanco founded the Hospital of S. Roque, assisted at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, founded the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> at <a href="../cathen/09565b.htm">Malaga</a> and Compostela, and endowed that at Monterey. The Zealous Juan Mu&ntilde;oz de la Cueva, a Trinitarian, wrote "Historical Notes on the Cathedral Church of Orense" (Madrid, 1727). Pedro Quevedo y Quintana (died 1818), having been president of the Regency in 1810, was exiled by the Cortes of <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz</a>; he founded the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Orense in 1802.

<p>The original <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, and is still known as Santa Maria la Madre. The Suevian king Chararic (see above) built (550) another, more sumptuous, church in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a> and made it the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as it is to this day. Both churches, having suffered severely from time and the invasions of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> and <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a>, have been repeatedly restored. The later <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is Romanesque, with features of Gothic transition: its oldest portions date from the thirteenth century, and its latest from the early sixteenth; the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> has been rebuilt in modern times. The <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> has a silver tabernacle, given by Bishop Miguel Ares, and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and St. Martin. In two side altars are the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Euphemia and her companions in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, Sts. Facundus and Primitivus. The plan of the church is a Latin cross, with three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, the tower standing apart. The choir stalls are the work of Diego de Soils and Juan de Auges (late sixteenth century). Of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> only a small portion remains, a perfect gem of ogival work. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Francis and the Trinity should also be mentioned; it was founded probably about the middle of the twelfth century as a hospice for <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>.

<p>The famous men of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> include Padre Feij&oacute;o, a polygrapher who exploded many <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>; Antonio de Remesar, the historian of Chiapa and <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>; Gregorio Hernandez, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>; Castellar Ferrer, the historian of Galicia; St. Francis Blanco, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>.
