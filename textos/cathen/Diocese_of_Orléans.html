<h1>Diocese of Orl&eacute;ans</h1>  

<p>(AURELIANUM)

<p>This Diocese comprises the Department of Loiret, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> since 1622, previously of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> it was re-established by the Concordat of 1802, when it included the Departments of Loiret and Loir et Cher, but in 1822 Loir et Cher was included in the new <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Diocese of Blois</a>. The present Diocese of Orl&eacute;ans differs considerably from that of the old regime; it has lost the arrondissement of Romorantin which has passed to the <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Diocese of Blois</a> and the canton of Janville, now in the <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Diocese of Chartres</a>. It includes the arrondissement of Montargis, formerly subject to <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, the arrondissement of Gien, once in the Diocese of Auxerre, and the canton de Ch&acirc;tillon sur Loire, once belonging to Bourges. To Gerbert, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Pierre le Vif at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> (1046-79), is due a detailed narrative according to which Saints Savinianus and Potentianus were sent to Sens by St. Peter with St. Altirius; the latter, it was said, came to Orl&eacute;ans as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Before the ninth century there is no historical trace in the <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Diocese of Sens</a> of this Apostolic mission of St. Altinus, nor in the Diocese of Orl&eacute;ans before the end of the fifteenth. Diclopitus is the first authentic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; he figures among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul who (about 344) ratified the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the early period are: St. Euvertius, about 355 to 385, according to M. Cuissard; St. Aignan (Anianus) (385-453), who invoked the aid of the "patrician" &AElig;tius against the invasion of <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a>, and forced the Huns to raise the siege of Orl&eacute;ans; St. Prosper (453-63); St. Monitor (about 472); St. Flou (Flosculus), died in 490; <a href="../cathen/05595a.htm">St. Eucherius</a> (717-43), native of Orl&eacute;ans and a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Jumi&egrave;ges, who protested against the depredations of Waifre, a companion of <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, and was exiled to Cologne by this prince, then to <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, and died at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Trond.

<p>Of the eighth-century <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Theodulfus was notable. It is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when he began to govern, but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he was already <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 798, when <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> sent him into Narbonne and Provence as <em>missus dominicus</em>. Under Louis le D&eacute;bonnaire he was accused of aiding the rebellious King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was deposed and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> four years in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, but was released when Louis came to Angers in 821. The "Capitularies" which Theodulfus addressed to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Orl&eacute;ans are considered a most important monument of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. His Ritual, his Penitential, his treatise on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, confirmation, and the Eucharist, his edition of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, a work of fine penmanship preserved in the Puy <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, reveal him as one of the foremost men of his time (see P.L., CV, 187). His fame rests chiefly on his devotion to the spread of learning. The Abbey of Ferri&egrave;res was then becoming under <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> a centre of learning. Theodulfus opened the Abbey of Fleury to the young noblemen sent thither by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, invited the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to establish free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the country districts, and quoted for them, "These that are learned shall shine as the brightness of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>: and they that instruct many to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as stars to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>" (<a href="../bible/dan012.htm#vrs3">Daniel 12:3</a>). One monument of his time still survives in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the church of Germigny modelled after the imperial <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and yet retaining its unique <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> decoration. Other noteworthy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are: Jonas (821-43), who wrote a treatise against the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a>, also a treatise on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life and a book on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of kings (for these texts see P.L., CVI, 117); St. Thierry II (1016-21); Blessed Philip Berruyer (1234-6); Blessed Roger le Fort (1321-8); Cardinal Jean de Longueville (1521-33), who received Queen Eleanor, sister of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Orl&eacute;ans, and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">King Francis I</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Aignan of Orl&eacute;ans; Cardinal Antoine* Sanguin (1534-52), who received <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> at Orl&eacute;ans in 1539; Bernier (1802-6); Fayer (1843-9), member of the Constituent Assembly of 1848; <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Dupanloup</a> (1849-78). For the Abbeys of Fleury and Ferri&egrave;res see FLEURY and <a href="../cathen/06049d.htm">FERRI&Egrave;RES</a>.

<p>After his victory over the Alamanni, <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> was bent on the sack of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> there obtained mercy for his fellow-citizens. To St. Euspicius and his nephew St. Mesmin (Maximinus), <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> also gave the domain of Micy, near Orl&eacute;ans at the confluence of the Loire and the Loiret, for a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (508). When Euspicius died, <a href="../cathen/10077a.htm">St. Maximinus</a> became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and during his rule the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> flourished there notably, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> counted many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. From Micy monastic life spread. St. Liphardus and St. Urbicius founded the Abbey of Meung-sur-Loire; St. Ly&eacute; (L&aelig;tus) died a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> in the forest of Orl&eacute;ans; St. Viatre (Viator) in Sologne; St. Doulchard in the forest of Ambly near Bourges. St. Leonard introduced the monastic life into the territory of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>; St. Almir, St. Ulphacius, and St. Bomer in the vicinity of Montmirail; <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a> (died about 527) in the district of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>; St. Calais (died before 536) and St. Leonard of Vend&oelig;uvre (died about 570) in the valley of the Sarthe; St. Fraimbault and St. Constantine in the Javron forest, and the aforesaid St. Bomer (died about 560) in the Passais near Laval; St. Leonard of Dunois; St. Alva and St. Ernier in Perche; St. Laumer (died about 590) became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Corbion. St. Lubin (Leobinus), a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Micy, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> from 544-56. Finally Ay (Agilus), Viscount of Orl&eacute;ans (died after 587), a protector of Micy, was also a saint. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Micy contributed much to the civilization of the Orl&eacute;ans region; they cleared and drained the lands and taught the semi-barbarous inhabitants the worth and dignity of agricultural work. Early in the eighth century, Theodulfus restored the Abbey of Micy and at his request <a href="../cathen/02467a.htm">St. Benedict of Aniane</a> sent fourteen <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and visited the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> himself. The last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Micy, Chapt de Rastignac, was one of the victims of the "September Massacres", at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1792, in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of L'Abbaye.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Orl&eacute;ans early acquired great prestige; in the sixth century Gontran, King of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, had his son Gondebaud <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> there. After Theodolfus had developed and improved the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a>, sent thither their eldest sons as pupils. These institutions were at the height of their fame from the eleventh century to the middle of the thirteenth. Their influence spread as far as <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> whence students came to them. Among the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> rhetorical treatises which have come down to us under the title of "Ars" or "Summa Dictaminis" four, at least, were written or re-edited by Orl&eacute;ans professors. In 1230, when for a time the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> were scattered, a number of the teachers and disciples took refuge in Orl&eacute;ans; when <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, in 1298, <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the sixth book of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, he appointed the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of Bologna and the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of Orl&eacute;ans to comment upon it. <a href="../cathen/08256b.htm">St. Yves</a> (1253-1303) studied <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> at Orl&eacute;ans, and <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> also studied there law and letters; by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> published at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 27 January, 1306, he endowed the Orl&eacute;ans institutes with the title and privileges of a University. Twelve of his successors granted the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> many privileges. In the fourteenth century it had as many as five thousand students from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, Champagne, Picardy, <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, Touraine, Guyan, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. Among those who studied or lectured there are quoted: in the fourteenth century, Cardinal Pierre Bertrandi; in the fifteenth, John Reuchlin; in the sixteenth, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> and Th&eacute;odore de B&egrave;ze, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Anne Dubourg, the publicist Fran&ccedil;ois Hotmann, the jurisconsult Pierre de l'Etoile; in the seventeenth, <a href="../cathen/10434b.htm">Moli&egrave;re</a> (perhaps in 1640), and the savant <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a>; in the eighteenth, the jurisconsult Pothier.

<p>Among the notabg<a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: St. Baudilus, a N&icirc;mes <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (third or fourth century); the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> St. Lucanus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, patron of Loigny (fifth century); the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a> St. Donatus (fifth century); St. May, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Val Beno&icirc;t (fifth century); St. Mesme, virgin and (perhaps) <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, sister of St. Mesmin (sixth century); St. Felicule, patroness of Gien (sixth century); St. Sigismund, King of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, who, by order of the Merovingian, Clodomir, and despite the entreaties of <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a>, was thrown (524) into a well with his wife and children; St. Gontran, King of Orl&eacute;ans and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> (561-93), a confessor; St. Loup (Lupus), <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, born near Orl&eacute;ans, and his mother St. Agia (first half of the seventh century); St. Gregory, former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nicopolis, in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, who died a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> at Pithiviers (1004 or 1007); St. Rose, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Ervauville (died 1130); Blessed Odo of Orl&eacute;ans, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> (1105-13); the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> St. Alpaix, died in 1211 at Cudot where she was visited by Alix of Champagne, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Louis VII; St. Guillaume (died 1209), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fontainejean and subsequently <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Blessed Reginald, dean of the collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Aignan, Orl&eacute;ans (died 1220); the Englishman St. Richard, who studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Orl&eacute;ans in 1236, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03657a.htm">Chichester</a> in 1244, a friend of St. Edmund of Canterbury; <a href="../cathen/10072a.htm">St. Maurus</a>, called to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by St. Innocent, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Mans</a>, and sent thither by St. Benedict; resided at Orl&eacute;ans with four companions in 542; St. Radegonde, on her way from Noyon to Poitiers in 544, and St. Columbanus, exiled from Luxeuil at the close of the sixth century, both visited Orl&eacute;ans. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> had the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Aignan rebuilt and reconstructed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Pierre le Puellier. In the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Orl&eacute;ans on 31 December, 987, <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a> had his son Robert (born at Orl&eacute;ans) <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> king. <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> and <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> visited Fleury and Orl&eacute;ans in 1130.

<p>The people of Orl&eacute;ans were so impressed by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/13096a.htm">Blessed Robert of Arbrissel</a> in 1113 that he was invited to found the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of La Madeleine, which he re-visited in 1117 with St. Bernard of Thiron. The charitable deeds of St. Louis at Puiseaux, Ch&acirc;teauneuf-sur-Loire, and Orl&eacute;ans, where he was present at the translation of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Aignan (26 October, 1259), and where he frequently went to care for the poor of the H&ocirc;tel Dieu, are well known. Pierre de Beaufort, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Sully and canon of Orl&eacute;ans, as <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> (1371-8), was the last <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; he created Cardinal Jean de la Tour d'Auvergne, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Beno&icirc;t-sur Loire. Blessed Jeanne de Valois was Duchess of Orl&eacute;ans and after her separation from Louis XII (1498) she established, early in the sixteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of L'Annonciade at Ch&acirc;teauneuf-sur-Loire. Etienne Dolet (1509-46), a printer, philologian, and pamphleteer, executed at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and looked upon by some as a "martyr of the Renaissance", was a native of Orl&eacute;ans. Cardinal Odet de Coligny, who joined the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> about 1560, was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Euvertius, of Fontainejean, Ferri&egrave;res, and St. Beno&icirc;t. Admiral Coligny (1519-72) (see <a href="../cathen/13333b.htm">SAINT BARTHOLOMEW'S DAY</a>) was born at Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Loing in the present diocese. At the beginning of the religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> Orl&eacute;ans was disputed between the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guises</a> and the followers of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Cond&eacute;. In the vicinity of Orl&eacute;ans Duke Francis of <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guise</a> was assassinated 3 February, 1562.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>, Jacques Bongars, councillor of Henry IV, who collected and edited the chronicles of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> in his "Gesta Dei per Francos", was born at Orl&eacute;ans in 1554. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Denis Petav (Petavius)</a>, a renowned scholar and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, was born at Orl&eacute;ans in 1583. St. Francis of Sales came to Orl&eacute;ans in 1618 and 1619. Venerable Mother Fran&ccedil;oise de la Croix (1591-1657), a pupil of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, who founded the congregation of Augustinian Sisters of Charity of Notre Dame, was born at Petay in the diocese. The Miramion <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to which Marie Bonneau is celebrated in the annals of charity under the name of Mme de Miramion (1629-96), belonged by marriage, were from Orl&eacute;ans. St. Jane de Chantal was superior of the Orl&eacute;ans <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Visitation in 1627. <a href="../cathen/07092b.htm">Mme Guyon</a>, celebrated in the annals of <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietism</a>, was born at Montargis in 1648. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was saved from English domination through the deliverance of Orl&eacute;ans by <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a> (8 May, 1429). On 21 July, 1455, her rehabilitation was publicly proclaimed at Orl&eacute;ans in a solemn procession, and before her death in November, 1458, Isabel Rom&eacute;e, the mother of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>, saw a monument erected in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of her daughter, at Tournelles, near the Orl&eacute;ans bridge. The monument, destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> in 1567, was set up again in 1569 when the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were once more masters of the city. Until 1792, and again from 1802 to 1830, finally from 1842 to the present day, a great religious feast, celebrated 8 May of every year at Orl&eacute;ans in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>, attracted multitudes. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Orl&eacute;ans was the last in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to take up again the Roman liturgy (1874). The Sainte Croix <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, perhaps built and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by St. Euvertius in the fourth century, was destroyed by fire in 999 and rebuilt from 1278 to 1329; the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> pillaged and destroyed it from 1562 to 1567; the Bourbon kings restored it in the seventeenth century.

<p>The principal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Our Lady of Bethlehem, at <a href="../cathen/06049d.htm">Ferri&egrave;res</a>; Our Lady of Miracles at Orl&eacute;ans, dating back to the seventh century (<a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a> visited its sanctuary 8 May, 1429); Our Lady of Cl&eacute;ry, dating from the thirteenth century, visited by <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, Philip VI, and especially by Louis XI, who wore in his hat a leaden image of Notre Dame de Cl&eacute;ry and who wished to have his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> in this sanctuary where Dunois, one of the heroes of the Hundred Years' <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was also <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a>. Prior to the Associations Law of 1901 the Diocese of Orl&eacute;ans counted <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, Missionary Priests of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, and several orders of teaching <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">Brothers</a>. Among the congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> which originated in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> must be mentioned: the Calvary <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, a teaching and nursing order founded in 1617 by Princess Antoinette d'Orl&eacute;ans-Longueville, and the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Leclerc du Tremblay known as P&egrave;re Joseph; the Sisters of St. Aignan, a teaching order founded in 1853 by <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Bishop Dupanloup</a>, with mother-house in Orl&eacute;ans. At the beginning of the twentieth century the religious congregations of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> conducted: 1 cr&egrave;che; 77 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; 2 institutions for the deaf and dumb; 10 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>; 2 houses for penitent <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 12 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for the care of the sick in their own homes; 2 houses of retreat; 27 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or asylums; 1 poor house. In 1905 (last year of the Concordat) the diocese had 371,019 inhabitants; 41 pastorates; 293 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 23 vicariates subventioned by the State.
