<h1>Diocese of Osma</h1>  

<p>(OXOMENSIS)

<p>The Diocese borders <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> and Logro&ntilde;o on the north, Soria and Saragossa on the east, Soria and <a href="../cathen/07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a> on the south, and Segovia on the west; and includes the civil provinces of Soria and <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, with a small portion of <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>. It is the ancient Uxama and has 1250 inhabitants. Burgo de Osma, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, has 3000. The origin of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is obscure: some refer it to St. James the Apostle, others to the reign of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>. Fl&oacute;rez alleges it only as "probable" that it existed in the first centuries when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to escape <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, used to establish their sees in obscure places; hence it might have been selected rather than Clunia, the capital of a judicial district. John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Osma, signed the acts of the Synod of Toledo, in 597; Gregory signed at the synod of 610; Gila signed the acts of the fourth and fifth Councils of Toledo, and sent as his delegate to the eighth, Godescalchus, who afterwards succeeded him, and signed the eleventh; Severian signed at the twelfth, and Sonna at the thirteenth and sixteenth. After the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> invasion the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Osma continued, as titulars, in Asturias: a letter against <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a>, addressed to Elipandus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo, is signed by Eterius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Osma, and Beatus, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The "Chronicon Albedense" mentions Felmirus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Osma, in the time of Alfonso III (821).

<p>The succession was then lost until Fern&aacute;n Gonzalez, Count of Castile, conquered Osma, placing in its see Silo, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Arlanza. The place was again lost, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> with it; but eventually Alfonso VI called in the Cluniacs, under Bernardo Salvit&aacute; (later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo), and made Pierre de Vitunis, a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Osma. Then began protracted boundary disputes with the Bishops of Oca and of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, compromised at the Council of Husillos, in <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, in 1088; others followed with the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/13788a.htm">Sig&uuml;enza</a> and of <a href="../cathen/14452a.htm">Tarazona</a>, to whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> Alfonso the Fighter assigned the territory taken from <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, finally settled in the time of Alfonso VII, at a council at <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, where Cardinal Guido was present as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>. After Vituris, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was occupied by Pedro, formerly <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Toledo, <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> as St. Peter of Osma. Finding the old church in ruins he chose as the site for a new one El Espinar. His successor, the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a>, Raymond Salvit&aacute;, continued the boundary controversy and the building of the church, and, having been transferred to the See of Toledo, was succeeded by Beltr&aacute;n (1128). To provide for the building of his church, Bishop Beltr&aacute;n obtained a commutation of the Vow of Santiago for a visit and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to Osma; he also founded the Confraternity of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>, the brethren of which bound themselves to leave legacies for the building of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.

<p>Bishop Diego de Acebes accompanied <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. In 1232 Bishop Juan Dominguez, finding the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> again too small, rebuilt it, with the exception of some <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, still to be seen, spared out of respect for the memory of St. Peter of Osma. It is in the transition style from Romanesque to ogival, with later improvements and additions. Pedro Gonzalez, Cardinal de Mendoza, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Osma in 1478, built the marble <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>. Bishop Pedro Acosta, who had previously occupied the <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">See of Oporto</a>, brought with him the Italian Giovanni di Juni, who (1540) embellished the re-table of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> with figures of St. Peter of Osma and St. Dominic, and also designed the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Bishop Acosta founded (1557), in Aranda de Duero, the "Sancti Spiritus" <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Santo Cristo del Milagro, originally designed as a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Dominic de Guzm&aacute;n. The <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> on the right is the gift of Bishop Martin Carrillo in 1641, that on the left, of the chapter in 1765. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Cristo del Milagro contains an altar and re-table, with an inscription giving the traditional legend, built by Bishop Andr&eacute;s <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">de Soto</a>. With the assistance of <a href="../cathen/09316c.htm">Bishop Garc&iuml;a de Loaisa</a>, Melendez de Gumiel, Dean of Osma, built the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Peter, now the chief patron of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Our Lady of the Thorn-bush, planned by Bishop Pedro Arastegui, corresponds to the Santo Christo. In 1506, Bishop Alonso Enriquez, rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>. Between 1736 and 1744 Pedro Agust&iacute;n de la Cuadra built the new tower adjoining the west wall in the Barocque style. Joaqu&iacute;n de Electa, confessor to Charles III, built a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> for <a href="../cathen/11414a.htm">Juan de Palafox</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Osma, completed in 1781. The frescoes are by Mariano Maella.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Osma were formerly lords of the city. At the petition of Bishop John II, Alfonso VIII issued a warrant confirming the lordship to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and left instructions that the lordship of Osma, with its castle, should be given to Bishop Mendo (1210-25) in recompense for his services at the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212). King John I granted the castle of Osma to Bishop Pedro Gonz&aacute;lez* de Frias, Bishop Pedro de Montoya surrounded Burgo with a wall, in 1456. Bishop Pedro Alvarez de Acosta founded the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at his own expense, and in 1578, adjacent to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the consistorial buildings, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and public granary. Bishop Sebastian Perez (1582-83) transferred the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to the Casas del Cortijo (Farm Buildings), and Fernando de Acebedo (1610-15) began the Seminary of S. Domingo de Guzm&aacute;n, which Bishop Joaqu&iacute;n Eleta reconstructed in 1783 after plans made by the engineer Sebastini. Sebastian de Ar&eacute;valo rebuilt the Hospital of S. Agustin, founded in 1468 by Pedro de Montoya.

<p>Soria, the capital, disputes with Osma the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. There is the church of S. Pedro, restored by Alfonso I of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, in 1108, and made collegiate in 1152 by John II, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Osma. Over the altar of the retro-choir is an "Entombment of Christ", by <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>. It was rebuilt by Bishop Acosta. Near Soria are the Romanesque ruins of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Juan de Duero and the hermitage of St. Saturius, patron of the city. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of La Merced at Soria once had for its superior the dramatist <a href="../cathen/14478a.htm">Gabriel Tellez (Tirso de Molina)</a>, to whom are due the building and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Merced.
