<h1>Diocese of Osnabr&uuml;ck</h1>  

<p>(OSNABRUGENSIS)

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, comprises, in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, the civil districts of Osnabr&uuml;ck and Aurich (excepting Wilhelmshaven) and that part of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> situated on the west of the Weser. In 1910 it numbered 12 deaneries, 108 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 153 pastoral stations, 271 secular and 12 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 204,500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. As Apostolic administrator, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Northern Missions of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and Prefect-Apostolic of Schleswig-Holstein (see <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">VICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF NORTHERN GERMANY</a>). According to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Impensa Romanorum" (26 March, 1824), he is elected by the chapter of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, composed of a dean, six canons, and four vicars, elected in turn by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and by the chapter. Among the higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the Gymnasium Carolinum, founded by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; similar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are at Meppen, Papenburg, and Osnabr&uuml;ck. The only <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of men are the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Klemenswerth and the Apostolic School of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a> at Meppen. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> include <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Borromeans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, and others.

<p>The Romanesque <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/04491a.htm">Sts. Crispin and Crispinian</a> was built at the beginning of the twelfth century, and replaced the wooden church erected by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. Later it took on Gothic embellishments, and in time became a treasury of precious objects of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> art. Other fine churches are St. John's, Osnabr&uuml;ck, with three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, Transition style (1256-1592), the Sacred Heart church (1897-1901), and the churches in Iburg, Lingen, Meppen, Kloster-Oesede, Bissendorf, Norden, Salzbergen, and others.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is veiled in obscurity, for lack of authentic documents. Osnabr&uuml;ck is certainly the oldest see founded by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was St. Wiho (785-804); the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Meginhard, or Meingoz (804-33), was the real organizer of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The temporal possessions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, originally quite limited, grew in time, and its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> exercised an extensive <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> within the territory covered by their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of immunity. The temporal protectorate (Advocatia, Vogtei) exercised over so many <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> became after the twelfth century hereditary in the Amelung <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, from whom it passed to Henry the Lion. After Henry's overthrow it fell to Count Simon of Tecklenburg and to his descendants, though the source of many conflicts with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In 1236 the Count of Tecklenburg was forced to renounce all <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the town of Osnabr&uuml;ck, and the lands of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, the chapter, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and chapter, from the thirteenth century on, spread their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and hamlets. Scarcely any other German see freed itself so thoroughly from <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> within its territory. The royal prerogatives were transferred little by little to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, e.g., the holding of fairs and markets, <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of toll and <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>, forest and hunting <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, mining royalties, fortresses, etc., so that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the early part of the thirteenth century was the real governor of the civil territory of Osnabr&uuml;ck.

<p>Among the prominent <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are Drogo (952-68); Conrad of Veltberg (1002); the learned <a href="../cathen/05047d.htm">Thietmar or Detmar</a> (1003-22); Benno II (1067-88); Johann I (1001-10), who built the actual <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in place of the wooden one destroyed by fire in the time of his predecessor; Diethard I (1119-37) was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> elected by the free choice of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; Philip II (1141-73) ended the conflicts between his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and the Abbeys of Corvey and Hersfeld; Arnold (1137-1191) died a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusader</a> before Akkon. In the time of Engelbert of Isenburg (1239-50), Bruno of Isenburg, and Conrad II of Rietberg (1269-97) the new orders of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and Augustinians were received with favour. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the power of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> waned before the increasing influence of the chapter, of the military servants (or <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and of the town of Osnabr&uuml;ck. The latter sought to free itself from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> sovereignty, but never became a free city of the empire. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was almost continually engaged in warlike troubles and difficulties and had also to defend itself against the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a> and M&uuml;nster. From the fourteenth century on we meet many <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a> of Osnabr&uuml;ck, made <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the civil <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> that absorbed the attention of the ordinary.

<p>The successor of Bishop Conrad IV of Rietberg (1488-1508) was Eric of Brunswick (1508-32), simultaneously <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a> and <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. He opposed the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> strongly and successfully. Franz of Waldeck (1533-53), also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>, acted, on the contrary, a very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> part. He offered little resistance to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> in <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, though he vigorously opposed the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>; after 1543 he allowed in Osnabr&uuml;ck an evangelical service. But the chapter and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> opposed a German service that dispensed with all the characteristics of the Mass. In 1548 Bishop Franz promised to suppress the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in Osnabr&uuml;ck, and to execute the Augsburg "Interim", but fulfilled his promise very indifferently; on his death-bed he received <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> communions. His successor, John IV of Hoya (1553-74), was more <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, but was succeeded by three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> temper: Henry III of Saxony (1574-85), Bernhard of Waldeck (1585-91), and Philip Sigismund (1591-1623). Under them the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> overran nearly the whole diocese.

<p>In 1624 Cardinal Eitel Frederick of Hohenzollern became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Osnabr&uuml;ck, and called in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. But he had scarcely begun his work when he died, and left to his successor, Francis of Wartenberg (1625-61), the task of executing the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>. The city-council was purified of anti-Catholic elements, and the former Augustinian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was turned over to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The Edict of Restitution was executed successfully by him, and in 1631 he founded a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at Osnabr&uuml;ck. But in 1633 Osnabr&uuml;ck was captured by the Swedes, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was discontinued, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religious exercises suppressed, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> (1633-51) administered by the conquerors. By the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> succeeded in preventing the secularization of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, as contemplated by the Swedes. Nevertheless, it was stipulated that henceforth a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (of the Augsburg Confession) would alternately hold the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. During the rule of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, always chosen from the House of Brunswick-L&uuml;neburg, the spiritual government of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was committed to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. Wartenberg was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1660, and was succeeded by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> married "bishop", Ernest Augustus (1661-98), who transferred the residence to <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>. He was succeeded by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Prince Charles Joseph of Lorraine, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (1698-1715). The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Bishop Ernest Augustus (1715-21) was succeeded by Clemens August of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Elector of Cologne (1721-61). The last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Prince Frederick of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1761-1803), later Duke of York, was, until his majority (1783), under the guardianship of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, George III of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>In 1803 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, the chapter, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> were finally secularized. The territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> passed to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> in 1806, to the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> in 1807, to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1810, and again to <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> in 1814. Klemens von Gruben, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Paros, was made <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, and as such cared for the spiritual interests of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. Under <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Impensa Romanorum Pontificum" (26 March, 1824) re-established the See of Osnabr&uuml;ck as an exempt see, i.e., <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, recognized by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, promised that, for the present, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a> would be also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Osnabr&uuml;ck, but had to be represented at Osnabr&uuml;ck by a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and an <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, and this lasted for thirty years. Klemens von Gruben was succeeded by the <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> Karl Anton von L&uuml;pke, also administrator of the North German Missions. After his death new negotiations led to the endowment of an independent <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, with the consent of King George V of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, appointed <a href="../cathen/10156a.htm">Paulus Melchers</a> of M&uuml;nster, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 3 August, 1857. In 1866 the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> passed, with <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>; <a href="../cathen/10156a.htm">Melchers</a> became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and was succeeded in 1866 by Johannes Heinrich Beckmann (1866-78), who was succeeded by Bernard H&ouml;ting (1882-98) after a vacancy of four years owing to the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1911), Hubert Voss, was appointed 12 April, 1899.
