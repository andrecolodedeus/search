<h1>Diocese of Oviedo</h1>  

<p>(OVETENSIS)

<p>This diocese comprises the civil province of the same name (the ancient Kingdom of Asturias), besides certain rural deaneries in the provinces of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a>, <a href="../cathen/09177a.htm">Le&oacute;n</a>, <a href="../cathen/15747c.htm">Zamora</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13458d.htm">Santander</a>. Its capital, the city of Oviedo, has a population of 42,716. The ancient capital of the Asturias country was Astorga (Asturica); Oviedo was founded by King Fruela I (756-68). In 760 Abbot Fromistanus and his nephew Maximus built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> there and dedicated a church to St. Vincent the Martyr; Fruela had houses built and the basilica of S. Salvador. His son, Alfonso II, the Chaste, made Oviedo his capital and restored the Church of S. Salvador. The same king founded the See of Oviedo, in 805, combining with it the ancient See of Britonia. A number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, expelled from their sees by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, were gathered at Oviedo, where they held two councils. It was there proposed to make Oviedo a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, and such it was from 869 until the ancient <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> of the Peninsula were restored, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> declared Oviedo exempt (1105); the Concordat of 1851 made it suffragan to Santiago.

<p>The Cathedral of S. Salvador was restored in the twelfth century by Archbishop Pelayo, the chronicler. Bishop Fernando Alfonso (1296-1301) undertook another restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>, and his successor, Fernando Alvarez (1302-1321), began the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. At the end of the thirteenth century Gutierre de Toledo began the new Gothic basilica, the principal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> bearing his arms, though it was completed by his successor Guill&eacute;n. Diego Ramirez de Guzm&aacute;n (1421-41) built the two <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the south <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> (now replaced by the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>), the old entrance to the church, and the gallery of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> adjoining the <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>. Alonzo de Palenzuela (1470-85) completed the other part of the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>. Juan Arias (1487-97) left his cognizance, the fleur-de-lys and four scallops, on the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>. Juan Daza (1497-1503) erected the grille of the choir; Valerano (1508-12) added the <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained-glass</a> windows. Diego de Muros, founder of the great college at Salamanca known as the Oviedo, had the crestings of the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> wrought by Pedro de Bunyeres and Juan de Cerecedo, while Giralte and Valmaseda completed the carving of the precious re-table in the time of Francisco de Mendoza (1525-28). Crist&oacute;bal de Rojas (1546-56) affixed his coat-of-arms to the completed tower, with its octagonal pyramid, one of the marvels of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>. The chief feature of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is the "Camara Santa", with its venerable <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. Bishop Pelayo relates that a coffer made by the disciples of the Apostles, and containing the most precious <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Holy City, was taken from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and after several translations was finally deposited at Oviedo by Alfonso II. In the sixteenth century, Bishop Crist&oacute;bal de Sandoval y Rojas wished to open it, but could not, being overcome with religious fear. Many other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are to be seen.

<p>The most famous sanctuary of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is at Covadonga (<em>Cova longa</em>), dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, by whose help the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, in 718, overcame the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> commanded by Alkaman. The old building was consumed by fire 17 October, 1777. The <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a>, who had charge of it, had been driven by lack of revenues to live scattered about in various <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, when Philip IV compelled them to return to community life, increasing their endowment, and building houses for them beside the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. <a href="../cathen/15218a.htm">Urban VII</a> made an order that the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> should be dignitary of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Oviedo. Charles III wished to rebuild the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> sumptuously, but never went beyond beginning the work. In recent times it has been completely restored by Bishop Sanz y Fores. Also noteworthy are the two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of S. Vicente and S. Pelayo at Oviedo. West of the city is the Gothic <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of S. Francisco, now used as a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. The church of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of S. Domingo is of the so-called Modern <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style; that of Sta Clari has a lofty tower; S. Isidro, formerly a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church, has a splendid <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> in ashlar stone. In the environs of Oviedo and on the slope of Monte Naranco are the famous churches of Sta Maria and S. Miguel, two art treasures of the ninth century and worthy of endless study. The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Oviedo was founded in 1851 by Bishop Ignacio Diaz Caneja; it consists of a great <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in Oviedo, and a little <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Valdedios de Villaviciosa, an old <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Besides the Provincial Institute of Secondary Education of Oviedo, there is another, founded by <a href="../cathen/08529a.htm">Jovellanos</a>, at Gijon.

<p>Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> worthy of mention are: Bishop Serrano, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint: Rodrigo, counsellor to Ferdinand II of <a href="../cathen/09177a.htm">Le&oacute;n</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> Fredolo, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> envoy to Alfonso the Wise; Rodrigo Sanchez, who executed important commissions for <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and kings of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; Fernando de Vald&eacute;s, founder of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Oviedo, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a> and inquisitor general; Jer&oacute;nimo de Velasco, one of the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and founder of the Hospital of Santiago at Oviedo; Alonso Antonio de San Mart&iacute;n, said to have been a natural son of Philip IV. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Oviedo celebrated its tercentenary in September, 1908. Its building is severe and simple, in Doric order of the seventeenth century; the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> is very extensive, and there is a good museum of natural history and meteorological observatory. This <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is now considered the least important in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, having but one faculty, that of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. Of recent years it has been falling under the influence of the Spanish Krausists. This <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, founded by Sanz del Rio, imported from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> doctrines of Kraus, and seeks to extend its activities by conferences and courses outside of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, even in the Latin American republics. Among the distinguished men of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> may be mentioned: the Alvarez of Asturias, who were famous in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; Ruy P&eacute;rez de Avil&eacute;s, celebrated in connexion with the conquest of Seville; Gutierre Bernaldode Quir&oacute;s, the hero of Aljubarrota; Pedro <a href="../cathen/10183a.htm">M&eacute;ndez</a>, the conqueror of <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>; in modern times, the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/08529a.htm">Jovellanos</a>, the Regalist Campomanes, the Liberal Arg&uuml;elles Florez Estrada, Pidal, Posada Herrera; Cardinals Cienfuegos Sierra, Cienfuegos Jovellanos, Inguanzo, and many notable <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>.
