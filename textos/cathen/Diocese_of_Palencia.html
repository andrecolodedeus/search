<h1>Diocese of Palencia</h1>  

<p>(PALENTINA)

<p>This Diocese comprises the civil provinces of Palencia, <a href="../cathen/13458d.htm">Santander</a>, <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>. Palencia, the capital of the province of that name, has a population of 15,050. Fl&oacute;rez dates the origin of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> from the first centuries. Its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may have been among those assembled in the third century to depose <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02018d.htm">Astorga</a>. According to Idatius the city of Palencia was almost destroyed (457) in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> between the Suevi and the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>. The Priscillianistic <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> originated in Galicia, and spread over the Tierra de Campos. It was strongly opposed by St. Toribius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02018d.htm">Astorga</a>. Maurila, an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> placed by Leovigild in Palencia, <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> when King Recared (587) was converted, and in 589 he assisted at the Third Council of Toledo. Conantius, the biographer of <a href="../cathen/07649b.htm">St. Ildephonsus</a>, assisted at the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in Toledo in 610, and at the fourth, fifth, and sixth Toledan Councils. He composed many new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> melodies and a book of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> from the Psalms. He ruled the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for more than thirty years, and had for pupil <a href="../cathen/06311a.htm">St. Fructuosus of Braga</a>.

<p>To defend his new country, Alfonso I devastated the Campos G&oacute;ticos (Gothic Fields), i.e. the Tierra de Campos, as far as the Duero. The Arabian authors only once cite Palencia in the division of the provinces previous to the Ommiad dynasty. In the Council of <a href="../cathen/11363a.htm">Oviedo</a> (811) we find Abundantius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Palencia, but he was apparently only a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Froila, Count of Villafruela, succeeded in restoring the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 921, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> restorer was Sancho the Elder, of Navarre and Castile. The first <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of the restored see (1035) is said to have been Bernardo, who was given command over the city and its lands, with the various castles and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. Bernardo was born in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> or Navarre, and devoted himself to the construction of the original <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> built over the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> (Antolin). It was rebuilt three centuries later. Its principal treasure was the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a>, formerly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in Aquitania. Alfonso VI conferred many privileges on Bernardo's successor, Raimundo. Pedro, a native of <a href="../cathen/01209b.htm">Agen</a> (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>) and one of the noted men brought in by Bishop Bernardo of Toledo, succeeded Bishop Raimundo. For his fidelity to Queen Urraca, he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by Alfonso I of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. In 1113 a provincial council was held in Palencia by Archbishop Bernardo to quell the disorders of the epoch. On the liberation of Pedro, another council was held in Palencia during the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> of 1129, at which Raimundo, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo, and the celebrated <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Santiago, Diego Gelm&iacute;rez, assisted. The long and beneficent administration of Pedro was succeeded by that of Pedro II, who died in <a href="../cathen/01328a.htm">Almeria</a> and was succeeded by Raimundo II. Bishop Tello took part in the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, where the Palencians won the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to emblazon the cross over their castle.

<p>At the beginning of the fifteenth century Bishop Sancho de Rojas valiantly fought the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> of Antequera, and in the Treaty of Caspe aided the Infante Ferdinand to secure the crown of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. St. Vincent Ferrer preached in Palencia, converting thousands of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, with whose <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> be founded the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of S. Salvador, later connected with that of S. Antolin. Among the succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Palencia, who, as <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lords, were members of the noblest <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, we may mention Rodrigo de Velasco (died 1435); Rodrigo Sanchez de Ar&eacute;valo, author of a history of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in Latin (1466); the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Mendoza (1472-1485) and Fonseca (1505-1514) who decorated the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Pedro de Castilla (1440-1461); Fray Alonso de <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> (1485-1499); La Gasca (1550-1561), and Zapata (1569-1577).
<h2>The University of Palencia</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was founded by Alfonso VIII at the request of Bishop Tello T&eacute;llez de Meneses and was the first <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. It was the model upon which was patterned the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>. Study began to flourish in Palencia and men notable for their virtue and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> came from its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, among them St. Julian of Cuenca, <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, and St. Peter Gonz&aacute;lez* Telmo; hence the adage: "En Palencia armas y ciencia" (In Palencia arms and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>). The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was founded about 1212, shortly after the aforesaid victory of "Las Navas" (others say in 1208), and the king summoned from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> noted teachers of various arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, retaining them in Palencia on large salaries. The death of the founder in 1214, the minority of Henry I, and the growth of its fortunate rival, Salamanca, caused the decay of Palencia, many of whose professors and students went to Salamanca, whence the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of a transfer of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to the latter place. In 1243 Archbishop Rodrigo records that in spite of unpropitious events, study continued in Palencia and that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Juan de Abbeville, in a Council of Valladolid (1228) had endeavoured to revive it. Bishop Fernando obtained from <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> (14 May, 1263) a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> granting to the professors and students of Palencia all the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. But lack of financial support and the proximity of the prosperous <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a> made a revival of Palencia impossible, and it died out before the end of the thirteenth century, probably in 1264, at which time the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was definitely transferred to Valladolid. It was Bishop Telo who also established <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; the former was famous for the striking conversion of St. Peter Gonz&aacute;lez* Telmo.

<p>Among the most celebrated natives of the province are the first Marquis of Santillana, Bishop Inigo L&oacute;pez de Mendoza, the immortal <a href="../cathen/02516b.htm">Berruguete</a>, and Do&ntilde;a Mar&iacute;a de Padilla.

<p>Palencia is famous for the great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Zoilo, a <em>rococo</em> monument, the work of Juan de <a href="../cathen/02193a.htm">Badajoz</a>. Mention has already been made of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of S. Barnab&eacute; and S. Antolin. The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was founded in 1584 by Bishop Alvaro de Mendoza.
