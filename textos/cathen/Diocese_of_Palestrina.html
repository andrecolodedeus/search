<h1>Diocese of Palestrina</h1>  

<p>(PB&AElig;NESTINENSIS)

<p>The town of Palestrina, in the province of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, is the ancient Pr&aelig;neste, situated on the Via Labicana, the origin of which was attributed by the ancients to Ulysses, or to another fabulous personage. It is first mentioned in history as an ally of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> against the Latins, in 499 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> From 373 to 370, however, it was in continual <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or her allies, and was defeated by Cincinnatus; in 354 and in 338 it lost portions of its territory. Thenceforth it was always an ally of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but disdained Roman citizenship until 90 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> In 82, having received Marius, it was taken and sacked by Sulla; later, under <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, it became a <em>municipium</em>. It was a summer resort of the Romans, who ridiculed the language and the rough manners of its inhabitants. The modern town is built on the ruins of the famous temple of Fortuna Primigenia. From the eleventh century, it was a fief of the Colonna, and a refuge in their rebellions against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>; consequently, it was several times destroyed, as in 1297, by order of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and in 1436, by Giovanni Vitelleschi, at the command of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>. It was rebuilt in 1447, sacked in 1527, and occupied by the Duke of Alba, in 1556. In 1630, it was sold to the Barberini. The town contains remnants of cyclopean walls and of the aforesaid great temple of Fortune. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> has fine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and frescoes. In the Church of St. Rosalia (1677) there is an admirable Piet&agrave;, carved in the solid rock. Palestrina is the birthplace of the <a href="../cathen/01688a.htm">archeologist</a> Andrea Fulvio and of the prince of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">sacred music</a>, <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina</a>. The oldest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> record of this city relates to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Agapitus, patron of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which took place under <a href="../cathen/02108b.htm">Aurelian</a>; this basilica was restored and enriched with costly gifts by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a>. Secundus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Palestrina, was at the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (313), and the names of several other of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in ancient times are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. From the sixth century there was a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the site of Castel S. Pietro, overlooking the city. After the seventh century, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Palestrina was one of the hebdomadary <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> for the services of the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a>, and was, therefore, a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; he is the fourth, in order, of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of this see may be mentioned Gregory, who in 757 <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Constantine; Andreas, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> to King Desiderius, in 772; Petrus (996), the first to bear the title of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; Uberto (1073), <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> to Henry IV; Conon (1111), who embellished the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of St. Agapitus; S. Stefano (1122), a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, praised by <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> and <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; Guarino Guarini (1144), a Regular Canon of St. Augustine, famous for his virtues; Manfredo (1166) who persuaded <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> to become reconciled with <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>; Paolo Scolari (1181), later <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a>; Blessed Guido de Pare (1196), a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>; Jacopo Pecoraria (1231); Stefano III (1244), previously <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>; Girolamo d'Ascoli (1278), a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, later <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a>; Pietro d'Anablay (1306), Grand Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; <a href="../cathen/08788b.htm">Simon de Langham</a> (1376), an Englishman. During the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, also, appointed <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a> of Palestrina. Thereafter, as a result of the custom that gave to <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a> the option of selecting another <a href="../cathen/14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> see, the rule of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of Palestrina was of short duration. Among those who followed were Hugues de Lusignan (1431), a brother of the King of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>; Guglielmo Brissonette (1507), deposed by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> for attending the conciliabule of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>; <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Lorenzo Campeggio</a> (1535); Gianvicenzo Carafa (1539); Giovanni M. del Monte (1543), later <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>; Louis de Bourbon (1550); Federico Cesi (1557); Giovanni Morone (1562); Cristoforo Madruzzi (1564); Gian Antonio Serbelloni (1578); Marcantonio Colonna (1587); Alessandro Medici (1602), later <a href="../cathen/09166a.htm">Leo XI</a>; <a href="../cathen/02483a.htm">Guido Bentivoglio</a> (1641); Alfonso de la Queva (1644); Antonio Barberini (1661), who founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Paluzzo Altieri (1691); Girolamo Spinola (1775); Aurelio Rovarella (1809), who died an exile in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1812; Diego Caracciolo (1814); Giuseppe Spina (1820); Castruccio Castracani degli Antelminelli (1844). The sanctuary of Our Lady of Good Counsel of Genazzano is in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; here, also, are the ancient see of Gabii, ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of which, between the fifth and the ninth centuries, are known, and that of Subaugusta, four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of which are known between 465 and 502. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has 24 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 45,700 inhabitants, 10 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, 14 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and 3 girls' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.
