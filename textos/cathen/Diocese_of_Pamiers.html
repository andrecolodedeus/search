<h1>Diocese of Pamiers</h1>  

<p>(APAM&AElig;A)

<p>A Diocese comprising the Department of Ari&egrave;ge, and suffragan of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. The territory forming it was united to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>; the Concordat of 1817 re-established at Pamiers a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which existed only in September, 1823, uniting the ancient Dioceses of Pamiers and Couserans, the larger portion of the former Dioceses of Mirepoix and Rieux and a deanery of the former Diocese of Alet (See <a href="../cathen/03331b.htm">CARCASSONNE</a>). A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> 11 March, 1910, re-established the titles of the former Sees of Couserans and Mirepoix.
<h2 id="section1">Diocese of pamiers</h2>

<p>The traditions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> mention as its first Apostle of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a>, born at Fredelacum near Pamiers, an apostle of the Rouergue, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in his native country (date uncertain). The Abbey of St. Antonin was founded near Fredelacum about 960; in 1034 it passed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Bishops of Girone and was annexed in 1060 to the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Congregation of Cluny</a>. A castle built on the site of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by Roger II, Count of Foix (1070-1125), was called <em>Appamia;</em> hence the name of Pamiers which passed to the neighbouring small town. <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> created a see at Pamiers by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Romanus Pontifex" 23 July, 1295, and made it a suffragan of Narbonne. He named Bernard Saisset <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Antonin, and by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> 18 April, 1296, settled the boundaries of the new diocese dismembered from that of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. The opposition of Hughes Mascaron, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and the conflict between Saisset and Roger Bernard III, Count of Foix, prevented Saisset from taking immediate possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Abb&eacute; Vidal has proven that it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as had long been thought, that St. Louis of Anjou, who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> at the death of Mascaron, had been appointed provisional administrator of the Diocese of Pamiers. Saisset took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on 19 April, 1297; having sided with <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (1301), he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by order of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>.

<p>After careful investigation, <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, 3 August, 1308, complied with certain demands of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and the Diocese of Pamiers remained, but with poorer resources than those assigned it by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. However, when <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> raised <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> to an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, 22 Feb., 1318, he also extended the Diocese of Pamiers which he made suffragan of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. Saisset's successor was Jacques Fournier (1317-26), subsequently <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>. Vidal discovered in the Vatican Library the record of the procedure of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> tribunal created at Pamiers, by Jacques Fournier in 1318, for the extirpation of the remnants of <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensianism</a> in the Foix region; this document is most important for the history of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, representing as it does, and perhaps in this instance only, that particular tribunal in which the monastic inquisitor and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had almost equal power, as decreed in 1312 by the Council of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. In this new regime the traditional procedure of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> was made milder by temporizing with the accused who persisted in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, by granting defendants a fair amount of liberty, and by improving the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> regime. Among the noteworthy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Pamiers were Cardinal Arnaud de Villemur (1348-50); Cardinal Amanieu d'Albret (1502-06); John of Barban&ccedil;on (1550-55), who became a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>; Robert of Pellev&eacute; (1557-79), during whose episcopate the religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> gave rise to cruel strife: <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> destroyed every church in Pamiers, among them the magnificent <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Notre-Dame du Camp, and three times they demolished the episcopal palace of the Mas Saint-Antonin. <a href="../cathen/14235a.htm">Henry of Sponde</a> (1626-42), Spondanus, who summarized and continued the Ecclesiastical Annals of his friend <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>; the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/03458b.htm">Fran&ccedil;ois Etienne de Caulet</a> (1644-1680).
<h2 id="section2">See of couserans or conserans</h2>

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was St. Valier. (Valerius) before the sixth century. Bishop Glycerius was present at the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> in 506. According to Mgr Duchesne he should be identified with a certain Licerius (St. Lizier) whom the <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana"</a> places lower in the list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; he was <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of St-Lizier, the episcopal residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Couserans, suffragans of <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a>. The historian Bishop Pierre de Marca (1643-52) president of the Parliament of Navarre, was subsequently <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.
<h2 id="section3">See of rieux</h2>

<p>A See erected by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> in 1317, as suffragan to the archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Cardinal de Rabastens (1317-21); Cardinal de St-Martial (1359-72).
<h2 id="section4">See of mirepoix</h2>

<p>A See erected by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> in 1317 as suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Jacques Fournier (1326-1327); David B&eacute;thon, Cardinal de Balfour (1537-46); Innocent, Cardinal de Monti (1553-1555); Jean Suavius, Cardinal de Mirepoix (1555-60); the academician Boyer, preceptor to the Dauphin, father of Louis XVI (1730-1736).

<p>The Diocese of Pamiers specially honours St. Gerontius, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (date unknown) who gave his name to the city of St-Girons. The Council of Pamiers in 1212 drew up forty-nine articles concerning the police of the States of Simon de Montfort, and of the other seigneurs to whom had been given the lands of the defeated <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> noblemen. In a council held at Foix in 1226, Cardinal de Saint-Ange, <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III's</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, absolved Bernard, Count of Foix, who had become a follower of the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, of the crime of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The celebrated Guy de Levis who had the title of "Mar&eacute;chal de la foi et des crois&eacute;s", received in acknowledgement of his conduct in the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the city of Mirepoix which remained the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the house of Levis until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolution</a>. Aside from the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of St. Antonin at Pamiers, the chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> centres are: Notre-Dame d'Ax les Thermes; Notre-Dame du Camp at Pamiers; Notre-Dame de Celles at Celles; Notre-Dame de l'Isard in the valley of Aran; Notre-Dame du Marsan at St-Lizier, <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> centre dating back to the tenth century; Notre-Dame de Sabart, established after a victory won by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> over the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>; Notre-Dame du Val d'Amour, at Belesta; Notre-Dame de Vals; Notre-Dame de Varilhes. Pilgrims are also attracted to St-Martin of Oydes by the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Anastasius, by St. Anthony's at Lezat, and by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> fountain of Eycheil, which according to tradition, gushed forth after St. Lizier had been <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>. Prior to the enforcement of the Law of 1901, the Diocese of Pamiers had <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and teaching <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">Brothers</a>. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the religious congregations of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> had charge of 19 day nurseries, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 4 industrial rooms, 2 sheltering houses, 10 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 1 insane asylum, 2 houses of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> for the care of the sick in their own homes. In 1905 (last year of the period covered by the Concordat) the Diocese of Pamiers had a population of 210,527, with 22 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 321 mission churches, 20 vicariates subventioned by the State.
