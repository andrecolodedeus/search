<h1>Diocese of Pamplona</h1>  

<p>(PAMPILONENSIS)

<p>This Diocese comprises almost all of <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a> and part of Guipuzcoa. This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is said to date from Apostolic times. It is matter of tradition in the churches of Pamplona, Toledo, and <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>), that <a href="../cathen/13486b.htm">St. Saturninus</a>, disciple of St. Peter, sent from <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Honestus to preach to the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, and later came in person. Finding that Honestus had already made many converts, Saturninus left him in Pamplona. Honestus was the teacher of St. Firminus (son of the senator Firmus), first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pamplona. Firminus went later into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>. There is no note of any other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pamplona until 589, when Liliolus signed as such in the Third Council of Toledo. During the seventh century other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are known as signatories of various councils of Toledo. It was not known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> succeeded in establishing themselves in Pamplona (Ferreras affirms and Moret denies it); at all events, there is no record of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pamplona from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> invasion until the reign of Opilanus (829). The old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> had meanwhile fallen into ruins, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> now took refuge in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/13450b.htm">San Salvador</a> of Leyre (founded in the eighth century). Inigo Arista recovered Pamplona in 848 or 849, and restored the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, converting it into a stronghold. This was for a long time the episcopal court and see, and hither Arista had transferred the bodies of the holy virgins Nunilona and Alodia, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a> in the time of Abd-er-Rahman II.

<p>It was the wish of Sancho the Elder to introduce into Leyre the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> reform, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> (e.g. in the Council of Pamplona of 1023) resisted until 1090, during the reign of Sancho Ramirez. In the said council they resolved to restore the See of Pamplona, and decreed that all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Pamplona should be thereafter of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Leyre like Sancho I, who then occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. In 1025 the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Leyre were affiliated with the canons of Pamplona, and Juan II took the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pamplona and Leyre, and signed in a number of decrees "Joannes, ecclesi&aelig; Navarrensium <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>". Until the reign of Sancho Ramirez (1076-94) Leyre remained the seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Pamplona. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> held under its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> fifty-eight towns and seventy-two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, and was besides the mausoleum of the Kings of Navarre. Theobald I brought <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to Leyre, but at the end of the same century the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Cluny returned and occupied it for some time. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is now in ruins, and its church serves as that of a rural <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. The see having been reestablished in Pamplona, King Sancho Ramirez (1076-94) procured the appointment as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pedro de Roda, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St. Pons de Tomi&egrave;res, who built the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and established a chapter of canons under the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Pamplona, as such, presided over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order and the three estates that made up the Cortes of Navarre. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> held the seigniory of the city, and its canons enjoyed the privileges of the royal family. Bishop Sancho de Larrosa <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, completed in 1124. His predecessor, Guillermo Gast&oacute;n, had accompanied King Alfonso to the conquest of Saragossa, and there founded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of "St. Michael of the Navarrese".

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Pamplona is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> the ancient <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of "St. Mary, the White Virgin (<em>Santa Mar&iacute;a la Blanca, Santa Maria de la Sede</em> or <em>del Sagrario</em>), which was preserved in Leyre from very ancient times until the eleventh century. There is also a <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> containing a thorn from <a href="../cathen/04540b.htm">Our Saviour's crown</a>, given by St. Louis to Theobald II; likewise the heads of the virgins Nunilona and Alodia, whose bodies were in Leyre. Bishop Pedro de Artajona &mdash; known as Pedro of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, because it was there he had received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> &mdash; obtained from <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> (1191) the confirmation of all the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Pamplona, and procured besides from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a> a few <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Firmin whose feast was from this time (1186) celebrated with the same solemnity as the feasts of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. In 1197 Sancho the Strong ceded his palace to Bishop Garcia. The sovereigns, Donna Juana and Philip of <a href="../cathen/05671a.htm">Evreux</a>, recovered it, leaving it in turn to Bishop Arnaldo de Barbaz&aacute;n; their son, Carlos the Bad, returned it to Bishop Miguel Sanchez de Asiain, and later to Bishop Bernardo Folcant. Since the union of <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a> and Castille, it had been occupied by the viceroys, and is today the headquarters of the Captaincy-General. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> resided later in the "Casa del Condestable" (House of the Constable, i.e., of the Duke of Alba) until Bishop Melchor Angel Gutierrez Vallejo commenced the new palace, completed by Francisco III Ignacio A&ntilde;oa y Busto. In 1317 Jimeno III, Garcia being <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Pamplona, formerly a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, became a suffragan of Saragossa. Carlos III the Noble reconstructed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and gave it for twelve years the fortieth part of the royal revenues from <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>. Bishop Martin de Zavala, partisan of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Pedro de Luna</a>, aided in the erection. In 1400 Emperor Manuel Pal&aelig;ologus gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Pamplona a particle of the wood of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> and another of the reputed blue vestment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>; these <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Toward the end of the eighteenth century Bishop Sancho de Oteyza completed the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of St. Saturnioro is a very old structure and has but one <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>; not far from this is pointed out the well where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> his first converts. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Lorenzo was renovated in the eighteenth century, and enlarged by the erection of the Chapel of St. Firminus on the spot where tradition says he was born. The basilica of <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius of Loyola</a> was erected in the place where that saint was wounded when fighting against the French. In 1601 Viceroy Juan de Cardona had an arch erected with an inscription, and later Count de Santisteban urged the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to raise the basilica, which was opened on 10 October, 1694. Former <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> have been converted into barracks and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Francis into <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The sanctuaries of Ignatius Loyola and Francis Xavier belong to this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. That of Loyola contains the old house of St. Ignatius enshrined in a monument constructed by Fontana under the auspices of Queen Mariana of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, mother of Carlos II (1689-1738). The sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, home of the Apostle of the Indies, has been restored by the generosity of the Dukes of Villahermosa (1896-1901). The collegiate church of our Lady of Roncesvalles was founded at the beginning of the ninth century as a hospice for travellers on their way to Compostela or from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. There are two <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in Pamplona, a <em>conciliar</em> and an <em>episcopal</em>. There was also a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, first incorporated with that of Saragossa and in 1745 with that of Alcal&aacute;. It was founded in 1608 by resolution of the Cortes of Navarre in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> College of the Rosary, approved by Philip III in 1619, and established by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> in 1621. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1623 and Philip IV in 1630 confirmed it. In this <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> the well-known moralist, Francisco Larraga, was a professor. It boasts of other famous scholars &mdash; jurists like Martin de Azpilcueta, historians like the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Moret, missionaries like <a href="../cathen/03149c.htm">Calatayud</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> like the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Prudencio de Sandoval, historian of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>.
