<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Diocese of Parma</h1>  

<p>Located in central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated on the river of the same name, an affluent of the Po, flowing through a fertile plain, where grain and vines are cultivated; it also contains many fine pastures; the silk culture is highly developed, as also the cheese, tobacco, and leather industries.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun in 1060, to replace the ancient one destroyed by fire two years earlier; finished in 1074, it was dedicated in 1106 by Paschal II. It is a fine example of the Lombard style, in the shape of a Latin cross, with three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>; three tiers of galleries, supported by small columns, give a bright aspect to the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>, of the sixteenth century, is adorned with frescoes by Correggio, <a href="../cathen/11506b.htm">Parmigianino (Girolamo Mazzuola)</a>, and other masters; the inlaid work and the carvings of the choir and of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> are by Lendinara and the Consorzialis; there are four <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> by Giacomo and Damiano da Gonzate; the <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, with its beautiful <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a>, is of the fifteenth century; in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Bishop St. Bernardo, with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by Prospero Clementi. The <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> is separate, in the shape of an irregular octagon, and was begun in 1196 by the architect and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Benedetto Antelami.

<p>Other churches of note are: San Giovanni Evangelista, formerly of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, founded in 981, restored in 1510, <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> by Simone Moschino (1604), contains the best <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of Correggio and <a href="../cathen/11506b.htm">Mazzuola</a>; the Steccata (1521), by Zaccagni, on the plan of a Greek cross, with a majestic <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>, containing pictures by Parmigianino and other masters; the Annunziata, in which there are frescoes by Correggio; Santa Maria del Quartiere, the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> of which was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by Barnabei; S. Rocco; S. Antonio; S. Sepolcro contains works by <a href="../cathen/02203b.htm">Baglioni</a>, Cignaroli, and <a href="../cathen/11506b.htm">Mazzola</a>; and the Oratorio di S. Lodovico, formerly the ducal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. Among the palaces are: del Giardino (1564), with frescoes by <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Carracci</a>; della Pilotta (1597), with a museum of antiquities, and a gallery of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> especially rich in works by Correggio; and the Biblioteca Palatina, containing 303,836 volumes, 4770 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and 60,000 copper engravings. There are monuments in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Correggio and Parmigianino. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which dates from 1025, was instituted with pontifical privileges only in 1392, and was developed, more especially, by Duke Ferdinando di Borbone; there are several intermediary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, besides the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for foreign missions, an Accademia of the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, and State archives.

<p>Parma was a city of the Boian Gauls, to which a Roman colony was sent in 183 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> In 377, the town suffered so greatly from the barbarians that <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> numbers it among the ruined cities. The Lombards took the city in 569 or 570, but their chief in 590 placed himself under the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> Callinicus, who in 601 took possession of Parma, and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> the Duke Godiscalc; the city however soon returned to the Lombards (603). According to the "Vita Hadriani", Parma was comprised in the donation of Pepin to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; but in reality, it appears to have belonged to the kings of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, who, in the tenth century, gave over the government to its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in whose hands it remained until St. Bernardo resigned it in 1106; from which time the city governed itself as a free commune, first under a consul, and then under a podest&agrave;. In 1167 it was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to join the Lombard League. In the thirteenth century (1199, 1200, 1204), Parma was at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with its neighbour <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>; later it aroused the indignation of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> of a pontifical <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>. In 1218 a peace was established. In the struggle between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, Parma was at first on the side of the emperor; but in 1247, the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> obtained possession of the town, which Frederick attempted in vain to take. Uberto Pallavicino, a native of Parma and a <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a>, stood out against Ezzelino, and succeeded in becoming podest&agrave; of Parma. In the fourteenth century (1303-16) Gilberto da Correggio became lord; after him, Gianquirico Sanvitale and the brothers de' Rossi contended for the lordship; then came John of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> (1331), Mastino della Scala (1335-41), the sons of da Correggio, Obizzo d'Este.

<p>Finally, through purchase, Parma was annexed to the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and so remained, except for a time when it was governed by the de' Rossi and by the Terzi (1404-20), until 1499, when Louis XII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> took possession. In 1512 <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> united Parma to the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>; it should be said that John of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> had previously held it as a fief of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; but from 1515 to 1521, the city was again in the hands of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1545, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> erected Parma and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> into a duchy, in favour of his son Pierluigi Farnese; then began for Parma an era of splendour, during which Correggio (Allegri), <a href="../cathen/11506b.htm">Mazzola</a>, and other famous masters showered treasures of art upon it. Pierluigi, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by the people and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by the nobles, fell at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, 10 Sept., 1547, the victim of a conspiracy directed by Ferrante Gonsaga, imperial Governor of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The garrison of Parma prevented the city from falling into the power of Ferrante, as <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> fell; and after long negotiations with the emperor, the son of Pierluigi, Ottavio, was confirmed in the duchy by <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> in 1550. That prince governed wisely, and a conspiracy against him by Count Landi was happily frustrated.

<p>He was succeeded in 1585 by Alessandro Farnese, who became famous in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and who died of a wound at <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>, in 1592. Ranuccio enlarged the state and protected study, founding a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of nobles; his son Odoardo, in 1622, succeeded to the duchy, which was governed during his minority by his mother Margherita and his uncle Cardinal Odoardo, as regents. During this reign there arose the contention with the Barberini for possession of the Duchy of Castro, an ancient fief of the Farnese, and that strife ended in the destruction of Castro, in 1649 under the son of Ranuccio II (1646-94). Duke Francesco, having died without children, was succeeded by his brother Antonio (1727-31), who also died without issue; and the succession to the duchy complicated the War of the Spanish Succession. By the treaty of Seville, the duchy was given to Charles of Bourbon, son of Philip V of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Isabella Farnese (daughter of Francesco); and when Charles ascended the throne of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> gave Parma to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1736; the battle of Parma, 1734); but the intrigues of Isabella did not cease until the Peace of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aix-la-Chapelle</a> had given the Duchy of Parma and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, enlarged with that of <a href="../cathen/07053b.htm">Guastalla</a>, to her other son Philip (1749). This prince inaugurated a French absolutism in the duchy, especially at the expense of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1765 he fell from his horse, was trampled upon, and dogs tore him to pieces. Under Ferdinando (1765-1802) relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> grew still more strained in imitation of the French court, he first concentrated, and then suppressed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, and was supported against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the other Bourbon courts. In 1802 the duchy was annexed to the French republic, In 1814 it was given to Marie Louise, wife of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, against whom a revolution broke out in 1831, but was quickly suppressed by Austrian troops. Marie Louise was succeeded by Carlo Lodovico, Duke of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, against whom a new revolution broke out in 1848, and the city was occupied by the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a>. On the other hand, Carlo II abdicated in favour of his son Carlo III (1849). After the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> defeat at <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, the Austrians placed Carlo III on the throne of Parma, but he was stabbed to death in 1854, and in 1859 his son Robert was dethroned, while the annexation of his state to <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> was decreed.

<p>The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Parma is Urbanus, a partisan of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Ursicinus, and deposed by Pope Damasus in 378. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Gratiosus (680); Lantpertus (827); Wihbodus (860-77), who bore important charges from Louis II and his successors; Aicardus in 920 restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which had been destroyed by fire; Sigefredus, a former chancellor of King Hugo, accompanied in 937 Hugo's daughter Berta, the promised bride of Constantine Porphyrogenitus; Hucbertus (961), to whom <a href="../cathen/12651b.htm">Ratherius di Verona</a> dedicated his "De contemptu canonum"; <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Cadalous</a> obtained his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> through <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, and became the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Honorius II, while remaining <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Parma; his successor, Everardo (1073), was a partisan of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a>, in whose interest Everardo even resorted to arms, but was defeated by the Countess Matilda, near Sorbara (1084); he was succeeded by another <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, Wido (1085), in whose place was put (1091) St. Bernardodegli Uberti, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Vallombrosa and a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. St. Bernardo, however, in 1104, was dragged <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> from the altar, and driven from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, to which he was not able to return peacefully until 1106; he resigned the temporal power held by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and, having opposed the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Conrad (1127) was again <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee from Parma, and died in 1133; Aicardo, a partisan of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>, and therefore deposed (1167); Obizzo Fieschi, an uncle of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>; Gratian (1224), professor of law at Bologna; Alberto Sanvitale (1243), and his brother Obizzo (1259), nephews of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>; Obizzo exerted himself greatly for the reform of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, favoured the "Milizia di Ges&ugrave; Cristo", and exposed the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Apostolici, founded by the Parmesan Gherardo Segarelli; Ugolino Rossi (1322) was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee from Parma, with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Guglielmo, on account of the latter's political reverses (1334); Gian Antonio da S. Giorgio (1500) a learned <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; Alessandro Farnese (1509), became <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a>, he resigned the See of Parma in favour of his nephew, Cardinal Alessandro; Alessandro Sforza (1560), who distinguished himself at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; Ferrante Farnese, (1573) active in the cause of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform; Camillo Marazzani (1711), who governed the diocese during forty-eight years; Adeodato Turchi (1788), a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> who wrote beautiful pastorals and <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>; Cardinal Francesco Caselli (1804), a former superior of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> and a companion of <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> during the negotiation of the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat with Napoleon</a>; at the national council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1811, he defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>The diocese, a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and later of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and of Bologna (1582), depends immediately on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> since 1815; it has 306 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 232,913 inhabitants, 9 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, 18 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> for male students, 5 for girls, 1 bi-weekly periodical (<em>Ol Giornale del popolo</em>) and 2 monthly magazines (<em>L'Eco; Lede e Civilt&agrave;</em>).
