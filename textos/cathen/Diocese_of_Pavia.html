<h1>Diocese of Pavia</h1>  

<p>(PAPIA)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. It is situated in a fertile plain; the city is connected with <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> by the Naviglio canal. It was once famous for the manufacture of <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organs</a>. Of its many <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> towers, which gave to it the name of "city of the hundred towers", few remain; a covered bridge <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fourteenth century is worthy of note. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built by Rocchi and <a href="../cathen/01375c.htm">Omodeo</a> (1488) on the site of the churches of San Stefano and Santa Maria del Popolo; it contains <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Crespi, Gatti, and others; a beautiful silver <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> of the Holy Thorns, and a carved <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> by Zanella; the altar of St. Syrus, in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>, is by Orseolo. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro is the former <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, restored in the twelfth century; it receives its present name from the golden background of its <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>; the body of St. Augustine is preserved in this church; King Luitprand brought it here from <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> and concealed it. It was rediscovered in 1695 in a casket of lead and silver, within a marble enclosure; there were lengthy proceedings for its identification; the marble <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> is an exquisite production of the fourteenth century, ordered by the prior Bonifacio, of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the marquesses Bottigello; it is adorned with 50 <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a> and 95 statuettes. <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a> is also buried there. Other churches are: Santa Maria del Carmine (1376), a Gothic structure, contains beautiful <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>; San Francesco (1260), also Gothic; Santa Maria di Canepanova (1492), planned by <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a>, an octagonal building with a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> and beautiful frescoes contains the mausoleum of the Duke of Brunswick; San Teodoro, Lombard period, under its altar are St. Theodore's <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>; San Michele Maggiore (seventh century), where the kings were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>, the most notable monument of Lombard architecture, contains a crucifix of the eighth century; San Marino, built by <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">King Astolfo</a>, and restored in 1481; Sts. Primo and Feliciano; Santa Maria in Bethlem, a Lombard structure San Salvatore (seventh century), contains <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of several Lombard kings; San Lanfranco (1237), contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of its <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, made by order of Cardinal Pallavicino in 1498. Outside the city is the famous Certosa, founded by Gian Galeazzo Visconti; its <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> (1491) reflects the Lombard style, but with a marvellous variety of ornament and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>; it is divided into three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> by Gothic pillars; the <em>baldachina</em> of the altars of the side <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> are all of costly <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>; the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> are mostly by <a href="../cathen/02685b.htm">Borgognone</a>, although there are some by <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a>, <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Mantegna</a>, <a href="../cathen/12280a.htm">Pordenone</a>, and others; the choir stalls are of inlaid work; the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Gian Galeazzo and the figures taken from the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Lodovico il Moro and of his wife are the most beautiful productions of Lombard <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>.

<p>Among the secular buildings are: the Castello Visconteo (1360), despoiled by Louis XII, who carried away its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which grew out of the grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Roman and of Lombard law, enlarged by <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> and <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, with several colleges connected with it, viz. the Ghislieri college (<a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>), the Borromeo college (St. Charles), the Gandini college (St. Augustine), and others; and the Museo Civico has a picture gallery, a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and a collection of copper engravings.

<p>Pavia is the ancient <em>Ticinum</em>, founded by the Lievi and Marici, two Ligurian peoples; at a date not well determined it came under Roman power, and was given to the Papia tribe, whence the name of <em>Papia</em>, which, however, does not occur before the time of Paulus Diaconus. In <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 271, <a href="../cathen/02108b.htm">Emperor Aurelian</a> inflicted there a decisive defeat upon the Alamanni; the city was destroyed by Alaric (452); Odoacer, however, transformed it into a stronghold, and stationed there his Heruli and Rugii; <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> built a royal palace at Pavia, also an amphitheatre, therm&aelig; etc. Throughout the Gothic War, the city was held by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, although they were defeated in a battle near there in 538. Pavia resisted Alboin, King of the Lombards, for three years, and then became the capital of the Lombard Kingdom, and when it was taken from the Lombards by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (battles of Pavia of 754, 755, and 774), it remained the capital of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>, where the diets of that realm were held. In the tenth century, the Hungarians brought devastation upon the city on several occasions, especially in 924.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Pavia were famous in the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who took from there the grammarian Petrus Pisanus; in 825 a palatine <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was established in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Agostino, under the Irishman Dungal. In 901 <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> besieged Louis of Provence in Pavia. When Emperor <a href="../cathen/07227a.htm">St. Henry II</a>, after defeating Arduin of <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a> in 1004, was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at Pavia, the citizens rose against him, and set fire to the town. At his death they destroyed the imperial palace, and resisted Conrad the Salian for two years. The republican Government of the city began at this time, but the period of continual <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against neighbouring cities continued: <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1061, 1100), <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, Tortona (1109); Pavia, however, was almost always in alliance with <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>. On the other hand, it gave assistance to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1110 against <a href="../cathen/07232a.htm">Emperor Henry V</a>, and also in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a>, in 1127; but from the beginning of the reign of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>, it became strongly imperialist, while the emperors were prodigal in bestowing <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges upon the city, e.g. allowing it to elect its own consuls. The <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of Pavia were in great demand, while its agriculture and its industries flourished. The city was able in war-time to arm 15,000 infantry and 8000 mounted troops. Pavia remained <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> even under <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> (1227), and in 1241 its forces defeated the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Pontifical Crusaders</a> under Gregorio da Montelongo. In the second half of the thirteenth century contentions for the lordship of the city arose between the Langosco and the Beccaria <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>; and this made it possible for Matteo Visconti (1315) to occupy the town, for which, however, the marquesses of Montferrat also contended, until Galeazzo II Visconti in 1359 suppressed the brief popular government that was established by the Augustinian preacher, Jacopo Bussolari (1356-59). From that time on, Pavia belonged to the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>; the Sforzas, however, gave it a Government of its own. In 1499 Louis XII took the city, and thereafter severely punished an insurrection of the town against him. In 1524 Pavia was again besieged unsuccessfully by the French; and, in the following year, the battle that decided the Spanish domination of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> was fought there, for the taking of Pavia by Lautrec in 1527 had no important consequence. The town underwent another siege by the French in 1655. It was taken by the Austrians in 1706, and again by the French in 1733 and in 1745; the latter, however, were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave it to the Austrians in 1746 and Pavia followed the fortunes of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. In 1786, <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> established there one of the so-called "general seminaries", suppressed in 1791.

<p>Pavia is the birthplace of: the historian <a href="../cathen/09313a.htm">Liutprand</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>; St. Bernardo Balbi, a collector of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>; the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Andreino d'Edesia, a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>; the canon Zanella, inventor of the bassoon. The Gospel was brought to this city by St. Syrus, according to legend a disciple of St. Peter; but according to the <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of Ado, on the authority of an Aquileian <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a>, he was sent by St. Hermagoras, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. Admitting that Eventius, present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> in 381, was the sixth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pavia, it may well be that this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> dates from the second half of the third century; among its other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Ursicinus (before 397); St. Crispinus (432); <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (466), a providential blessing to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the time of Ricimer, Odoacer, and <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>; St. Maximus (496); Ennodius (511), a famous orator and poet, decorated by St. Hormisdas with the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>.

<p>After the Lombard occupation, there was also an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Pavia; he had the church of San Eusebio as <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; the last one of these was St. Anastasius, who <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and sole <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. After him were: St. Damianus, Biscossia (680), author of a letter against the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>; Armentarius (seventh century) who contended with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> regarding <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; St. Petrus (726), a relative of King Aripert, and therefore exiled in his youth by Grimoald; St. Theodorus (745), exiled for unknown reasons, returned only after the victories of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; Waldo (791), formerly <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>; St. Joannes (801); Joannes II (874), to whom <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, thereafter given to his successors; Joannes III (884), obtained the use of the cross and of the white horse; Pietro Canepanova (978), chancellor of <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, became <a href="../cathen/08427b.htm">Pope John XIV</a>; Gulielmo (1073), followed the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a>, and was deposed; Guido Pipari (1100), more of a warrior than a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>; Pietro Toscano (1148), a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>, friend of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> and of St. Thomas &agrave; Becket, expelled by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>, who held the <em>Conciliabulum</em> of Pavia against <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> in 1159; St. Lanfranc (1180) and St. Bernardo Balbi (1198), famous jurists and canonists; St. Fulco Scotti (1216); Guido de Langosco (1296), also a canonist; Isnardo Tocconi, O.P., administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> from 1311 to 1320 and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> as a suspect of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but acquitted; Gulielmo Centuaria (1386), O.

Ferr&eacute; (1859), for two years prevented by the new Government from taking possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Lucido M. Parrochi (1871-77), became a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
