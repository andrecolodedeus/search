<h1>Diocese of Pembroke</h1>  

<p>(PEMBROKIENSIS)

<p>A suffragan of <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The town of Pembroke has a beautiful location on the Ottawa River, about one hundred miles west of the City of Ottawa, in the midst of a rich farming and lumbering district. The locality is mentioned in the early history of <a href="../cathen/10378a.htm">Indian missions</a> in Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a>, when on a voyage of exploration of the Upper Ottawa, pitched his tent where now stands the Pembroke court house. The names of the early missionaries are lost, the first known being those of Fathers Dupins and Bellefeuille, <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, who preached to the Indians of this region in 1836. The foundation of the mission there is ascribed to Father Lynch, and the first resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was Father Gillie, under whose direction the first church was begun in 1847. This soon <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> inadequate and a more extensive stone structure was erected on a new site. In 1882 when Pembroke was chosen as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the new vicariate, plans, eventually carried out, were prepared to transform this church into the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Columba. The diocese of Pembroke comprises the county of Renfrew, part of each of the counties of Frontenac, Addington, Hastings, and Haliburton, of the district of Nipissing in the <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Province of Ontario</a>, and the southern part of the county of Pontiac in the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>. This territory was separated from the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13339b.htm">St. Boniface</a>, and erected into the Vicariate of Pontiac, 11 July, 1882. This immense district comprised a great portion of northern <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> and Quebec, extending as far north as Hudson Bay, and east to the district of <a href="../cathen/16049a.htm">Keewatin</a>. The work of colonization and development progressed so rapidly that, 4 May, 1898, the vicariate was erected into the Diocese of Pembroke with <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at Pembroke. The remarkable growth of the northern districts, principally through the discovery of immense mineral wealth of gold and silver in the now renowned cobalt region, led to the formation of a new vicariate at Tenniscanning, 22 September, 1908.

<p>Narcisse Zephyrin Lorrain, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pembroke, was born at St. Martin, Laval County, Quebec, 13 June, 1842. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was obtained in his own <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and in 1855 he began his classical studies in the College of St. Ther&egrave;se, from which he entered the Seminary of St. Ther&egrave;se. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, 4 August, 1867, by Bishop Bourget, for two years he filled the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of professor and director of his <a href="../cathen/01326c.htm">Alma</a> Mater. In 1869 with Bishop Bourget's consent, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Redford then in the <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Diocese of Albany</a>, New York. He was recalled to <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> in 1879 and in the following year was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Two years later he was chosen <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the new Vicariate of Pontiac, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cythera, 21 September, 1882, in the church of Notre Dame, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and on the following day entered Pembroke, where he was to take his residence as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Pontiac. When the vicariate was erected into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he became its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The works and progress of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> under the administration of Bishop Lorrain are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of his untiring energy, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>, and keen business ability. He visited the <a href="../cathen/10378a.htm">Indian missions</a> of the north five times. In 1884 he covered a distance of fifteen hundred miles to the missions of Abbitibbi, Moose Factory, and Albany, and in 1887 in visiting the missions of the <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> he made a voyage of seventeen hundred miles, which like the first and the other three, was for the most part made in canoe or on foot.

<p>The diocese numbers: about 37,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 27 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 15 assistant priests; missions, 34; stations 17, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 7. Of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> 38 are seculars and 4 <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>. Among the communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> connected with <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> are: the <a href="../cathen/07031b.htm">Grey Nuns of the Cross</a>, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, Sisters of Providence, <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>, Sisters of the Holy Family. Two large and well-equipped <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> are conducted by the first mentioned community. The separate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system enjoyed throughout the diocese gives to all a good opportunity for primary and religious instruction, while the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young men is obtained principally at the <a href="../cathen/11352b.htm">University of Ottawa</a>. There are 5 academies with 1200 pupils; 71 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 13,270 pupils.
