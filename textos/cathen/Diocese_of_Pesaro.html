<h1>Diocese of Pesaro</h1>  

<p>(PESAURENSIS)

<p>Located in central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated at the mouth of the river Foglia, on the Adriatic Sea. The industries of the town include fisheries, agriculture, the manufacture of majolicas, the working of sulphur and lignite coal mines, bituminous schist, and marble. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (San Francesco) has a beautiful Gothic portal and a "Coronation of the Madonna", by Bellini; the church of San Domenico is a work of Fra Paolo Belli; in the latter is the mausoleum of the poet Giulio Perticari. The Palazzo Ducale was begun by Laurana before 1465, and was finished by the Gengas, father and son. In the Almerici palace is a museum of ancient inscriptions, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> carvings, a collection of majolica, a small picture gallery, and the Olivieri <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. Beside the episcopal residence is the ancient <em>duomo</em>, now closed, and the remains of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nymph&aelig;um. Outside the city is the Villa Imperiale, built by Alessandro Sforza (1469). Among the scientific institutions mention should be made of the Liceo Musicale, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/13204b.htm">Rossini</a>, a native of Pesaro. Of the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylum</a> dates from 1257, and the retreat for penitent <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from 1619.

<p>At the beginning of the fourth century <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, Pesaro was occupied by the Senones, who were driven from there in 283. The town became a colony in 184. During the Gothic War, it underwent frequent sieges. In the eighth century Pesaro fell four times into the hands of the Lombards, and finally was annexed to the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>. <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Giovanni Malatesta</a>, the Lame, became <em>podest&agrave;</em> of Pesaro in 1285. Galeazzo Malatesta, having no children, gave Pesaro as a dower to his niece, Costansa Varano, wife of Alessandro Sforza, and the latter was confirmed in the possession of the city by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1447. Costanzo Sforza (1473) fought against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the service of Florence, and left the duchy to his natural son Giovanni (1481); the latter married Lucrezia Borgia, from whom he was eventually separated. Costanso II inherited the duchy in 1510, under the tutelage of his uncle Galeazzo, but in 1512 <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> gave Pesaro to Francesco M. della Rovere, Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, and the city remained united to this duchy, of which it became the capital. In 1860 the town was valiantly defended by 800 men of the Pontifical troops against the army of Cialdini, but it was compelled to surrender.

<p>The Blessed Francis of Pesaro (1350) and the Blessed Michelina Metelli (1356) were of this city; the first is buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and the second in the church of the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>; other natives of Pesaro were the Blessed Santo, O. Min., who died in 1393; Blessed Pietro Giacomo (1496), an Augustinian, and Blessed Serafina Sforza (1478), wife of the Duke Alessandro Sforza; at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is the body of the Blessed Felice Meda (died 1444). The people of Pesaro have great veneration for St. Terentius, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of uncertain date. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Florentius, is said to have governed this see in the middle of the second century, while the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Decentius, according to tradition, suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>; Bishop Heradianus was at the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> in 343. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Germanus, who went with Cresconius di Todi to Constantinople in 497 as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of Anastasius II; Felix, whom <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> brought to trial; Maximus (649); Benenatus, a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a> (680); Stabilinus (769); Adelberto (998), founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Tommaso in Folgia, where <a href="../cathen/04017a.htm">Clement II</a> died in 1047; Pietro (1070), who was deposed, being a partisan of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>; Bartolomeo (1218); Omodio (1346); Biagio Geminelli (1354); Leale Malatesta (1370), who was the first to convoke a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod; Cardinal Antonio Casini (1406); Giuio Simonetti (1560), was at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Gian Lucido Palombara (1658), <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Umberto Radicati (1742), held an important <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod; Cardinal Gennaro Ant. de' Simoni (1775); and Andrea Mastai-Ferretti (1806).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>; it has 39 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 47,000 inhabitants, 9 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, 7 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> for male students, and 4 for girls.
