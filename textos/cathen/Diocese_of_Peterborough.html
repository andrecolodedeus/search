<h1>Diocese of Peterborough</h1>  

<p>(PETERBOROUGHENSIS)

<p>Located in the <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Province of Ontario</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, comprises the Counties of Peterborough, Northumberland, <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, and Victoria, with the Districts of Muskoka and Parry Sound. It was erected by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 11 July, 1882, by detaching the four former counties from the <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Diocese of Kingston</a> and uniting them with the Vicariate of Northern <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, which then included the Districts of Muskoka, Parry Sound, Nipissing, Algoma, and Thunder Bay. Rt. Rev. John Francis Jamot, at that time <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Northern <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, was appointed first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The new diocese then extended about 1110 miles from south-east to northwest, and its southern limit reached to Lakes Superior and <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a>, the Georgian Bay, and a part of Lake Ontario. Bishop Jamot was born in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1828, and came to the <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Diocese of Toronto</a> in 1853. After serving in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Barrie for several years he was transferred to St. Michael's Cathedral, <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, and appointed chancellor and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1874 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13476a.htm">Sarepta</a> and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Northern <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where he displayed <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy in seeking out the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of his extensive vicariate. When in 1882 the Diocese of Peterborough was formed the total <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was about 30,000, of whom 5000 were Indians, with 47 churches and 25 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom 11 were <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> attending the western part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10378a.htm">Indian Missions</a>. After the erection of the Diocese of Peterborough in 1882 Bishop Jamot moved his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from Bracebridge to the city of Peterborough, where he died 4 May, 1886. Rt. Rev. Thomas Joseph Dowling, then Vicar General of the <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Diocese of Hamilton</a>, succeeded him and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1 May, 1887. He continued the many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> of his predecessor and after two years was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Diocese of Hamilton</a>. The third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Rt. Rev. Richard Alphonsus O'Connor, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1 May, 1889. He was horn at Listowel, Co. Kerry, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 15 April, 1838, came to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1841 with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and settled at <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>. He was one of the first students in St. Michael's College, <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, and made his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course in the Grand Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. On 2 August 1861 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in St. Michael's Cathedral Toronto, and, after serving in various <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, and for eighteen years as Dean of Barrie, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Peterborough by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 11 Jan., 1889.

<p>During the administration of Bishop O'Connor the western part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> increased rapidly in population, and, that religion might keep pace with the material progress of the country, many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were built. On account of the large influx of settlers into New Ontario, which embraced the western part of the Diocese of Peterborough, and the development of that district in agriculture, commerce, mining, and manufacturing industries, a brief <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 14 Nov., 1904, of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> constituted the new Diocese of Sault Ste Marie by detaching from the Diocese of Peterborough the western part of the District of Nipissing, with the Districts of Algoma and Thunder Bay. There was then a population of 27,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with 35 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 64 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, in the new Diocese of Sault Ste Marie; and 24,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with 29 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 45 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, in the portion left to Peterborough. The city of Peterborough has a population of about 18,000, about one-fourth of whom are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, with two churches, one <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, one House of Providence, an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, and the largest total abstinence <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, numbering over 1000 men. In the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, conducted chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, who have a motherhouse and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city, and have charge of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, House of Providence, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. They also conduct a select academy at Lindsay, besides directing the day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls. In Peterborough there are three large <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 19 teachers, 17 of whom are <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>. At present the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is about 26,000, with 29 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, 50 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, one House of Providence, and one <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>.
