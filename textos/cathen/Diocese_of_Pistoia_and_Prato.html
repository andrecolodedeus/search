<h1>Diocese of Pistoia and Prato</h1>  

<p>(PISTORIENSIS ET PRATENSIS)

<p>Located in the Province of Florence. The city of Pistoia is situated at the foot of the Apennines in the valley of the Ombrone. The chief industries of the town are the manufacture of paper and objects in straw. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dates from the fifth century, but was damaged by fire several times prior to the thirteenth century, when <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Nicol&ograve; Pisano</a> designed its present form; the outer walls are inlaid with bands of black and white marble; the tribune was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by <a href="../cathen/11521b.htm">Passignano</a> and by Sorri; the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Alessio d'Andrea and by Buonaccorso di Cino (1347), which were in the centre aisle, have disappeared. Other things to be admired, are the ancient <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, the cenotaphs of Cino da Pistoia and Cardinal Forteguerri, by Verrocchio, the altar of S. Atto, with its silver work, the <a href="../cathen/02274a.htm">baptismal font</a> by Ferrucci, and the equipments of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>. Opposite the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is S. Giovanni Rotondo, the former <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>; it is an octagonal structure, the work of <a href="../cathen/01470a.htm">Andrea Pisano</a> (1333-59), with decorations by Cellino di Nese; the font itself is a square base with four wells, surmounted by a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> by Andrea Vacc&agrave;. The church of S. Giovanni Fuoricivitas is surrounded, on the upper part, by two rows of arches; it is a work of the twelfth century; within, there is the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, with its <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by Fra Gulielmo d'Agnello, and the holy-water font, representing the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtues, by Giovanni Pisano. The name of Pistoia appears for the first time in history in connexion with the conspiracy of Catiline (62 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), but it was only after the sixth century that it became important; it was governed, first, by its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, later by stewards of the Marquis of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. It was the first to establish its independence, after the death of Countess Matilda, and its municipal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> are the most ancient of their kind in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. It was a <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> town, and had subjugated several cities and castles; but, after the death of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, the Florentines compelled it to become <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a>. About 1300, the Houses of the Cancellieri (Guelphs), and Panciatichi (Ghibellines), struggled with each other for supremacy. The former having triumphed it soon divided into Bianchi and Neri, which made it easy for Castruccio Castracane to subject the town to his domination, in 1328. Florence assisted the Pistoians to drive Castruccio from their town, but that aid soon weighed upon them, and they revolted (1343), taking part with <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. In 1351 Pistoia became definitively subject to Florence. <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> was a Pistoian.

<p>PRATO is also a city in the Province of Florence, situated in the fertile valley of the Bisenzio, which supports many industries, among them flour mills, woolen and silk manufactories, quarries, iron, and copper works. The Cicognani college of Prato is famous. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was erected before the tenth century, was restored in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, according to plans of Giovanni Pisano; it contains <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/09278a.htm">Fra Filippo Lippi</a> and by <a href="../cathen/06332b.htm">Gaddi</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> that is a masterpiece of <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a>, and the mausoleums of Carlo de'Medici and of <a href="../cathen/04633b.htm">Vincenzo Danti</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of la Cintola there is preserved a girdle that, according to the legend, was given by <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> to St. Thomas. Prato is first mentioned in history, in 1007, as being in rebellion against Florence; after that it had several <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with Florence and Pistoia. In 1350, it was bought by the Florentines, to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Visconti. In 1512, it was sacked by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. Fra Arlotto, author of the first Biblical concordance, was a native of Prato, as were also <a href="../cathen/02318a.htm">Fra Bartolommeo della Porta</a> and several personages of the Inghirami <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Pistoia claims to have received the Gospel from St. Romulus, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06070a.htm">Fiesole</a>. The first mention of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pistoia is in 492, though the name of this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, like that of another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pistoia, referred to in 516, is unknown. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Joannes (700); Leo (1067), important in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Henry IV; Jacobus (1118-41); the Blessed Atto (1135-53); Bonus (1189), author of "De cohabitatione clericorum et mulierum"; the Ven. Giovanni Vivenzi (1370); Matteo Diamanti (1400); Donato de'Medici (1436) Nicol&ograve; Pandolfini (1475), who later became a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; three Pucci, Cardinal Lorenzo (1516), Cardinal Antonio (1519) and Roberto (1541); Alessandro de'Medici (1573) became <a href="../cathen/09166a.htm">Leo XI</a>. In 1653, Prato was made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and united, <em>&oelig;que principaliter</em>, with Pistoia; as early as 1409, Florence asked for the creation of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> at Prato, on account of the dissensions of the collegiate church of Prato with the Bishops of Pistoia; and in 1460, it had been made a <em>prelatura nullius</em>, and given, as a rule, to some <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of these sees were the Ven. Gerardo Gerardi (1679-90), under whom Prato founded its <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Leone Strozza (1690), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Vallombrosa, founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Pistoia, enlarged by Michele C. Visdomini (1702); Scipione Ricci (1780), famous on account of the <a href="../cathen/12116c.htm">Synod of Pistoia</a> which he convened in 1786, and which <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> afterwards condemned. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is a suffragan of Florence; has 194 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 200,100 inhabitants, 5 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, and 19 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and 7 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> for girls.
