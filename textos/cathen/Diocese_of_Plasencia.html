<h1>Diocese of Plasencia</h1>  

<p>(PLACENTINA)

<p>Plasencia comprises the civil provinces of C&aacute;ceres, Salamanca, and <a href="../cathen/02193a.htm">Badajoz</a>. Its capital has a population of 8044. The city of Plasencia was founded by Alfonso VIII on the site of Ambroz, which he had conquered from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. He gave it the name of Placentia, "that it may be pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man" (ut Deo placeat et hominibus), and sought to have it made a see by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, which <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a> did in 1189. In 1190, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was occupied by Bricio and, at his death in 1211, by Domingo, a native of <a href="../cathen/02393a.htm">Beja</a>, who was more warrior than shepherd, fighting at Las Navas de Tolosa at the head of the men of Plasencia, and subsequently directing his movements against Ja&eacute;n, conquering Priego, Doja, Montejo, and other towns. He assisted at the Lateran Council of 1215, with Archbishop Rodrigo Jim&eacute;nez de Rada, whom he served as vicar when the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> became <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Dying in 1235, Domingo was succeeded by Adan, third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Plasencia, a no less warlike <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, who with four other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> accompanied St. Ferdinand to the conquest of C&oacute;rdoba, where the five <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the mosque as a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Christian cathedral</a>. His successors, Ximeno Simon, and two Pedros, devoted themselves mainly to the government of their diocese; Juan Alonso assisted at the Cortes of 1288, where he obtained from Sancho confirmation of the privileges already granted to Plasencia. His successor Diego spent much time at Valladolid with the king.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was originally built on a lofty site, near the citadel, afterwards occupied by the Church of St. Vincent the Martyr, then by that of St. Anne and lastly by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, now an almshouse. Another <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun early in the fourteenth century; this edifice, in the Early <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, is now the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a>. At the end of its <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> are seen the arms of Bishop Gonzalo de Sta. Maria, in whose time the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> was finished, and the first solemn procession was held there, 26 March, 1348. This <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> had hardly been built when it began to seem too poor for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> &mdash; one of the richest in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In 1498, in the episcopate of Gutierre Alvarez de Toledo, the twenty-fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, another <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun in Late Gothic, and completed in <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is the work of Gregorio Hern&aacute;ndez, a famous <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> of Valladolid; the choir grille was made by Juan Bautista Celma in 1604; the stalls are noteworthy, rivalling those of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02193a.htm">Badajoz</a>. In the sanctuary, on the Gospel side, is the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Bishop Pedro Ponce de Le&oacute;n, inquisitor general, who died at Jaraycedo, 18 January, 1573. In the winter <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter house</a> are a "Nativity" by Vel&aacute;zquez and a "St. Augustine" by Espa&ntilde;oleto. The adjoining college was founded in 1554 by Bishop Gutierre de Varagas de Carvajal, a native of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, one of the most notable occupants of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> Church of St. Nicolas, also at Plasencia, contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Hernan P&eacute;rez de Monroy, the champion of King Pedro I, and Pedro de Carvajal, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363a.htm">Coria</a>. The Church of S. Juan Bautista, outside the walls, has been converted into a match factory. The noteworthy church of S. Vicente formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>; in its <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. John is the magnificent <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> with kneeling effigy of Martin Nieto, <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> commander of the nine towns, in the Order of St. John, and <em>comendador</em> of Yebenes.

<p>The episcopal palace was rebuilt at the expense of Bishop Francisco Laso de La Vega (1737), on the site of one that dated from the fifteenth century. Besides the almshouse already mentioned, there are the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of Sta. Maria, popularly known as Do&ntilde;a Engracia de Monroy, which was restored by Bishop Laso; and the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of La Merced, known as Las Llagas (The Wounds), intended for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> suffering from wounds or accidental injuries. The <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Pur&iacute;sima Concepci&oacute;n was founded in 1670 by Bishop Diego Sarmiento Valladares and, later on, reorganized by Bishops Antonio Carillo Mayoral and Cipriano Varela. In 1853 Bishop Jos&eacute; Avila y Lamas installed it in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of S. Vicente.

<p>The Diocese of Plasencia was formerly suffragan of Santiago, but under the last concordat (1851) it became suffragan of Toledo. In this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the famous <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Yuste, to which <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> retired after his abdication. The ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> itself has been destroyed, but the dwelling built for the emperor is preserved, as well as the church. In 1547 the Count and Countess of Oropesa caused this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to be rebuilt in <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> architecture. The vaultings of the church were reconstructed in 1860; above them are white-washed walls with the emperor's arms, on one side, and on the other, a black wooden casket which contained the body of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, in a leaden case, until 1574, when it was removed to the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>. Plasencia has had many distinguished sons; among them <a href="../cathen/03393c.htm">Juan de Carvajal</a>, created a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, filled many important posts under the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and rendered important services at the Council of Basle and in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, while his cousin, <a href="../cathen/03393a.htm">Bernardino de Carvajal</a>, presided in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a> which elected <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a> and <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>. Among others were the jurists, Alfonso de Acevedo and Juan Gutti&eacute;rrez; the chroniclers Lorenzo Galindez de Carvajal and Alonso Fern&aacute;dez; and Diego de Chaves, confessor to Philip II. Within this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the native home of the conquerors of America: <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Hernando Cort&eacute;s</a>, a native of the village of <a href="../cathen/10116b.htm">Medell&iacute;n</a>; and the Pizarros, natives of <a href="../cathen/15070b.htm">Trujillo</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Plasencia were lords of Jaraycejo, the town of Miajadas, and other domains.
