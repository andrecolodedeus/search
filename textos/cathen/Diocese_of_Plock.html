<h1>Diocese of Plock</h1>  

<p>(PLOCENSIS)

<p>Located in Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, includes the district of Plock and parts of the districts of Lomza and <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>. Apparently the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was founded about 1087, through the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>; the first certain notice of it is of the year 1102, when Duke Ladislaus Hermann was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Plock. The diocese included the region between the rivers, Vistula, Narew, and Bug, and extended as far as the northern and eastern boundaries of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> of that era. At a later date the strip of land north of the Drewenz River was added to it. It therefore included the greater part of the Duchy of Masovia and the northern part of Podlachia; but was much smaller than the two other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> &mdash; Gnesen and Posen &mdash; then existing in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were under the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> authority of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>. The endowment of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was very large; according to a charter of Duke Conrad of Masovia, in 1239 the episcopal landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> included 240 <em>vill&oelig;</em> and at a later date also 20 <em>pr&oelig;dia</em>. In the thirteenth century these estates were divided between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. The Partitions of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> gave the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and a smaller portion to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>; since the publication by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De salute animarum" of 1821, the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> section of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has been incorporated in the Diocese of Kulm. In the readjustment of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> Warsaw was raised to an archdiocese, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Militantis ecclesi&aelig;" of 12 March, 1817, and the other Russo-Polish <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were made suffragan to it by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex impensa nobis" of 30 June, 1818. Consequently Plock also was transferred from its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> to Warsaw; at the same time five deaneries were taken from it, thereby reducing the diocese to its present size. Those estates of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> that had not been secularized before this date were taken one after the other by the Russian Government. The Diocese of Plock shared in the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> during the years 1853-63 and 1885-90; of late years the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Mariavites, with the aid of the Government, has spread in the diocese. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the present era, George Szembek (1901-03) and Apollinaris Wnukowski (1904-08) were elevated to the <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Archdiocese of Mohileff</a>; the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Anthony Julian Nowowiejski, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 6 December, 1908. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Plock was rebuilt after a fire in the years 1136-44, and thoroughly restored in 1903.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into 12 deaneries and at the end of 1909 included, besides the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, 249 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 31 dependent churches, 275 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 5 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 794,100 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. As early as 1207 the chapter consisted of 5 dignitaries and 10 canons; since the publication of the imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1865 it has consisted of 4 <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> (<a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, dean, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, and a "scholasticus") and 8 canons. There is also a collegiate chapter at Pultusk consisting of 3 <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and 4 canons. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> has been in existence since 1708; it has 10 professors and 72 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and there are also 4 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in the Roman Catholic Academy at St. Petersburg. The only houses of the orders in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Obory with 5 fathers and 1 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>; a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Clarisses at Przasnysz, with 9 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; 5 houses of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> with 25 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, who have charge of 4 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>.
