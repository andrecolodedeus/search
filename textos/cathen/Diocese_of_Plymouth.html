<h1>Diocese of Plymouth</h1>  

<p>(PLYMUTHENSIS, PLYMUTH&AElig;)

<p>Plymouth consists of the County of Dorset, which formed a portion of the old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Diocese of Salisbury</a>, whose last ruler, <a href="../cathen/11785a.htm">Cardinal Peto</a>, died in March, 1558; also of the Counties of Devon and Cornwall with the Scilly Isles, which formed the ancient <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Diocese of Exeter</a>, whose last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, James Turberville, died on 1 November, 1570. Since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> these counties have, with more or less of the rest of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, been governed by three archpriests and fourteen <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, the last of whom, called <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Western District (1848), was William Hendren, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15208b.htm">Uranopolis</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Universalis Ecclesi&aelig;" (29 September, 1850), <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> separated the three counties from the Western District and formed them into the new Diocese of Plymouth: the rest of the district to be the new <a href="../cathen/04058c.htm">Diocese of Clifton</a>, to which Bishop Hendren was forthwith translated, and the Diocese of Plymouth was placed under his temporary administration.

<p>Reverend George Errington (1804-86) of St. John's Church, <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a>, was appointed by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Plymouth, and on 25 July, 1851, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> there, together with the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a>, by <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>. On 7 August he was installed at St. Mary's church, East Stonehouse, Devon, which mission included its neighbour, Plymouth, wherein no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> place of worship existed. In this <em>Ultima thule</em> and poor district he found 17 secular and 6 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 23 missions including three institutes of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. No railways had reached the diocese except the Great Western to Plymouth, and a short mining railway established between Truro and Penzance at the extreme of Cornwall. A goodly number of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> did not belong to the diocese but were temporarily accepted. On 26 November, 1853, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> established his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, consisting of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and, by permission from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the above difficulties, seven instead of ten canons for the time. In February, 1854, he held a synod at Ugbrooke Park, the seat of Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, and, amongst his synodal acts, established a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> conference with its dean for each county. By 30 March, 1855, he had traversed the whole diocese for purpose of visitation and conferring confirmation, when bulls from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15028a.htm">Trebizond</a> and Coadjutor <em>cum jure successionis</em> to <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> of Westminster. William Vaughan (1814-1902), Canon of the Clifton Diocese, was nominated second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Plymouth, and on 16 September, 1855, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> in Clifton pro-cathedral. Encouraged by generous offers of assistance from Edmund Polifex Bastard of Kitley, Yealmpton, Devon, and from Miss Letitia Trelawny of Cornwall, Bishop Vaughan on 28 June, 1856, laid the foundation stone of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Our Immaculate Lady and St. Boniface, Apostle of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (born at Crediton, Devon), solemnly opened it on 25 March, 1858, and on 22 September, 1880, in the twenty-fifth year of his episcopate, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the Cathedral. attended the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> throughout, in 1869-70. Between 10-12 March, 1888, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, by a triduum of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, celebrated the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> Golden Jubilee of fifty years' <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. By the end of 1891 the Diocese of Plymouth, through the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> energetic supervision, became well established. It had 49 secular and 48 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 52 public churches, and 15 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of communities, as well as ten orders of men and sixteen of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Early in 1891 Bishop Vaughan requested from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a coadjutor-bishop. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> elected, from the Plymouth Chapter's <em>terna</em>, Charles Graham (1834), canon of Plymouth, on 25 September, 1891. On 28 October following he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cisamos, with right of succession, by Bishop Clifford of <a href="../cathen/04058c.htm">Clifton</a>, in the Plymouth <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Bishop Vaughan retired to St. Augustine's Priory, Newton Abbot, Devon, where, on 24 October, 1902, he died in his eighty-ninth year, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> cemetery. In October, 1902, Dr. Graham became third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Plymouth. Between 19 and 21 December, 1907, the diocese celebrated with a triduum the fiftieth anniversary of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>: on this occasion he added a fresh member to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. After a severe illness in 1910, Bishop Graham tendered his resignation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, which was accepted 9 Feb., 1911.

<p>The recent expulsion of religious from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> has, during 1910, raised the number of communities of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to twenty-nine. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is about one in a hundred, that is, 12,000, most of whom, being employed in the Government Army and Navy establishments, reside in Plymouth, Stonehouse, and Devonport. It is worthy of note that Bishop John Carroll of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, founder of the Hierarchy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>, was on 15 August, 1790, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Lulworth Church, Dorset, by <a href="../cathen/15539b.htm">Bishop Walmesley</a>, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Western District. The Faith never failed during the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> at Lanherne, Cornwall, and at Chideock, Dorset, through the fidelity of the <a href="../cathen/01765c.htm">Lords Arundell</a>. <a href="../cathen/10087a.htm">Blessed Cuthbert Mayne</a>, the protomartyr of pontifical seminarists, was a native of Devon.
