<h1>Diocese of Port Augusta</h1>  

<p>(PORTAUGUSTANA)

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is a suffragan of Adelaide, South Australia, created in 1887. Its boundaries are: north, the twenty-fifth degree of S. latitude; east, the States of Queensland and New South Wales; west, the State of West <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>; south, the counties Musgrave, Jervois, Daly, Stanley, Light, Eyre, and the River Murray. As the limits originally fixed were found insufficient, the counties of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a> and Burra were added. At its inception the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was heavily burdened with <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, numbering about 11,000, became much diminished owing to the periodical droughts to which a large portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is subject. The town of Port Augusta commands a splendid position at the head of Spencer's Gulf, overlooking which is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, a fine stone edifice. Its <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is still small, but is bound to increase when the great overland railways to West <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a> and to Port Darwin in the far Northern Territory become linked together.

<p>Right Rev. John O'Reily, D.D. (today <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01140a.htm">Adelaide</a>), <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a> at <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> 1 May, 1888, was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Port Augusta. His chief work was liquidating the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>, especially that of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He introduced the <a href="../cathen/06647b.htm">Sisters of the Good Samaritan</a> from <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> to Port Pirie in 1890. On 5 January, 1895, he was transferred to Adelaide as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Right Rev. James Maher, D.D. (died at Pekina, 20 December, 1905), first <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, then administrator <em>sede vacante</em>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/01140a.htm">Adelaide</a>, 26 April, 1896. His episcopate was marked by a succession of fully nine years of drought, which extended over the larger portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Owing to this disaster it was impossible to make much material progress, but the finances of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were kept steadily in view. The third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and present occupant of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, Right Rev. John Henry Norton, D.D. (born at <a href="../cathen/02223a.htm">Ballarat</a>, <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>, 31 Dec., 1855), was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/01140a.htm">Adelaide</a>, 9 December, 1906. He is the first native of <a href="../cathen/02223a.htm">Ballarat</a> to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the first Victorian, and the third Australian, native to be raised to the episcopate. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in that city and afterwards engaged in the study and practice of architecture for four years. In 1872 he entered St. Patrick's College, <a href="../cathen/10155a.htm">Melbourne</a>, became an undergraduate of <a href="../cathen/10155a.htm">Melbourne</a> University, and on 10 June, 1876, received <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> from Archbishop Goold. Early in 1878 he became affiliated to the then Diocese of Adelaide under Right Rev. C. A. Reynolds, D.D., and was sent by him to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to finish his studies. After a year at St. Kieran's College, Kilkenny, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he was admitted to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Cardinal Monaco la Valetta in St. John Lateran's, 8 April, 1882. Returning to <a href="../cathen/01140a.htm">Adelaide</a>, February, 1883, he was engaged at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> until January, 1884, when he was appointed first resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the new district of Petersburg, where he has resided ever since. He was made <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultor in 1894, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> under Dr. Maher, 2 May, 1896, administrator <em>sede vacante</em> on the latter's death, and appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 18 August, 1906. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a>, <a href="../cathen/01140a.htm">Adelaide</a>, by Most Rev. Michael Kelly, D.D., Coadjutor <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> on 9 December, 1906. As <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he erected a church, presbytery, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Petersburg, also churches at Dawson, Nackara, Lancelot, Yongala, Teetulpa, Renmark, Farina, and other places. He published three "Reports on the liabilities of the Diocese". He has recently completed a successful campaign for the final liquidation of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and Kooringa church <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>. During his episcopate churches have been erected at Warnertown, Hammond, and Wilmington, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at Caltowie, Jamestown, and Georgetown.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into nine districts (not including the West Coast from Talia to West <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, which is visited from Port Lincoln in the archdiocese), namely, Port Augusta, Carrieton, Hawker, Georgetown, Jamestown, Kooringa, Pekina, Petersburg, and Port Pirie. There are 10 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 34 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, two <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> &mdash; the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, numbering 33, and the <a href="../cathen/06647b.htm">Sisters of the Good Samaritan</a>, numbering 9. The former have <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in Port Augusta, Gladstone, Jamestown, Caltowie, Kooringa, Pekina, Quorn, Georgetown, and Petersburg; the latter are established at Port Pirie only, where they manage two primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, including a boarding and select <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The children in these thirteen <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> number 754. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> had resident missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Port Pirie, Kooringa, Georgetown, and Jamestown, long before the formation of the territory into a new diocese. As circumstances permitted, they relinquished Port Pirie in November, 1890, Kooringa in September, 1899, and Jamestown and Georgetown in September, 1900. Schools are maintained in 24 different places, the aggregate cost of salaries and general maintenance being estimated at &pound;27,500 in the last twenty years, the original cost of the buildings at &pound;18,250, or a total expenditure of &pound;45,750 by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, which, according to the census of 1901, is estimated at 11,953.
