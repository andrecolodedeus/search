<h1>Diocese of Porto and Santa-Rufina</h1>  

<p>(PORTUENSIS ET SANCT&AElig; RUFIN&AElig;)

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was formed from the union of two <a href="../cathen/14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Porto, now a wretched village, was in ancient times the chief harbour of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It owes its origin to the port built by Claudius on the right of the Tiber, opposite <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>; <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> enlarged the basin, and in a short time there grew around it a city which soon became independent of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. It was near Porto that Julius Nepos compelled Emperor Glycerius to abdicate (474). During the Gothic War the town served the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> (537 and 549) and the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> (546-52) as a base of operations against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the ninth and tenth centuries it was sacked on several occasions by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. In 849 <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> fortified it and established there a colony of <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsicans</a> for the defence of the coast and the neighbouring territory; but the city continued to decay. Naturally <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was early established there. Several <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Porto are known, including Herculanus, Hyacinthus, Martialis, Saturninus Epictetus, Maprilis and Felix. The place was also famous as the probable see of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a>. In 314 Gregorius was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The great <em>xenodochium</em>, or hospice, of Pammachius was built about 370. Among the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be mentioned Donatus (date uncertain), who built the basilica of St. Eutropius; Felix, a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>; Joannes, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a> (680); Gregorius, who accompanied Pope Constantine to Constantinople (710); Gregorius II (743-61); Citonatus, present at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Constantine (767); Radoaldus, who acted contrary to his instructions on the occasion of the difficulties with Photius at Constantinople (862), and who was deposed for having prevaricated in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> of Lothair II of Lorraine; Formosus, who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (891); Benedictus (963), who <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/09160b.htm">Leo VIII</a>; Gregorio (c. 991), who built the irrigation system of the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; <a href="../cathen/02428e.htm">Benedict VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Porto; Mauritius (1097), sent by Paschal II to establish order in religious affairs in the Holy Land; <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> (1119-24), who united to the See of Porto the other <a href="../cathen/14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> See of Silva Candida or Santa Rufina.

<p>Santa Rufina grew up around the basilica of the Holy Martyrs Sts. Rufina and Secunda on the Via Aurelia, fourteen miles from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the basilica is said to have been begun by <a href="../cathen/08561a.htm">Julius I</a>, and was finished by Saint Damasus. In the ninth century this town was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, and the efforts of <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Sergius III</a> were unable to save it from total ruin: all that remains are the remnants of the ancient basilica and a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The first notice of it as an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> dates from the fifth century, when its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Adeodatus was present at the councils held by Pope Symmachus; its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> St. Valentinus, Vicar of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the absence of Vigilius, had his hands cut off by Totila. Among its other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> mention should be made of Tiberius (594), Ursus (680), Nicetas (710), Hildebrand (906), and Peter (1026), whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the Leonine City, the Trastevere, and the Insula Tiberina (island in the Tiber) was confirmed. The residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Silva Candida was on the Insula Tiberina beside the church of Sts. Adalbert and Paulinus, while that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Porto was on the same island near the church of San Giovanni. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Silva Candida, moreover, enjoyed great prerogatives in relation with the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">basilica of St. Peter</a>. The most famous of these <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> was Cardinal Humbertus, who accompanied <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> from <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> by that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but, having been prevented by the Normans from landing on the island, he received the See of Silva Candida, and later was sent to Constantinople to settle the controversies aroused by <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a>. He wrote against the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Greeks and against <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> (1051-63). The last Bishop was Mainardus. Historically, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Porto became the second <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> being the first, and officiated on Mondays in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>; he obtained, moreover, the other <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Santa Rufina, but lost <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the Leonine City and its environs, when they were united to the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Among its better known <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a> are: Peter (1119), a partisan of <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a>; Theodevinus (1133), a German, sent on many missions to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and to the Holy Land; Bernardus (1159), who exerted himself to bring about peace between <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>; Theodinus (1177), who examined the cause of St. Thomas &agrave; Becket; Cencio Savelli (1219); Conrad (1219), a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>; Romano Bonaventura (1227), who obtained the confirmation of all the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>; Ottone Candido (1243), of the house of the marchesi di Monferrato, sent on several occasions as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> to <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>; <a href="../cathen/08644a.htm">Robert Kilwardby</a>, formerly <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, poisoned at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> (1280); Matteo da Acquasparta (1290), a former general of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and a renowned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>; Giovanni Minio (1302), a general of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; Giacomo Arnaldo d'Euse (1312), who became <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a>; Pietro Corsini (1374), who adhered, later, to the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>; Louis, Duke of Berry, created in 1412 by <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>.

<p>During the incumbency of Francesco Condulmer, <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> separated the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of Porto and Silva Candida, and gave the latter to <a href="../cathen/08616b.htm">John Kemp</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, at whose death (1445) the sees were reunited. Then came Guillaume d'Estouteville(1455); Rodrigo Borgia (1476), who became <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Pope Alexander VI</a>; Raff&aelig;gRiaria (1508); Gian Pietro Carafa (1553), who became <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Pope Paul IV</a>; Giovanni Morone (1565); Cristoforo Madruzzi (1570); Alessandro Farnese (1578); Fulvio Corneo (1580); <a href="../cathen/02738a.htm">Francesco M. Brancati</a> (1666); Ulderico Carpegna (1675), who left a legacy to defray the expenses of quadrennial missions; Carlo Rossetti (1680); Alderano Cibo (1683); Pietro Ottoboni (1687), who became <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Pope Alexander VIII</a>; Flavio Chigi (1693), who enlarged the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and richly furnished it; <a href="../cathen/01096b.htm">Nicol&oacute; Acciaiuolo</a> (1700); Vicenzo M. Orsini (1715), who became <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Pope Benedict XIII</a>; Giulio della Somaglia (1818); <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Bartolommeo Pacca</a> (1821). In 1826, <a href="../cathen/03798b.htm">Civitavecchia</a> was separated from the <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Diocese of Viterbo and Toscanella</a> and united with that of Porto, but in 1854, with Corneto, it was made an independent <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Mention should be made of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal Bishop</a> of Porto Luigi, <a href="../cathen/08760b.htm">Lambruschini</a> (1847), who restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the episcopal palace. From the sixteenth century, the incumbency of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of this see was, as a rule, of short duration, because most of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a> preferred the <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">See of Ostia and Velletri</a>, which they exchanged for their own as soon as possible. The Diocese of C&aelig;re, now Cervetri, has been united with that of Porto since the twelfth century. C&aelig;re was an ancient city, called at first Agylla, where the sanctuaries of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Vestals were hidden during the invasion of the Gauls; the Etruscan <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> scattered about its territory are important archeologically. Cervetri had <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of its own until the eleventh century; the first was Adeodatus (499), assuming that he was not the Adeodatus who signed himself <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Silva-Candida in the third synod of Pope Symmachus (501). The last known was Benedictus, referred to in 1015 and 1029. The Diocese of Porto and Santa Rufina has 18 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 4600 inhabitants.
