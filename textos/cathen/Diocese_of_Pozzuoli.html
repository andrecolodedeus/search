<h1>Diocese of Pozzuoli</h1>  

<p>(PUTEOLANA)

<p>The city of Pozzuoli in the province of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, on the gulf of the same name, was founded by the Cum&aelig;ans, whose port it became, under the name of Dic&aelig;archia. It was used by the Carthaginians in the Second Punic War. The Romans took possession of it, fortified it, and gave it the name of Puteoli. Hannibal sought in vain to take this place, which became a Roman colony in 194 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> and was thereafter the most important port of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, enjoying exceptional municipal liberties. The harbour was set off from the sea by a line of pilasters supporting a long arcade, which was restored later by <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antonius Pius</a>. Caligula connected the ports of Pozzuoli and of Bai&aelig; with a pontoon bridge. In the third century Pozzuoli fell into decadence. In 410, it was besieged and sacked by Alaric, in 545 by Totila, and in 715 by Grimoaldo II, Duke of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, who, however, did not succeed in taking it from its Byzantine masters; in the tenth century, it was several times the object of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> incursions. In 1014 Pozzuoli was taken by the Neapolitans, and later passed, with <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, into the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. In 1448 and 1538, it suffered from severe earthquakes; in 1550 the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> landed and wrought frightful havoc in the town. Abundant ruins of villas and <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> attest its ancient splendour. Among the temple ruins, the most important are those of the Temple of Serapis, which was at once a temple and an establishment of therapeutic baths; there remain the <a href="../cathen/03488a.htm">cella</a> and many of its columns, also sixteen bath-rooms for baths in the mineral water that flows near by. The work of excavation (1838) exposed the ruins of an amphitheatre that had a capacity of 30,000; there are also the ruins of a theatre, and of therm&aelig; or hot baths, where was found, among other objects, the Venus Anadyomene of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> Museum. The object of greatest interest at Pozzuoli, however, are the sulphur caves, the "forum Vulcani" of the ancients, which, through crevices in the earth exude sulphuretted hydrogen and sulphurous acid. in 1190 there was a severe volcanic eruption from these caves. There are also four mineral springs, and two caverns, known as the "Grotta del Cane", which exudes carbonic acid and the "Grotta dell' Ammoniaca"

<p>On his voyage to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> landed at Pozzuoli, where he met some "brothers" (<a href="../bible/act028.htm#vrs13">Acts 28:13-14</a>), and among these <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> there may have been <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the Apostle took advantage of the opportunity to preach to his countrymen the mystery of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> already come. That St. Patrobas, a disciple of St. Paul, was first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pozzuoli is a fabrication of the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheos</a>; on the other hand, the Bishops St. Celsus and St. Joannes governed the diocese before the fourth century. Proculus, Acutius, Eutyches, and St. Artemas were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Pozzuoli, and <a href="../cathen/08295a.htm">St. Januarius of Benevento</a> and his companions suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> here. In the fourth century the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this see was Florentius, against whom Pope Damasus was compelled to seek the assistance of the emperors. Bishop St. Theodorus died in 435; Julianus was pontifical <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">Robber Council of Ephesus</a> in 449; the Bishop Stephanus, whom Cappelletti names at this period, should be referred to the seventh century, or later. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Gaudiosus (680); St. Leo (about 1030), later a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>; Ludovico di Costanzo, who, with the assistance of Alfonso of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, was at first a usurper of this see, but was later recognized by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>; Carlo Borromeo (1537), a relative of the <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">saint of the same name</a>; Gian Matteo Castaldi (1542), who rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Lorenzo Mongevio (1617), a good orator, formerly Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and of Valencia (he was a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>), <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> accused, and held <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in Castel Sant' Angelo; Martin Leon y Cardenas (1619), to whom a public monument was erected, in recognition of his many merits. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> rises on the ruins of the Temple of Augustus; it contains some good pictures, among them the Martirio di San Gennaro by <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>. The churches of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> delle Grazie and of Santa Croce are worthy of note. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; has 10 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 57,100 inhabitants, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious house</a> of men, and 3 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishment</a> for girls.
