<h1>Diocese of Prince Albert</h1>  

<p>A suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of St. Boniface, <a href="../cathen/09602a.htm">Manitoba</a>, in the Province of Saskatchewan, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Originally part of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a>, it was formed, 4 June, 1891, into the Vicariate Apostolic of the Saskatchewan, bounded in the south by 52&deg; 30' N. lat., in the west by 109&deg; W. long., in the east by the present boundaries of the province of the same name, and in the north by the Arctic Sea. On 2 Dec., 1907, most of this was erected into the Diocese of Prince Albert, and Rt. Rev. Albert Pascal, O.M.I., became its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is bounded on the south by a line passing between the thirtieth and the thirty-first township, approximately 51&deg; 30' N. lat. Its western and eastern limits are coincident with the boundaries of the civil province as far north as the sixtieth township (about 54&deg; 20') in the west, and the fifty-second township (or 53&deg; 30') in the east, thus forming in the north a line of demarcation with two right angles just half way between its eastern and western limits.

<p>Fort Canton within that territory had been periodically visited by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries ever since 1842. In 1870 Father Moulin was put in charge of the French half-breed <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> who had settled on the banks of the south branch of the Saskatchewan. In 1874 the permanent mission of St. Laurent was established by Father Andr&eacute;, who was replaced in Nov., 1877, by Father Lestanc, the real founder of that missionary post on the south branch of the Saskatchewan. Then followed the missions of St. Anthony, at Batoche, established in 1881 by Father V&eacute;greville, succeeded by Father Moulin, and of Prince Albert, started by Father Andr&eacute; in 1882. The first missionaries of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>. The uprising of the dissatisfied population in 1885 resulted in the battles of Fish Creek and Batoche, the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of two missionaries by Plains Crees, the destruction of several missionary establishments, and the capture and execution of the half-breed leader, Louis Riel. St. Louis de Langevin was founded by Father Lecocq in 1886. The advent of railways prompted the foundation of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and farming settlements, of which the most important is the German colony of St. Peter, founded in 1903 by the Very Rev. Bruno Doerfler, O.S.B., now attended by several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the same order.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is estimated (1911) at 45,000, of whom some 15,000 follow the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Rite. The French have 18 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and number 11,050; the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> are between 10,500 and 11,000, distributed in 12 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; while the English-speaking population, about 3100, have 4 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of their own. In other centres the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are of mixed nationalities. There are also some 1000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Crees, whose spiritual needs are attended to by French Oblates established on, or near, their reserves. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of all these <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, whether public or separate, are equally satisfactory but not up to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ideal (see SASKATCHEWAN). Saskatoon has 15,000 inhabitants, and Prince Albert, 8000. The diocese counts 28 Oblate fathers, 22 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 14 <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, and 6 communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. It has 42 academies and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and 2 boarding-schools for Indians with 130 pupils.
