<h1>Diocese of Przemysl, Sambor, and Sanok</h1>  

<p>(PREMISLIENSIS, SAMBORIENSIS, ET SANOCHIENSIS)

<p>A Gr&aelig;co-Ruthenian <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> diocese of Western Galicia, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. It is really the <a href="../cathen/12532a.htm">Diocese of Przemysl</a> (Ruthenian, Peremyshl) of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, since the See of Sambor represents only a former contest between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the Orthodox about the time of the union of the churches, and there never was at any time a Bishopric of Sanok. Przemysl is a fortified town situated on the River San, in the Crownland of Galicia, about fifty-four miles west of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>. Its population in 1900 was 46,350, and it contains the Cathedral Church of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Sambor is a manufacturing town situated about ten miles away upon the River Dniester; it had in 1900 some 17,350 inhabitants. Sanok is a still smaller town, situated on the River San about twenty-five miles southwest of Przemysl, and has about 5000 inhabitants. The original <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of Przemysl was a church connected with the great castle, but this was given to the Latins by King Wladislaw in 1412. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> then took the present Church of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist for their <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of Sambor, dedicated to the Transfiguration, is situated near the town of Old Sambor. All this part of the country was the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and on its partition the <a href="../cathen/12532a.htm">Diocese of Przemysl</a> fell to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The present Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into 40 deaneries, containing 688 organized <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 1334 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and 2 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Greek <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> consists of 803 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, as follows: 662 married, 129 widowers, and 12 <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibates</a>, together with 36 monastic <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is 1,198,398.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12532a.htm">Diocese of Przemysl</a> stretched over a large part of Red <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, covering some 900 square miles, west of the <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Archdiocese of Lemberg</a>. It is perhaps the oldest of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and Sts. Cyril and Methodius are said to have preached <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> there. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that this part of south-west <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> received <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> nearly one hundred years before the conversion of King Vladimir at Kieff. The names of its early missionary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are lost, but from 1218 the succession is unbroken. Antonius (1218-25) is the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whose name is recorded. He was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Novgorod, but was banished from there and then became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Przemysl, succeeding a former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who had just died. King Danilo at this time was in union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and for over one hundred years the Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Przemysl were likewise united with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Hilarion (1254), Abraham (1271), Jeremias (1282), Memnon (1288), Hilarion (1292), George (1315), Mark (1330), Cyril (1353), Hilarion (1366), Basil (1385), <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> (1392), and Gelasius (1412) ruled this see during its peace with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1416 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Przemysl embraced the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Elias (1422) was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who took the title Przemysl and Sambor. The See of Sambor was founded in the thirteenth century, and shortly afterwards the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were united, although the double name was not used until assumed by Elias. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> (1440-49) opposed the union of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>. The succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Przemysl adhered to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and remained <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> for over a century.

<p>In 1594 Bishop Michael Kopystynski (1591-1610) took up the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of reunion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and added his name to the declaration of union at the Synod of Brest. Later he withdrew it and was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff, Michael Ragosa. His successor, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> Krupetzki (1610-52), was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Meanwhile the schismatics elected another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and drove out <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>; and for nearly a century there was a double line of Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the Orthodox holding the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at Przemysl, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> holding it at Sambor. In 1668 the Orthodox coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, George Hoshovski, took up his residence at Sanok, and from that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Przemysl, Sambor, and Sanok was assumed, although no see was established at Sanok. The succeeding <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Procopius Chmelovski (1652), Anthony Terletzki (1662), and John Malachovski (1669). The next Orthodox <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Innocent Vinnitzki (1680-1700), and during his administration the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Bishop Malachovski left his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and went to <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, where he died in 1691. From the time of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> Bishop Innocent had announced his intention of uniting with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He prepared his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for the union, and on 23 June, 1691, he renounced the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and signed the act of union. Since then the Greek <a href="../cathen/12532a.htm">Diocese of Przemysl</a> has always been <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. In 1694 the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod of the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> was held at Sambor, where the new situation of the Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was canonically established. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> succeeding him were George Vinnitzki (1700-13), Jerome Ustritzki (1715-46), Onuphrius Shumlanski (1746-62), <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> Szepticki (1762-79), Maximilian Ryllo (1780-94), and Anton Angelovich (1795-1808). The see remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> from 1808 until 1813, during the Napoleonic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, but was administered by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, the well-known historian of the Greek Uniats, Michael Harasievich, The succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Michael Levitzki (1813-16), John Snigurski (1818-47), Gregor Jachimovich (1848-59), Thomas Polanski (1860-69), John Stupnitzki (1872-90), and Julian Pelesz (1891-96), the renowned author of the "History of the Union of the Ruthenian Church with Rome". The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1911) is Constantine Chekhovich.
