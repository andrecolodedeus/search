<h1>Diocese of P&eacute;rigueux</h1>  

<p>(PETROCORICENSIS)

<p>Comprises the Department of Dordogne and is suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Archbishopric of Bordeaux</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, the Dioceses of P&eacute;rigueux and Sarlat were united to the <a href="../cathen/01513b.htm">See of Angoul&ecirc;me</a>; in 1821 P&eacute;rigueux was again the seat of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> which united the former Dioceses of P&eacute;rigueux and Sarlat, excepting 60 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> given to Agen and Angoul&ecirc;me and 49 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> which had once belonged to <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15086c.htm">Tulle</a>.

<p>The Martyrology of Ado gives St. Front as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of P&eacute;rigueux; St. Peter is said to have sent him to this town with the <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a> to whom later traditions assign the foundation of the church of <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>. Subsequent biographies, which appeared between the tenth and thirteenth centuries, make St. Front's life one with that of St. Fronto of Nitria, thereby giving it an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> colouring. At all events we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by the Chronicle of Sulpicius Severus that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of P&eacute;rigueux, Paternus, was deposed for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> about 361. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are: Raymond V, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Pons (1220-1223); the future <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, Blessed Elie de Bourdeilles (1447-1468); Claude de Longwy, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Givry (1540-1547); the future <a href="../cathen/06684b.htm">Cardinal Gousset</a> (1836-1840), subsequently <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>.

<p>The Abbey of Saint-Sauveur of Sarlat, later placed under the patronage of St. Sacerdos, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, seems to have existed before the reigns of Pepin the Short and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> who came there in <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> and because of their munificence deserved to be called "founders" in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> (1153). About 936 St. Odo, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, was sent to reform the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was made an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, 13 Jan., 1318.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Sarlat were Cardinal Nicolas de Gaddi (1535-1546) and the preacher Jean de Lingendes (1639-1650).

<p>Vesuna (subsequently P&eacute;rigueux) was in the fifth century the site of an important <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; it had distinguished professors: Paulinus the rhetorician; his son Paulinus the poet, who wrote (between 465 and 470) a poem on the life of St. Martin and another poem on the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cure of his grandson by St. Martin; two named Anthedius; and Lupus, poet, rhetorician, and mathematician. Two <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> were held at P&eacute;rigueux in 1368 and 1856.

<p>The history of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Front of P&eacute;rigueux gave rise to numerous discussions between arch&aelig;ologists. F&eacute;lix de Verneihl claims that St. Front was a copy of St. Mark's (Venice); Quicherat, that it was copied from the church of the Holy Apostles of Constantinople. M. Brutails is of opinion that if St. Front reveals an imitation of Oriental art, the construction differs altogether from Byzantine methods. The dates 984-1047, often given for the erection of St. Front, he considers too early; he thinks that the present <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Front was built about 1120-1173, in imitation of a foreign monument by a native local <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of architecture which erected the other domed buildings in the south-west of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>St. Vincent de Paul was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 23 Sept., 1600, by Bourdeilles, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of P&eacute;rigueux. <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, born in the Diocese of Sarlat, was titular of the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Carinac which his uncle Fran&ccedil;ois de Salignac, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sarlat, had given him. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of P&eacute;rigueux is the only one in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to celebrate the feast of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (28 Jan.). This Church has a special veneration for Saints Silanus, Severinus, Severianus, and Frontasius, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, disciples of St. Front; St. Mundana, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, mother of St. Sacerdos, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a> (sixth century); the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> St. Cyprian, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the P&eacute;rigueux <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (sixth century); St. Sour (Sorus), a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> who died about 580, founder of the Abbey of Terrasson. The <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> St. Peter Thomas (1305-1366), a native of Salles in the Diocese and <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, died in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> during the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> which for a short time gave Alexandria to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.

<p>The Diocese of P&eacute;rigueux has a remarkable <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>: Pierre Raoul or G&eacute;rard, a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in P&eacute;rigord, brought back after the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a> the Holy Shroud of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, entrusted to him by a dying ecclesiastic of <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>, who himself obtained this <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> from the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Adh&eacute;mar de Monteil. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> who founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cadouin in 1115 had a church erected in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of this <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>; its <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, a marvel of art, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1154. Notwithstanding the strict rules of the order interdicting the use of gold vases, the Chapter of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> permitted a gold <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> for the Holy Shroud. As early as 1140, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> instituted a confraternity in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Holy Shroud, thought to be the oldest in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. St. Louis in 1270 <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> the Holy Shroud at Cadouin; Charles VI had it exposed for one month in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Louis XI founded at Cadouin in 1482 a daily Mass. Bishop Lingendes in 1444 held an official investigation which asserted the authenticity of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a>. The other chief places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: at Belv&egrave;s, a shrine of Notre-Dame de Capelou, mentioned in 1153 in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a>. Notre-Dame de Fontpeyrines; Notre-Dame du Grand Pouvoir at P&eacute;rigueux, dating back to 1673; Notre-Dame des Vertus, dating back to 1653; Notre-Dame de Temniac, near Sarlat, a shrine where <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> established a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>; Notre-Dame de Coulaures; Notre-Dame des Ronces at Nontron, dating back to the beginning of the seventeenth century.

<p>Prior to the enforcement of the Law of 1901, there were in the Diocese of P&eacute;rigueux, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, and various orders of teaching <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">Brothers</a>. The Congregation of Sisters of St. Martha, founded in 1643 (mother-house at P&eacute;rigueux), is an important nursing and teaching order. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Clarisses of Notre-Dame de la Garde, at P&eacute;rigueux, was founded by two <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> whom <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare</a> had personally sent from <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>. At the beginning of the twentieth century the Diocese of P&eacute;rigueux had the following religious institutions: 15 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for boys, 5 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 4 houses of shelter, 25 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or asylums, 3 houses of visiting nurses, 1 house of retreat. In 1905 (the end of the period covered by the Concordat) the diocese had a population of 452,951 inhabitants, with 69 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 467 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 45 vicariates supported by the State.
