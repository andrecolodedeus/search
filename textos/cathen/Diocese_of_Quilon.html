<p>(QUILONENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Quilon, in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> on the Malabar coast, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15345a.htm">Verapoly</a>, comprises the southern half of the native state of Travancore, and the British territories of Tangacherry and Anjengo. It stretches from the northern branch of the River Ranee down to Cape Comorin, is bounded on the east by the slope of the <em>Ghauts</em>, and on the west by the Indian Ocean, on the coast of which, however, there is one narrow strip belonging to the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a>.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Down to 1838 the territory comprised by this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> formed part of the Padroado <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Diocese of Cochin</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">DIOCESE OF COCHIN</a>). In that year, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Multa Pr&aelig;clare", <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">See of Cochin</a>, and this portion of its territory was placed under the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Malabar (Verapoly).
