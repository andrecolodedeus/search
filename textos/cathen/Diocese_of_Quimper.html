<h1>Diocese of Quimper</h1>  

<p>(CORISOPITENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Quimper includes the Department of Finist&egrave;re; as re-established by the Concordat of 1802 it embraces a large portion of the ancient Diocese of Quimper, also known as the Diocese of Cornouailles, the whole of the Diocese of St. Pol de L&eacute;on, and a small part of the Dioceses of Tr&eacute;guier and <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>. From 1802 to 1859 it was suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and since 1859 it has been a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Diocese of Quimper</h2>

<p>We have two versions of the catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Quimper: one in the Cartulary of Quimperl&eacute;, of the twelfth century; the other preserved in a Quimper cartulary of the fifteenth century. Both mention a St. Corentinus as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quimper; his biography is of very late origin. Nothing accurate is known about him, but he is supposed by some to have been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by St. Martin in the fourth century, while others claim that he was a sixth-century <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Duchesne has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the Diocese of Quimper must have been represented at the Council of Angers (453) by one of the four <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, Sarmatio, Chariato, Rumoridus, and Viventius, and at the Council of <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a> (c. 465) by one of the two <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> Albinus and Liberatus. He puts little credence in the traditions that make St. Gonoganus (Goennoc) or St. Allorus (Alori) successors of St. Corentinus. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> my be mentioned: Philippe de La Chambre, Cardinal de Boulogne (1546-50); Nicholas Cajetan (1550-60); Cardinal de Sermonetta, in 1536.
<h2 id="section2">Diocese of St. Pol de L&eacute;on</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> seems to have been preached in L&eacute;on twenty years before the evangelization of Cornouaille, but ancient Breton <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> is very uncertain. The legend of St. Paul Aurelian, written in 884, shows that the Breton <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> believed the See of L&eacute;on had been founded in the Merovingian epoch. Paul Aurelian, a Gallic <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, founder of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Ouessant on the north-west coast of Brittany and on the Island of Batz, was believed to have founded in an abandoned fort a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which gave origin to the town of St. Pol de L&eacute;on, afterwards the seat of a diocese. He was the first titular of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, a wonder-worker and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years, after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors. Some of the legends give the names of three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> among his successors: Golvinus (Goulven), Tenenanus (Th&eacute;n&eacute;nan), and Guesnoveus (Gouesnon). Duchesne accepts as certain that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of L&eacute;on was founded by Paul Aurelian during the sixth century. As for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> it would appear that the <em>civitas</em> of the Ossismi to which the territory of L&eacute;on belonged, was represented at the Council of Angers (453) and of <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a> (c. 465) by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but the chief town of that <em>civitas</em> (afterwards known as Carhaix) was soon after included in the Diocese of Quimper; and this ancient Diocese of the Ossismi, from which the chief town in the <em>civitas</em> was thus cut off, was translated to St. Pol de L&eacute;on at an uncertain date. Duchesne thinks that the Lithardus Uxomensis (not Oximensis) who assisted in 511 at the Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13681d.htm">S&eacute;ez</a> and not of L&eacute;on. It is at least certain that there are traces in history of a Diocese of L&eacute;on as far back as the middle of the ninth century.

<p>Jean Fran&ccedil;ois de La Marche, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Pol de L&eacute;on from 1772, took refuge in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1792, and organized material assistance for the &eacute;migr&eacute; <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, as well as spiritual comfort for the French <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> detained in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; he obtained a grant of the Castle of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and gathered there no less than eight hundred of them. He died in 1806.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, <a href="../cathen/13180a.htm">St. Ronan</a>, a native of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, often held to be one of the 350 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, was in the fifth century one of the apostles of Cornouailles and the neighbourhood around L&eacute;on. In his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, every six years, on the second and third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of July, the "Great Trom&egrave;nie" is held, an immense procession of fifteen or twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, through 5 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, halting at 12 improvised <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. It was mainly the Dioceses of Quimper and St. Pol de L&eacute;on that saw the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the great apostles of Brittany in the seventeenth century: the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Michel Le Nobletz (1577-1652), who has been declared Venerable, native of Plouguerneau in the Diocese of L&eacute;on, and who preached the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> in the churches and in the public squares with the help of symbolical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> charts; and his famous disciple, the Venerable Julien Maunoir, S.J. (1606-83), whose sermons were extremely popular. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Albert Le Grand, born at Morlaix, assisted this great religious revival by his "Lives of the Saints of Brittany" (1636). Maunoir found time to publish a Breton dictionary, and some devotional works in Breton. He was the founder of Breton philology.

<p>The cornerstone of Quimper Cathedral was laid in 1424, but the building was still unfinished at the beginning of the sixteenth century. When <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> granted that church the same <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> as could be gained at the Roman Jubilee, funds came in which allowed its completion.

<p>The Cathedral of St. Pol de L&eacute;on was built between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries. The church of Notre Dame de Creisker, in the same town, restored in the fourteenth century, has a <a href="../cathen/02394d.htm">belfry</a> which the Bretons claim to be the handsomest in the world. Formerly Quimperl&eacute; had an important <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, Sainte Croix, founded in 1029, and where the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of St. Maur took up their residence in 1665. It was suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. Brest, one of the great fortified harbours of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, is in the diocese.

<p>Among <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> specially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are St. Hiltutus (Iltut or Ydeuc), disciple of St. Cadoc and founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Lan-Iltut, where he had for disciples St. David, <a href="../cathen/06557c.htm">St. Gildas</a> the Albanian, <a href="../cathen/13422c.htm">St. Samson</a>, St. Magloire; St. Guengalaenus (Gu&eacute;nol&eacute;), founder and first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Landevennec, who died, according to some, about 448, according to others in 532, or as others compute in 616; <a href="../cathen/06557c.htm">St. Gildas</a>, founder and first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Rhuys and many other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Cornouailles (sixth century); St. Guevroc, Arch-deacon of St. Pol de L&eacute;on, disciple of St. Tudgual, and founder of the church of Notre Dame de Creisker (sixth century); the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, St. Herv&aelig;us (sixth century); St. Melorius (Melar), a Breton prince, a victim of a political conspiracy, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (sixth century); the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> (d. 1191), founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Carno&euml;t; St Jean Discalceat (d. 1349), founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Francis at Quimper.

<p>Le Coz (1740-1815), who under the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a> (1790-1802), was one of the mainstays of the constitutional <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, had previously been principal of Quimper College.

<p>Among those born in the Diocese of Quimper are: the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/02711a.htm">Bougeant</a> (1690-1743), author of the "History of the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>"; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> (1646-1729); the critic Fr&eacute;ron (1719-71), who opposed Voltaire; Abb&eacute; Legris Duval (1765-1819), who under the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> directed the "Congr&eacute;gation" for a time, after having founded many charitable and philanthropic institutions.

<p>The principal shrines of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre Dame de Folgoet, near Lesneven, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1419; Notre Dame de Loemaria at Quimper, a church which dates from the eleventh century, when the Abbey of Loemaria was founded by Count Alain Canihart (1013-40); Notre Dame de Rumengol, near Faou, a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> founded 1500 years ago, replaced in 1536 by a large church where the unique religious festivals known as "Great Pardons" take place.

<p>Before the application of the Associations Law (1901), there were in the diocese <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of the "Pierre qui vire", and many teaching orders of brothers. An important <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> originated in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the Religious de la Retraite du Sacr&eacute;-Coeur. In 1899 the religious congregations in the Diocese of Quimper had charge of 1 <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling hospital</a>, 35 nurseries, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for boys, 9 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 10 workrooms, 4 refuges, 29 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 166 district nursing houses, and 8 houses of retreat. In 1905 there were in the Diocese of Quimper 773,614 inhabitants, 48 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 262 auxiliary <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 280 curacies supported by state funds.
