<h1>Diocese of Richmond</h1>  

<p>(RICHMONDENSIS.)

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, established 11 July, 1820, comprises the <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">State of Virginia</a>, except the Counties of Accomac and Northampton (<a href="../cathen/15646c.htm">Diocese of Wilmington</a>); and Bland, Buchanan, Carroll, Craig (partly), Dickinson, Floyd, Giles, Grayson, Lee, Montgomery, Pulaski, Russell, Scott, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington, Wise, and Wythe (<a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Diocese of Wheeling</a>); and in the <a href="../cathen/15605a.htm">State of West Virginia</a>, the Counties of Berkeley, Grant, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Mineral, Morgan, and Pendleton. It embraces 31,518 square miles in <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a> and 3290 square miles in <a href="../cathen/15605a.htm">West Virginia</a>. Originally it included also the territory of the present <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Diocese of Wheeling</a>, created 23 July, 1850.
<h2>Colonial period</h2>

<p>In the summer of 1526 a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlement was made in Virginia on the very spot (according to Ecija, the pilot-in-chief of Florida) where, in 1607, eighty-one years later, the English founded the settlement of Jamestown. <a href="../cathen/02164c.htm">Lucas Vasques de Ayll&oacute;n</a>, one of the judges of the island of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">San Domingo</a>, received from the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 12 June, 1523, a patent empowering him to explore the coast for 800 leagues, establish a settlement within three years and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianize</a> the natives. In June, 1526, <a href="../cathen/02164c.htm">Ayll&oacute;n</a> sailed from Puerto de la Plata, <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">San Domingo</a>, with three vessels, 600 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of both sexes, horses and supplies. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> <a href="../cathen/10534b.htm">Antonio de Montesinos</a> and Antonio de Cervantes, with Brother Peter de Estrada, accompanied the expedition. Entering the Capes at the Chesapeake, and ascending a river (the James), he landed at Guandape, which he named St. Michael. Buildings were constructed and the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> offered in a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, the second place of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship on American soil. <a href="../cathen/02164c.htm">Ayll&oacute;n</a> died of fever, 18 Oct., 1526. The rebellion of the settlers and hostility of the Indians caused Francisco Gomez, the next in command, to abandon the settlement in the spring of 1527, when he set sail for San Domingo in two vessels, one of which foundered. Of the party only 150 reached their destination.

<p>A second expedition sent by Menendez, the Governor of Florida and nominal Governor of Virginia, settled on the Rappahannock River at a point called Axacan, 10 Sept., 1570. It consisted of Fathers Segura, Vice-Provincial of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and Luis de Quiros, six <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> brothers, and a few friendly Indians. A log building served as <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and home. Through the treachery of Don Luis de Velasco, an Indian pilot of Spanish name, Father Quiros and Brothers Solis and Mendez were slain by the Indians, 14 Feb., 1571. Four days later were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> Father Segura, Brothers Linares, Redondo, Gabriel, Gomez, and Sancho Zevalles. Menendez, several months later, sailed for Axacan, where he had eight of the murderers hanged; they being converted before death by Father John Rogel, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary.

<p>Attempts to found <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlements in Virginia were made by Lord Baltimore in 1629, and Captain George Brent in 1687. In the spring of 1634 Father John Altham, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> companion of <a href="../cathen/15610b.htm">Father Andrew White</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> missionary, laboured amongst some of the Virginia tribes on the south side of the Potomac. Stringent <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were soon enacted in Virginia against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1687 Fathers Edmonds and Raymond were arrested at Norfolk for exercising their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions. During the last quarter of the eighteenth century the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers at Aquia Creek, near the Potomac, were attended by Father John Carroll and other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries from <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>.
<h2>American period</h2>

<p>Rev. Jean Dubois, afterwards third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New York, accompanied by a few <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and with letters of introduction from Lafayette to several prominent Virginia <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, came to Norfolk in August, 1791, where he laboured a few months, and probably left the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who came with him. Proceeding to Richmond towards the end of the year, he offered in the House of Delegates, by invitation of the General Assembly, the first Mass ever said in the Capital City. His successors at Richmond, with interruptions, were the Revs. T.C. Mongrand, Xavier Michel, John McElroy, John Baxter, John Mahoney, James Walsh, Thomas Hore, and Fathers Horner and Schreiber.

<p>Tradition tells us that at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, probably at the time of the Declaration of Independence, Alexandria had a log <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> with an unknown resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Rev. John Thayer of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> was stationed there in 1794. Rev. Francis Neale, who in 1796 constructed at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> a brick church, erected fourteen years later a more suitable church where Fathers Kohlmann, Enoch, and Benedict Joseph Fenwick, afterwards second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, frequently officiated. About 1796 Rev. James Bushe began the erection of a church at Norfolk. His successors were the Very Rev. Leonard Neale, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (see Baltimore, Archdiocese of), Revs. Michael Lacy, Christopher Delaney, Joseph Stokes, Samuel Cooper, J. VanHorsigh, and A.L. Hitzelberger.
<h2>Bishops of Richmond</h2>

<p>(1) Right Rev. Patrick Kelly, D.D., <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Richmond, 24 Aug., 1820, came to reside at Norfolk, where the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were much more numerous than at Richmond, 19 Jan., 1821. The erection of <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a> into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> had been premature and was accordingly opposed by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Because of factions and various other difficulties, Bishop Kelly soon petitioned <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be relieved of his charge. He left Virginia in July, 1822, having been transferred to the <a href="../cathen/15564b.htm">See of Waterford and Lismore</a>, where he died, 8 Oct., 1829. Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> was appointed administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.



<p>Rev. Timothy O'Brien, who came as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> to Richmond in 1832, did more for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> during his eighteen years' labour than any other missionary, excepting the Bishops of the See. In 1834 he built St. Peter's Church, afterwards the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and founded St. Joseph's Female Academy and Orphan Asylum, bringing as teachers three Sisters of Charity.

<p>(2) The Right Rev. Richard Vincent Whelan, D.D., <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 21 March, 1841, established the same year, on the outskirts of Richmond, St. Vincent's Seminary and College, discontinued in 1846. Leaving Rev. Timothy O'Brien at St. Peter's, Richmond, the Bishop took up his residence at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and acted as president. In 1842 Bishop Whelan dedicated St. Joseph's Church, Petersburg, and St. Patrick's Church, Norfolk, and the following year that of St.Francis at Lynchburg. In 1846 he built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> at <a href="../cathen/15608a.htm">Wheeling</a> and, two years later, founded at Norfolk St. Vincent's Female Orphan Asylum. Wheeling was made a separate see, 23 July, 1850, and to it was transferred Bishop Whelan.

<p>(3) Right Rev. John McGill, D.D., <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 10 Nov., 1850, was present in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1854 when the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception was proclaimed. By pen and voice he opposed <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Knownothingism</a>. In 1855 Bishop McGill convened the First Diocesan Synod. During the yellow fever plague of the same year, Rev. Matthew O'Keefe of Norfolk and Rev. Francis Devlin of <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a> won renown; the latter dying a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. In 1856 St. Vincent's Hospital, Norfolk, was founded. Alexandria, formerly in the Baltimore archdiocese as part of the <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">District of Columbia</a>, but ceded back to <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, was annexed to the Richmond diocese, 15 Aug., 1858. In 1860 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> transferred St. Mary's German Church, Richmond, to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. During the Civil War Bishop McGill wrote two learned works, "The True Church Indicated to the Inquirer", and "Our Faith, the Victory", republished as "The Creed of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>". The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> established at Richmond the Sisters of the Visitation, and at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> the <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>. He also took part in the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. Bishop McGill died at Richmond, 14 January, 1872.

<p>(4) Right Rev. James Gibbons, D.D. (afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>), <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Adramyttum to organize North Carolina into a vicariate, 16 Aug., 1868, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Richmond, 30 July, 1872. He established at Richmond the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, and St. Peter's Boys' Academy. Erecting new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, making constant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> visitations, frequently preaching to large congregations of both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics, Bishop Gibbons, during his short rule of five years, accomplished in the diocese a vast amount of religious good. Made coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 29 May, 1877, he succeeded Archbishop Bayley in that see, 3 Oct., 1877.

<p>(5) Right Rev. John Joseph Keane, D.D. (afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>), <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 25 Aug., 1878. Gifted with ever-ready and magnetic eloquence, Bishop Keane drew great numbers of people to hear his inspiring discourses. He held the Second Diocesan Synod in 1886, and introduced into the diocese the <a href="../cathen/08519b.htm">Josephites</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15728b.htm">Xaverian Brothers</a>. Bishop Keane was appointed first Rector of the Catholic University, Washington, 12 Aug., 1888, created titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, 9 Jan., 1897, and transferred to the See of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, 24 July, 1900.

<p>(6) Right Rev. Augustine Van De Vyver, D.D., <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 29 Oct., 1889, began an able and vigorous rule. On 3 June, 1903, he publicly received the Most Rev. Diomede Falconio, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a>, who the following day laid the cornerstone of the new Sacred Heart Cathedral, one of the most artistic edifices in the country, designed by Joseph McGuire, architect, of New York. A handsome <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> house and a pastoral residence adjoin the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The latter was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> consecrated by Mgr. Falconio on 29 Nov., 1906. The event was the most imposing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> in the history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Besides Cardinal Gibbons, and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a>, there were present 18 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Bishop Van De Vyver convened a quasi-synod, 12 Nov., 1907, which approved the decrees of the Second Synod and enacted new and needed legislation. In 1907 the <a href="../cathen/08670c.htm">Knights of Columbus</a> held at the Jamestown Exposition their national convention and jubilee celebration, participated in by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a>, and several <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; while the following year the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a> held a similar celebration in Richmond. In June, 1909, St. Peter's (Richmond) handsome new residence and the adjoining home of the McGill Union and the <a href="../cathen/08670c.htm">Knights of Columbus</a> were completed, at a total cost of about $50,000. In the following autumn St. Peter's Church (the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>) celebrated the diamond jubilee of its existence. With it, either as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, are indelibly linked the names of Cardinal Gibbons, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Keane and Janssens, and Bishops Van De Vyver, Whelan, McGill, <a href="../cathen/02382a.htm">Becker</a>, Kelley and O'Connell of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>. Most Rev. John J. Kain, deceased <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of St. Louis, had also been a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Bishop Van De Vyver introduced into the diocese the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a>; additional <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> and Josephite Fathers and <a href="../cathen/15728b.htm">Xaverian Brothers</a>; the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>; additional Sisters of Charity; the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters; <a href="../cathen/10724c.htm">Sisters of Charity of Nazareth</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and of the Perpetual Adoration. Under his regime have been founded 12 new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 32 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 3 colleges, 4 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylum</a> (coloured), and many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.
<h2>Notable benefactors</h2>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Fortune Ryan, of New York, the former donating, the latter furnishing, the imposing Sacred Heart Cathedral (nearly $500,000), together with other notable benefactions. Mrs.Ryan has built churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in various parts of the state.
