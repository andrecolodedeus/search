<h1>Diocese of Rochester</h1>  

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, on its establishment by separation from the <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">See of Buffalo</a>, 24 January, 1868, comprised the counties of Monroe, Livingston, Wayne, <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, Seneca, Cayuga, Yates, and Tompkins in the state of New York. In 1896, after the death of Bishop Ryan of <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, the boundary line of the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> was somewhat changed, the counties of Steuben, Schuyler, Chemung, and Tioga being detached from the <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">See of Buffalo</a> and added to that of Rochester.
<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>(1) Rev. Bernard J. McQuaid, who became a pioneer and leader in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and the founder of a model <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Rochester in St. Patrick's Cathedral, <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York City</a>, on 12 July, 1868. Four days later he took possession of his small and poor diocese, containing only sixty churches administered by thirty-eight <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, seven of whom were <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a>. When he died, 18 Jan., 1909, after forty years spent in a laborious episcopate, his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was richly furnished with churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, answering the manifold needs of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, then estimated at 121,000.

<p>(2) Rev. Thomas F. Hickey was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Rochester, 24 May, 1905, having been appointed coadjutor to <a href="../cathen/09507b.htm">Bishop McQuaid</a>.
<h2>Churches</h2>

<p>The steady growth of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population in the Diocese of Rochester, due mainly to immigration of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, German, French, Polish, Italian, Lithuanian and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, taxed the resources at the disposal of Bishop McQuaid, who was anxious throughout his entire episcopate to supply the people with churches and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their own nationality and language, whenever they were willing and able to support them. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were not allowed to become unwieldy, but were increased in number to meet the needs and conveniences of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The problem of spiritual ministration to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> dwelling at watering- places in the diocese in the summer found a good solution in the erection of neat summer <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>.
<h2>Catholic education</h2>

<p>The common <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the Diocese of Rochester at the time of its creation professed to be non-sectarian. Bishop McQuaid felt that they were very dangerous to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> child which really finds its church in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. He sought a remedy in a vigorous agitation for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, contributing to the support of the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system by their taxes, to receive public money for the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, in which their children could be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> with that "amount and description of religious instruction" which <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> tells them is good, expedient, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The failure of the State to remedy the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> was met with the firm command of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> which was put into execution as soon as possible throughout the diocese: "Build schoolhouses then for the religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of your children as the best protest against a system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from which religion has been excluded by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>." At Rochester in 1868, there were 2056 children in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the five German churches, and 441 children in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> attached to the Churches of St. Patrick and St. Mary. Both of these had a select or pay <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and a free, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, or poor <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, admitting invidious distinctions very distasteful to the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>Outside of Rochester <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were attached to a few churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but with a very small attendance. These were the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> beginnings of the admirable <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system, which embraces today practically all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> age in the diocese. Not all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were brought to their present high degree of efficiency at once; it took many years and persistent effort to accomplish this work. The brothers gradually yielded their places to the sisters, who now teach all the children in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, both boys and girls. Bishop McQuaid spared no pains in developing good teachers in his own order of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, for whom a normal training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was established. Occasional "teachers' institutes" organized for the benefit of these sisterhoods in Rochester prepared the way for the annual conference held by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> teachers in the episcopal city since 1904, at which the various orders meet to discuss <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> problems and to perfect in every possible way the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system.

<p>As early as 1855 the Ladies of the Sacred Heart transferred their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in Buffalo to Rochester as a more central point for their academy. About the same time the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> in Canandaigua opened St. Mary's academy for young ladies, now Nazareth Academy attached to the new motherhouse of the order in Rochester. Advanced courses were also introduced in 1903 into the Cathedral <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> under the direction of Bishop Hickey, who, in 1906, converted the old Cathedral Hall into a high school, classical and commercial, open to both girls and boys.



<p><em>Ecclesiastical</em>

<p>(a) Preparatory.--Believing that it was hard for a boy to become a worthy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> without first leading the normal life of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in the world, Bishop McQuaid planned his preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> as a free day-school and not a boarding-school, the students living at home under the care of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or in a boarding house approved by the superiors. Within two years after the erection of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, this plan was realized. On his return from the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in 1870, St. Andrew's Preparatory Seminary was opened in a small building to the rear of the episcopal residence. It has already given nearly 175 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Rochester. The rule has been made to adopt no one in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> who has not spent at least two years in St. Andrew's Seminary. Through the generosity of Mgr. H. De Regge and some others, Bishop McQuaid was enabled to erect a new building in 1880 and to enlarge it in 1889; and in 1904 the younger <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> furnished him with funds to erect a fire-proof structure with fitting accommodations for the work of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>.

<p>(b) Theological.--For many years the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students of the Diocese of Rochester were sent mainly to the provincial <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Troy or to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Innsbruck in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In 1879 Bishop McQuaid put aside a small legacy bequeathed him as a nucleus of a fund for the erection of suitable buildings for a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Although the fund grew slowly, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> would not lay the first stone until nearly all the money needed for the work was in hand, nor would he open the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for students until the buildings were completed and paid for, and at least four professorships endowed. In April, 1887, he was able to purchase a site on the bank of the Genesee River gorge, only three miles from the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Four years later he began the erection of the buildings. In two years they were completed, and in September, 1893, the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was opened with 39 students. Applications for admission soon came from various parts of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Four years after its establishment, it became evident that more room was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. A fund for an additional building was begun and in 1900, the Hall of Philosophy and Science was erected with accommodations for class-rooms, <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and living rooms. In the following year Bishop McQuaid received a recognition for these labours from <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> granting to himself and his successors the power of conferring degrees in Philosophy and Theology. The Hall of Theology was begun in 1907 and solemnly dedicated 20 August, 1908. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> founded the ninth endowed professorship in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> jubilee. An infirmary for sick students was in process of construction when Bishop McQuaid died.
<h2>Charities</h2>

<p>Though <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was the primary concern of <a href="../cathen/09507b.htm">Bishop McQuaid</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, ample provision for its <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charities</a> was not lacking.

<p>(1) As early as 1845 the R.C.A. Society of Rochester, already in existence some years, was incorporated, having for its object the support of the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> girls in St. Patrick's Female Orphan Asylum at Rochester and the support of the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> boys sent to the Boys' Asylum, either at Lancaster, New York, or at Lime Stone Hill near Buffalo. In 1864 St. Mary's Boys' Orphan Asylum was also established in Rochester under the care of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, to whom also the Girls' Orphan Asylum was confided in 1870 on the resignation of the Sisters of Charity hitherto in charge. When the Auburn Orphan Asylum, incorporated in 1853, was transferred to Rochester in 1910, all this work was then centralized in the episcopal city. Here also special provision had been made for the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> since 1866, when St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum was erected and placed under the care of the Sisters of Notre-Dame.

<p>(2) In 1873 a short-lived attempt was made to supplement the work of St. Mary's Orphan Asylum by giving the boys of suitable age an opportunity of acquiring a practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of farming or of a useful trade. A similar institution for girls flourished under Mother Hieronymo for some twenty years under the name of The Home of Industry which then was changed into a home for the aged. The location did not prove desirable for such an institution, and $65,000 having been raised by a bazaar, Bishop McQuaid was enabled to erect St. Anne's Home for the Aged, admitting men as well as <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p>(3) The spiritual needs of another class of the destitute, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inmates of public eleemosynary and penal institution in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, appealed strongly to Bishop McQuaid, who at once became their champion in the endeavour to have their religious <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> respected according to the guarantee of the Constitution of the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>. His agitation in this noble cause was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with success, and the State supports today <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> at the State Industrial School, Industry, at the State Reformatory, Elmira, at the Craig Colony (state <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for epileptics), Sonyea, at the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home, Bath, while the county maintains a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in Rochester for its public institutions of this kind.

<p>(4) The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sick have one of the largest and best equipped <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> in Rochester at their disposal in St. Mary's Hospital, established by the Sisters of Charity under Mother Hieronymo in 1857. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> have charge of St. James Hospital in Hornell, and of late years the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> have also opened a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in Elmira.
